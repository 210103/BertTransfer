"Beautiful restaurant, with a friendly staff. Extensive selection of wine, and reasonably priced beer. I'm a big fan of the happy hour specials.\n\nThe bruschetta is delicious. My personal favorite is red bell peppers with goat cheese. I really like that you can pick for different toppings for a single serving - it's a great way to sample all the different types of bruschetta. The bellinis are also really good if you're not in a beer or wine mood.\n\nI really need to go back and try more of the menu. Can't wait!",1
"We stopped here last night and glad we did.  The choice of four bruschetta was awesome loved them all white bean, artichoke, burrata and mozzarella. My glass of Manifesto Zin was really good as well.  A nicely appointed restaurant that I would frequent more given the chance.",1
You must get the Brushetta and order the roasted bell peppers and goat cheese! One of the best! It is usually pretty crowded and can be kind of noisy but if you know that going in ask to sit on the patio!,1
"I have only gone to Postino during the Monday/Tuesday $20 nights where you get a bottle of wine and choice of 3 bruschettas for the cheap price of $20.  I always order a bottle of moscato d'asti and a trio of Brie & Apples with fig, Prosciutto with figs & mascarpone and Fresh Mozzarella with tomato and basil.  I usually go with a few of my girlfriends and this makes a great meal with fantastic wine and some good gossip. :)  Come early as seats fill up extremely quickly and the wait can get very long.  This deal starts after 8pm.",1
"I try to like you Postinos, I really do but you make it so hard.  Came on a Tuesday for their 8 PM $20 Bottle of wine and bruschetta special and left disappointed and annoyed.\n\nThe parking lot disaster strikes again!  LGO now put up signs saying 25 min parking for LGO customers only and has a lot monkey stationed to chase away people trying to park in those spaces.  I was told by the lot monkey that I could valet ($3 charge) or I could park 3 blocks away if I didn't want to pay the fee.  Keep in mind this is a Tuesday and I have to pay to park my car because the restaurant blocks off all the spaces.\n\nOnce seated my friend and I tried to catch up for a moment when the server came over to take our drink orders.  Since we had just sat down we asked for some time to take a look at the menu.  Our server came back a few minutes later and asked if we were ready to order.  No suggestions on a wine, no questions if we had questions, just \""""you ready to order?\""""\n\nWe ordered a bottle and bruschetta and our waiter disappeared.  For the rest of the night.  I watched him refill wine glasses at other tables, ours was brought by another server.  Other tables had their plates cleared when they were finished, ours sat in front of us until another server took them away.  Our server obviously didn't want our business because about an hour after we sat down he came back to the table and asked if we were interested in any dessert.  We said no and he immediately dropped the check on the table and left.  No offer of another round of drinks, just here is your check.\n\nThe wine we had was amazing and was a steal at the price plus the bruschetta.  The bruschetta themselves were half assed.  3 of the 4 weren't even sliced all the way through but over all they were decent.\n\nYet again Postinos shows they want my money but not my patronage.  I don't understand how I am the only one who keeps having horrible experiences here?",0
"I totally 100% agree w Serianna T.\n\nI have felt the same way about the seating, and parking and mediocre foods... Postino and LGO are complete cluster F***s for anyone who plans on driving there. I also feel like the general atmosphere is trying so hard to be relaxed and casual that it is stressful for the guests.",0
I liked it. The food was pretty good and the wine and beer selections were great.  It's definitely more of a happy hour spot for me though.,1
"Wow, looks like this makes review #700 for Postino's! I'm sure by now you all have heard of the great Monday night deal which includes a bottle of wine and their yummy bruschetta, and it doesn't really matter what kind of bruschetta you get, because its all delicious so they are all good choices. Other than the good monday night deal, this is simply just an overall cool little quaint spot to spend a couple hours, especially great for a date. It's dark, and intimate, nice baby-making music playing in the background... \n\nNot too many drawbacks I can think of other than parking being limited, and since it is a fairly small location, it can get crowded quick. Oh, and I must confess I did find it just a smidgen on the hipster side, but not enough to keep me away thats for sure.",1
"So cute, I love this place! My profile picture was actually taken there. Very great patio, we held a post graduation party with about 20 people and it was perfect. One person in our party unrolled her napking to find a coupon for a free dinner in the napkin, what a great idea! Very fun atmosphere.",1
Super good time!,1
"Love coming here for $20 Tuesday deal; you just can't beat it.  I have to say, the salmon Bruschetta is my favorite of all of them.  The bottle deal can't be beat and the selections are nice. Very broad.  They change it every couple months as well, so always trying new wines.  Highly recommend getting a reservation because it's always packed on Tuesdays.  The service is great, though sometimes, if they are having a bad day, they tend to complain about how busy they are.  While I empathize, I'm here to relax and get away from my work troubles. Just be patient with them and they will treat you right.",1
"The atmosphere there is great, the food is pretty simple but tastey. I go there for their wine. It really is a great selection and the staff is pretty knowledgeable. I had the tuna sandwich for the first time the other day, cause I normally get the brushetta(sp?) and it was really good. It wasn't mayonnaise-ey. I would also recommend the nine iron.",1
Good bruschetta and sandwiches. $5 wines by the glass til 5 pm. Great for people watching. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Cool wines by the glass and bottle. Unique wines to take home too.,1
"First time here and very impressed! My wife and I brought my parents here and we loved it!  The bruschetta board is the way to go with big servings of each.  We had the red peppers and goat cheese, apple brie and dates, classic bruschetta, and the smoked salmon. All were delicious!  The atmosphere is pretty trendy, and you have to valet your car cause there is no parking around the area.  To be honest its a little hard to have conversations in there as the music was pretty loud.  I could see how they would have that cause it seemed geared more to a younger crowd.  That was the only drawback.  I also had one of their Panini's, the Nine Iron.  It was good but could of done with out so much lettuce and had more meat.  Overall a great experience and coming back again to enjoy the bruschetta board.",1
"The bruschetta is to die for, and brunch is fantastic. Don't forget the delicious mimosas!",1
Exquisite\n\nFine wine and tasty appetizers \n\nGreat place for evening get together with friends or a table for two with a special someone!\n\nHighly recommended for people who enjoy the finer things in life.,1
"Can I just say \""""Bella Postino\""""  yummm.",1
"\""""Eat me\""""\n\nYep, that's what everything (the food) said to me as it came out. That about sums up my experience.. but read on for more specifics.\n\nService: TOP notch service. Our waiter was patient and super attentive. He knew the menu and even said, that's why I work here because EVERYTHING is good!\n\nFood: We started with the spinach artichoke/white bean hummus combo and the grilled cheese.. yes.. folks grilled cheese. This was by far the best grilled cheese I've had..ever and that says a lot. It was on a nice flaky break with the perfect amount of gooey-ness. It was served with a ketchup, fancy mustard, and pesto. Fabuloso!\n\nFor the entree - I had the tomato florentine - I felt like it was missing a spice, but it was still good. I had the chicken and mozzarella panini and the mixed greens salad. Albeit I was stuffed, it was amazing and tasted even better the next day.\n\nThe other perk is they have a focused menu. They aren't trying to be everything to everyone. Another bonus!\n\nThe open doors/windows, patio seating and coziness of the restaurant was a perk.\n\nThe only thing I wish there was more of was light. It was very hard to read the menu using a small candle. It wasn't enough for me to take this down a star though.",1
"Overpriced, mediocre food and phony.  The wines are OK but somewhat pretentious.  If you want really good food and good wines, go up the street to Hillstone on Camelback.",0
Delicious bruschetta! Loved the setting. This is a great place for a nice ladies lunch :),1
"One of my favorite restaurants in town , love the food and. Atmospheres there. Bruschetta is the best !!!",1
"My husband and I came here in late August and the weather was threatening a monsoon right as we arrived, so the restaurant interior was jam packed, I convinced the hostess that we really were okay with the risk of getting wet and she let us sit on the empty patio, which was blessedly deserted.  Our bet paid off as it didn't storm on us and instead we got to enjoy the light show and blowing trees overhead as we noshed on a mixed bruschetta board and a pub board.  \n\nI'm a big fan of their bruschetta combinations, they really have a beautiful way of combining sweet and savory ingredients in a way you wouldn't expect, but surprise your taste buds nevertheless.  I enjoyed a peach Bellini while my husband, who doesn't drink, had a really delightful cucumber honey lemonade.  As unusual sounding as it is, it's really quite amazing.  \n\nThis is such a nice place for an evening out, sans children.  If you haven't been yet you really MUST check it out; go now!",1
Ahh Postino Wine Bar... Or is it Postinos? Or Postino Wine Cafe? Whatever! \n\nI would definitely consider myself a Postino expert. Postino was a go to for countless dates of mine. I have been to all of the locations and my experience at this location has unfortunately changed. \n\nWhen I first stated going to this Postino I loved it! Me and my roommate would visit every Sunday religiously. We always got great service! Food was fantastic and timely. But it seems as if the the 40th street location is either under new management or just has new rude employees. I no longer go to this location because of a couple negative encounters with servers. I had no idea it was there business how many women I take on dates there. You would think the business would be appreciated. I was shocked when a server made a snide comment about my dating habits right in front of a lady friend. I would have been pretty pissed if that was an actual date. Very unprofessional staff at this location!\n\nI recommend going to the newer Central & Camelback location if you are planning on visiting Postino. \n\nPros:\n- cheap tasty bruschetta\n- reasonable wine prices\n- decent beers on tap\n- crazy fast but borderline annoying water refills\n- short wait times\n\nCons\n- rude servers\n- shallow menu\n- bad for taking dates,0
Nothing worth writing about except the bruschetta. Most of the wine tastes like cheap box wine and are unrecognizable labels probably stored in a warehouse! Salads are overpriced and no hot entrees...unimpressive.,0
"I'm hesitant to give 5 stars. I do it only when a place offers and experience I cannot get elsewhere.  POSTINO does that , their Bruschetta, ambiance, service and VALUE are a combination that is unmatched in Phoenix. \n\nDid I mention value? Mon & Tues you can order 4 diff types of bruschetta and an entire bottle of wine and pay $20, TOTAL. I challenge you to find a better deal.    \n\n\nBack to service , JAKE our server was great tonight, he has a very friendly demeanor and  made excellent recommendations. I've Been here about 10 times before, he was part of the reason I was compelled to write this review tonight.",1
Amazing Food and Atmosphere! Great for Couples. Sharing food is welcome and trendy here.,1
The best bruschetta ever.\nSo many delicious  flavor combinations.\nMake a meal of it.\nHighly recommended..,1
Went yesterday for the first time. It gets one star because the food was yummy. Got the choose two- Nine Iron sandwich with Mediterranean salad. Very good. Lost a star because parking is horrible despite the free but really not free valet parking. Lost a star because I do not like eating up. Meaning the table was so low you have a lot of distance to the mouth and more opportunity to spill. Lost a star because I don't like eating in my living room. Why are restaurants now making their dining room a living room? If you want to do the sofa and chair thing do it outside. Not fond of high tops either. Lost a star because they opened the garage door. We chose to sit inside for a reason. They opened it and all of a sudden it was 60 degrees.,0
Pefect food.,1
Perfect place to go hang out with a date or a group of friends. Been to both Arcadia and Postinos on Central. Brushetta is amazing and wine selection will not disappoint. Staff has been friendly at both locations as well.  Arcadia parking is a nightmare and Postinos on Central is bad but not horrible. Pricey unless you go during happy hour.,1
Had lunch of soup and sandwich here and it was delicious!  My co-workers had bruschetta board and charcuterie/olive board.  Both looked like something I'd like to try next visit.  I'll be back.,1
Everything was amazing. We got the bruschetta: you get to pick for different kinds and a panini to share. We got the iron and it is giant and delicious. More than enough food for the two of us. The wine is great. We went for happy hour $5 a glass so we just got a bottle for $20 - I'll be back!,1
Me and my wife LOVE this place! Great staff and great food. Atmosphere is fun!,1
Romantic and great food,1
"Very classy. And a classic.\nNot for a big dinner or a party over 10. \nSmall group, small bites, share a bottle, maybe a cheese board; a guaranteed good time.\n\nThey have beer too. Great beer.",1
"Be warned gluten.... Went for happy hour expecting to have GF food. Postinos said they could do gluten-free before we were seated.\nCome to find out they could only do olives truly gf once they found out it was a true allergy. \nWe were told by several different people that many items were gluten free; such as the sandwiches, but upon further questions about the meats, cheeses, etcetera being GF, they took back their reassurances. Close call to being poisoned!",0
"The bruschetta was good as always, but the artichoke and bean dips were blah and the bread was hard enough to tear up my mouth. We asked for softer French bread they say sure and brought us 3 slices! When asked for more they brought us a bowl of the hard stuff, it was quite frustrating since the service overall was bad for us. We had a server who left right after taking our initial drink order and no new server took us on. We had to flag someone new every time we needed or wanted something since no one came to check on us and that was including our food order.  I plan to stick to the one in central from now on. I've always had excellent service there.",0
Everything was phenomenal about this place except the wait time.,1
Love this place! Happy hour is great and extremely reasonable prices,1
"Not good ,, too small... n its overrated! who waits 1hr for a glass of wine., i would rather get a bottle n drink at home.",0
Great glass of Zin.  Wonderful ambiance and decor.,1
You just can't go wrong with this place!! 20$ bottle of wine and board of bruschetta Monday &Tuesday.,1
"Cactus Moon is a nice little stop over by Cabela's on 202 and Dobson. I only go there to play poker with the Dream Dealers on Tuesdays. My regular order is  the pound of wings for $5 and then usually a Three Olive Vodka special. Lots of combos there, and all are tasty. There are TVs all around the place so now that baseball season is in swing you have no problems in seeing a game if its on. The service is friendly and the food comes up quick.",1
"On a Monday/Tuesday night, if you time it right, Postino's is a neighborhood staple in Arcadia. The $20 for a bottle and board of bruschetta is a *steal*. As one of employee said, \""""How could you not order this?\"""" while we waited for our table.  \n\nMy friend and I arrived early to request a table for four. Perched on a tall side table we enjoyed a full view of the restaurant. Sipping not so daintily we quickly passed the 45 minute wait.  \n\nOnce seated Bethany was a wonder. Our bill was seamlessly transferred and waters arrived. The neat thing about traveling in a pack of four is that, Yes, You Can drink three bottles of wine. What could possibly be better than that? It removes the need to think hard about the bruschetta menu. (There are 12 options so we had one of each brought out.)\n\nWe surprised the fella in the group. He doubted that three bruschetta boards would be sufficient to feed his hungry belly. If you haven't been before, a bruschetta is palm sized and sliced into four pieces. Trust me, there's plenty. \n\nBut if you're still hungry this is a wine bar and they have food. The panini selection is wonderful, I beg to argue the Nine Iron is the best.  (Bacon layered with grilled chicken, burrata mozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and dijonnaise!) Another approach, perhaps on another visit, is to order the Butchers Block (big assortment of meat and cheese) for $14 and/or the Cheese Board for $13.\n\nIf for some reason wine is not up your alley, Postino's offers pitchers of beer. If you need to drink a cocktail...suck it up kid. That's not happening here. The Mon/Tue special begins at 8pm. I'd recommend scoring a table before the start time, even if that means buying some appetizers beforehand. \n\nMake sure to ask for Bethany! She's the sweetest thing!",1
"great service, great food",1
"Mandatory valet parking. Stuffy atmosphere. Mediocre bruschetta (especially for the price). The wine our waitress suggested was the only redeeming part of our experience. If you're in the area, try Ingo's instead.",0
Bruschetta and Panini sandwiches,1
"Really enjoyed this quaint little wine bar. Ambiance and decor were great, however it was dark so difficult to read the menu. The Waitress helped me pick out a good glass of red wine, although she liked more rose wines. The bruschetta was AMAZING!!! We tried a variety of the bruschetta: apple & bri, artichoke and prosciutto. Can't wait to go back!",1
"This restaurant occupies an old post office on a quaint corner in a residential neighborhood. The menu is simple, mostly bruscettas and salads. I prefer going before 6pm when wine is $5. a glass. During the nice weather the door opens out to the patio and you can even bring your dog. The waitstaff are all friendly and there is no bad table. Don't walk, run!",1
"Absolutely love this place. Great atmosphere. Nice wine selection too. The servers are very friendly and helpful with recommendations. Plus, their bruschetta is delish!",1
The best local wine pub if you're in the Arcadia/Biltmore area - seriously. Great paninis and bruschetta and of course ! don't forget the Red Wine ! yum try the Mozzerella and Chicken sandwich or the roasted red pepper w/ goat cheese on bread :),1
"My neighborhood spot! Great happy hour, service and vibe any day of the week. :)",1
"went on June 8th with some girlfriends\nwe sat at end of bar due to 25 min wait for table.\nWaiter had a condescending way of saying \""""you are going to eat here\""""?  \nThen later everyone got food except me, he said I did not order and I know I ordered first. The girls were confused about what to order so I also helped them choose and he said he thought I was sharing with them. He asked if I wanted to order, first I said no and then decided I would.\nHere is what ticked me off ..he said\"""" I thought I would step back until you realized the stupid thing you said\"""" I couldn't believe he would say that and from then on his service was absent.\nfood was good but his behavior as a professional server was disappointing ....",0
"Postino is delicious, reasonably priced and fun.  The only bummer is they don't have a full bar.",1
"Postinos has some of the best bruschetta I've tasted. its a classy little bistro looking place with really good lemonade as well.  its not too expensive but its definitely not cheap either. I would recommend this for a lunch type of place but not too big of a dinner,",1
"Great apps, wine and beer.  Can get a little crowded, so get there early in the evening if you can!",1
"Very trendy busy hot spot and for good reason. Yummy large chesse board with fruit nuts and bread, chicken noodle soup with real chicken and veggies :)",1
"Everyone loves this place, it's always crowded, and their happy hour prices (wine, bruschetta, salad for $20 or something like that) keep everyone coming back. My fave bruschetta is their proscuitto one, just get 4 of those and you'll be good. What I don't like is that it's hard to get seating and there is a bit of an attitude with the staff, which is rare for Phoenix. Oh, and well after all, you're still eating bruschetta, one of the few things I can actually make myself at home.",1
"All aboard for Brunch!  We are a Sunday Morning look for a great breakfast kind of people.  Our best friends told us that this place in the Arcadia district was now serving Brunch from 9AM and to check it out.  We arrived like 9:15AM with much apprehension as we were the only couple in the place.  The menu was limited but looked decent.  Oh My Goodness!  My wife ordered the Ciabatta French Toast.  Now she claims to just hate Ciabatta bread, but she was not in the mood for eggs.  ***** That was the 5-star rating she gave the dish as it was (as she admitted) the best French Toast she ever tasted.  I on the other hand always go for the biggest dish, so I ordered their Farm Scramble - Eggs, potatoes, onions,  \""""secret\""""  herbs of some sort and two kinds of cheese.  It came with a  salad of mixed greens and cherry tomatoes.  I had to take the salad even though I don't \""""ever\"""" have salad for breakfast.  I moved the salad to one side and licked off the fork .... The best tasting dressing I had tasted in years.  So I finished off the salad (that I never eat) and dug into the eggs ... Yum Yum Yum, I now have a new favorite breakfast dish.  You want a Mimosa to go with the meal?  Order  up.  We are going back this Sunday with our friends and I would highly recommend it to everyone.  A couple at another table told us that if we thought that the Brunch was good, we should come in for dinner as those meals were out of this world.  Oh .... by 9:45AM every seat in the restaurant was occupied.",1
This place has the best wednesdays in the valley! I love all of their bruschettas! I will always love this place!,1
"Great atmosphere and even better food. Order bruschetta (obviously) and make sure you get at least one prosciutto and fig in your flight! The Italian Picnic salad is amazing- goat cheese... bacon... I mean what more could you want?! The only downside is you're almost forced to use valet parking. Pretty annoying but hey, what can you do? Carry a couple bucks on you for the valet.",1
Great neighborhood joint can't beat the bruschetta and a cold brew to relax and unwind.,1
"LOVE this place. The food is always fantastic! Try the bruschetta board for sure, and usually the seasonal option is great. We went there last night and the service is simply amazing. My water was full the entire time I was there and the food came out very quickly. We arrived around 6pm and they were decently busy, but we didn't wait for a table which is nice. We have been to the Monday/Tuesday 8pm special before and that gets extremely busy. Make sure you arrive a little before 8 and you will probably wait a bit for a table but it's worth it! A board of bruschetta and a bottle of wine for $20... can't beat that anywhere! Maybe one of the best aspects of this restaurant is that they do not upcharge bottles of wine 90% like many others do. The bottle is 3x the glass price, pretty great if you ask me!",1
"Stopped by when they first opened and wasn't very impressed. I'll admit I haven't been back for a second try, but here is the first experience:\n\nIt wasn't crowded and service was extremely slow, staff seemed to be more interested in their own conversations than serving guests. Food was okay, nothing fantastic, portions were small and price was large. \n\nI'm not quite sure what all the hype has been about this place, but I might give it one more try before I totally write it off.",0
"Refreshing change from Scottsdale prices, over-the-top complexity and congestion. \n\n\u00dcber simple, almost plain-Jane, decor is misleading. Nice wine list, tho light on French wines. Nice beer list. \n\nMix and match menu with reasonable prices complementary valet parking. \n\nAND, $5 wine before 5 PM each day. \n\nI'd be inclined to try their weekend brunch it time permits some trip. \n\nI'll come back for sure.",1
"I went here with my girlfriends on a weekday at lunch time, and we were seated right away. The wine recommendations were excellent, and the food was great. I ordered the tomato and mozzarella as an entree, and it was delicious. My friends ordered a variety of food from salads to sandwiches, and we were all impressed. Great experience!",1
Only missing a star because of parking. The food (esp. the bruschetta) is excellent!,1
"My first dinner in Phoenix turned out to be a very good one thanks to Postino Arcadia. \n\nIt's classy yet casual, good for dinner (if you're more of a snack person) and relaxed despite the more dressy ambience. \n\nEach bruschetta used what tasted like locally sourced seasonal vegetables. I especially loved the Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomatoes bruschetta (of course, you can never go wrong with BURRATA!). \n\nThe waiter also made an excellent recommendation for beer (dark beer lover speaking). I forget the name but ask for the darkest beer and you won't be disappointed. \n\nOverall, a refreshing first time dining experience in Phoenix!",1
"I really enjoyed this place, and my expectations were moderately high since this wine bar is considered Yelp's 100 best places to eat.\n\nI came solo and had a leisurely lunch where I wanted to order both a selection of bruschetta and half-sandwich and salad combo, but upon the waiter's recommendation I just sampled one of the bruschetta - the warm artichoke spread, which was incredible, though I gotta admit it didn't come out that warm.  It tasted like it had been sitting in the kitchen for a while before waitstaff had gotten around to picking it up and delivering it to me. Ultimately it came out kind of cold, but it was still incredibly good, so I can't complain too much (except I can because I'm Korean like that and prefer it when my food is hot off the fire hot and my drinks are icy cold).\n\nI also had a glass of white wine which was completely forgettable, Hannah's field salad, and 1/2 Tuscan Tuna Sandwich.  I don't typically go for tuna sandwiches, but it sounded perfect, and the pickles and the mustard added just the right hint of piquancy.  The salad was nice too, though a little sweet for my tastes; all in all, it paired nicely with the tuna sandwich.  I love the kale and quinoa combo.  \n\nThis is a fun place to come with friends, so that you can share all of the different types of bruschetta.  If I came back and didn't order anything but a few different bruschetta, I wouldn't feel like I missed out. :)",1
"It has a nice place that I can recommend to my friends who needs to drink and to unwind. To eat and to relax. The food is good. Personally, I love Autostrada Panini.",1
"I doubt there is much else I can say about this place that hasn't been said. It is an easy place to love; the bruschetta, the salads, the wine, the service...it seems that they really have perfected it. Anytime this place comes up in a conversation on whether or not to go, my answer will always be Yes, Yes, YES!!!",1
My favorite place!!  Bruschetta is amazing and I love the Italian Picnic salad.  Service is always great.,1
"I enjoyed this place! My husband and I met another couple here for dinner. We got 4 types of bruschetta- the seasonal, goat cheese with peppers, one with prosciutto, figs, and marscapone, and Brie apple and fig. All 4 were amazing!! I ordered a salad and the broccoli cheese soup. They were both good, but overshadowed by the amazing bruschetta. They had a very nice wine and beer selection. We saw on the patio under a heater and that made for a very nice ambiance. It took me a bit to catch on that we didn't have just one server, but that all the servers help all the tables. All in all- I would definitely go back!",1
"I've been eating at Chuy's for years - ever since my college days in Tucson. This place is cheap and cheerful - what more could you want? The food is good (I love the California Taco's), the margarita's are fabulous (I love the strawberry one's and the regular one's are so strong they make me sweat!) and it's pretty family friendly. They have great happy hour specials during the week and a full bar.\n\nYou can feed 2 people for under $20 bucks and that includes a pitcher or beer AND margarita's. They have free chips, a salsa bar, and an ice cream dispensing machine to boot.\n\nI've used Chuy's to cater corporate lunches before and it's a great deal if you need a lot of food to feed a group with a small budget. The only problem I've ever had with catering is that they forgot to give me my guacamole 3 times in a row...so check your catering order before you leave to make sure you have everything.",1
"Chuy's is one of those places that doesn't quite qualify as a dive bar/restaurant, but is close enough to count.  I like Chuy's.  It's like a mini-vacation every time you go.  Part beach bar, part pseudo-tiki (any place that has thatch palm fronds above the bar gets a star in my book!), you'll feel like you're on a beach somewhere every time you visit.  \nIt's nice to have one within walking distance to the office, to allow for a little exercise to and from and still have a good meal.  Their prices are reasonable.  I've been struggling to find a lunch under $10 these days, and the Tri-tip sandwich and an iced tea will set you back a ten spot and some change.  The food is good, did I mention that?  The staff is friendly, and they finally did away with the cheap-o' paper towels and put real napkin dispensers on each table...FTW!  \nThere's an unlimited chips and salsa bar, I like the cabo sauce the best for my chips.  I always add a little Baja sauce; you have to ask for it at the counter, to whatever I'm enjoying.  Today it happened to be the Tri-tip sandwich.  I give it 4 out of 5 stars because even though they have to-go cups, this is Phoenix.  It is 108* outside and the full glass of iced tea I left the restaurant with was gone by the time I got back to the office.  There should be a City-wide ordinance that all restaurants must supply patrons with at least a 32 oz. to-go cup during working hours.  All right, I confess that might be a little much.  The only down-side to Chuy's at lunch I've found so far is having to go back to work afterwards and not being able to enjoy a Corona with my lunch.  That's okay though, it just one more reason to go back.",1
"I had the California tacos. The salsa was really good, but the tacos were sub-par. There are too many other good restaurants in the area to waste your time here.",0
"Update MAY 5 2011:\nOH CHUY'S, HOW I WILL MISS THEE!!\nUnfortunately for society as a whole, Chuy's didn't pay the rent and they've been closed down.  I tried to go 2 days ago and there's a sign on the door talking about a Landlord's Lien for non-payment of rent.\n\nOh well, time to head to Two Hippies instead. They do nice Taco's too.\n\n------------------\nCheap Eats, Free Chips and Salsa, good $2 margheritas all day and night!  Did I mention cheap? My wife and I can usually eat well and both have a drink or two for less than $20 including a tip during happy hour.\n\nI love this place - This is how a chain should be! Tasty food, feels local even though it's not and a staff that takes care of you without ever being in your face.\nMy heart has fallen hard for the broiled mesquite fish Tacos, or the chicken tacos. The broiled fish tacos are the best I've had anywhere. I generally stay away from the steak dishes because they aren't as good but I don't hold that against them. It's just that Baja California food is best served as fish or chicken, 'nuff said.\nHere's a tip - If you don't like the rice they serve on a combo plate then you can usually substitute in an extra protion of beans or cabbage salad instead to keep it low carb.",1
"Awesome meals, especially for the price. I was raving about that the entire meal. And I think I was a fan of the margaritas. I really couldn't remember or drive home.",1
"My husband on I stopped in based on other yelp reviews and ordered a pitcher of margaritas. I am not typically a margarita fan, but these were delicious. My husband said that weren't too strong, but the flavor and price were excellent. I ordered the broiled mahi tacos and we shared the tri tip tacos. The flavor of the mahi was outstanding and the tri tip used in the tacos was tender and flavorful. The employees were also very friendly and attentive. We will definitely be visiting again.",1
"I had a mixed experience at this Banfield, and wouldn't recommend them as your first choice for a vet due to their total lack of aftercare.\n\nMy cat had (and still has) a urinary tract infection. I took him in as soon as I noticed symptoms, and was willing to do whatever it would take to make sure he gets well again. Banfield was very nearby, and they have convenient hours, open all day on the weekend.\n\nThey booked my apointment, and got me in in a few hours. The visit started with them taking my cats vitals, then playing a video about their health insurance plans while I waited for the doctor. I figured what can you do (about the advertising), it was a weekend and they got me in quickly when I called after the vet that had been recommended to me didn't have openings for days.\n\nThe doctor examined my cat, and came up with an expensive, but necessary treatment plan. Scans to see if there were stones or blockage (fortunately no) Bloodwork to figure out if he's got kidney problems or diabetes (fortunately no), and urinalysis to determine if there's an infection (yes, elevated white blood cells detected). They convinced me to leave him there all day so that they could collect a urine sample. I wandered why they didn't just use a catheter, but went with their recommendation. When I picked him up, the doctor was very friendly, talked to me about how to take care of my cat, and how to give him the prescribed antibiotics. She said \""""let us know how he's doing.\"""" A sentence that feels like a lie at this point. And I dropped over $500.\n\nOn the drive home, my cat howled in pain, and when I got home I found out he had completely wet himself. When we got home he acted much sicker than when I took him in. I called them the next day and expressed my concerns about him acting sick and asked for advice about my cat not eating. The answer from the receptionist was if I'm concerned bring him back in. No consultation, no one would talk to me, just give us more money. At least that's what it felt like. The doctor wouldn't come to the phone, and the receptionist told me, and I quote, \""""do what you want.\""""\n\nLater that night my cat started improving, and was back to normal within a week. But it didn't last.\n\nThe morning before last the infection was back. So yesterday, I went into Banfield and told the receptionist \""""I'd like to talk to someone about possibly another round of antibiotics for my cat.\"""" Once again the doctor wouldn't talk to me. The girl at the front desk just went in then back, then came out and said \""""it's been a month, we'd have to see him again.\"""" It had been less than three weeks, but okay. I told her I'm pretty broke, and she just sat there with an infuriating leave me alone look on her face. I walked in wanting to talk about treatment options and looking for advice to decide what I could afford, and left so upset and frustrated with the situation that I'll never give Banfield my business again.",0
"I scheduled a surgery for my dog to have some cysts removed. I was very worried as she is up there in age...to the point where I had to take work off. We arrived at the facility ahead of our appointment time. Nobody greated us or signed us in for over a half hour. Finally, once someone was at the desk, they said they have been trying to call me to reschedule as the vet in that day was a sub and not capable of performing the surgery. My phone was in my purse on silent as to be polite. I had called everyday that week prior basically to comfort my nerves and to find out what I should expect. Brittany is who I spoke with every time. She was nice but could provide no information. She said she would have the vet call me to answer my questions which never happened. I had no idea about cost. Will my pet be able to come home with me that day? Do you need bloodwork, etc? She said I would find all that out that day of the surgery. Unacceptable! Finally I get in with the vet. What a piece of work!!! She would not even touch my dog. Said her skin is disgusting and she smells. What vet in the world speaks about a pet as if it were an object? And to not even touch my dog??? Unreal!!! I will not be returning to ANY Banfield...EVER!!! Very sad considering I have been a customer for 10+ years. Guess your faculity is only good for vaccines. ABSOLUTELY nothing major. Oh and one last thing: the vet actually told me my dog would die on the table due to her heart murmur. I have since been to a REAL vet who confirmed this is not even true.",0
"Since my dog was a puppy, I took him here periodically for his shots and other services covered under the wellness plan. I had him on the wellness plan for about two years. The veterinary assistants were very friendly. They would try to upsell additional services not covered on the wellness plan, but would leave me alone after I would decline them. The vets, however, can be really pushy. So much that I would dread having to talk to them during every visit. I would give in sometimes just to get out of there. One vet kept on hammering me about getting my dog heart worm medication (it's preventative. My dog doesn't have heart worms, but I did give in and buy them before). I told him no thanks. He then started to guilt trip me about how my dog could die because I didn't want to pay fifty dollars for some pills. He stressed how important these pills are for my dogs survival. I then countered with \""""Well, if these pills are so important why aren't they included in the wellness plan like his rabies shots, deworming, etc.?\"""" He then shut up. Incidents like this would happen during every visit. Two different vets told me I needed to get my dog anti tartar solution to put in his water. He's a young dog and has healthy teeth! He gets his teeth brushed at the groomers! There is one Vet there who isn't a high pressure car salesman. Dr. Rice was the only vet I liked. He was very thorough and friendly. He even checked my dog's spine. No other vet did that. He told me I should get some ear cleaning solution. I asked him if the cheaper stuff on the shelves is just as good as the prescribed expensive stuff and he was honest with me. Dr. Rice was great and genuinely seemed to care. Sadly, he only saw my dog once and the receptionist said I could not request a specific vet for my visits. So, I ended my wellness plan and never returned. I don't like feeling like I'm walking onto a used car lot when I go to get my pet his check up. No thanks, Banfield.",0
"I took my cat  to this hospital because he developed sudden symptoms that required that I see a Vet ASAP! The Vet determined that he was constipated after a pricey X-ray and told me to give him Miralax. The next day found my cat not eating and still not using the litter box. I went to the same Vet and she gave my cat an enema and sent me home with two pages of reading on Megacolon. By this time I had spent around five hundred dollars. This Vet was going to Canada for the holidays and told me if I had any more problems with my cat that one of the other Vet's would see him. She also wanted me to make a future appointment to discuss keeping my cat on laxatives for the rest of his life.  My cat was getting progressively sicker so I called on the Friday after Thanksgiving to try and see another Vet and was told that there was nothing else they could do for my cat and to take him to an emergency pet hospital.  Really, I had spent a lot of money for nothing.\n\nI found a Cat clinic in Scottsdale that saw my cat that day. The Vet could tell on examination that my cat had an anal sac infection without the X-rays because Banfield would not send them to her. My Vet took care of the problem and sent me home with some medication and two weeks later you would not know that my cat had been sick! \n\nI will never go to a Banfield Pet Hospital again! The Vet never even called to see how my cat was doing!  A very expensive lesson to learn!",0
"I have never needed to go to a heart specialist before, but all I can say is that i'm VERY impressed with the warmth I have received by the staff and doctors here, especially considering how busy they are.  The waiting room may be packed, but you still receive a friendly smile, and you still see your doctor at the scheduled time.  I needed an Echo done of my heart, and all the staff were very personable, and down to earth.  Dr. Cherukuri was my specialist, and I have not met a doctor who was so humble and kind in a VERY LONG time.  I recommend this place to anyone.",1
"Outstanding team of cardiologists here at Biltmore Cardiology! \n\nI had been experiencing some intense chest/breast pain out of nowhere. You know, just sitting on your couch, laying in bed, sitting at your desk.\n\nPretty scary when you're a youngin like me. Heck, anyone of any age, but you get the idea.\n\nMy Mom has fibrocystic breast condition (easily managed when you dial back on your caffeine consumption or eliminate it all together, no fun), and told me to hit up my OB GYN to make sure there weren't any suspicious lumps. \n\nWell, clearly a mother always knows what's up. \n\nOB GYN was almost positive the chest pain I was experiencing was related to that amazeballs fibrocystic breast condition (aww, thanks for sharing, Mom). But, as an elite level athlete, she didn't want to take any chances. \n\nOut of the office with a referral in hand to Biltmore Cardiology. Boo ... But better safe than sorry. \n\nSaw Dr. Akil Loli and Dr. Harris on my first visit. Teenage like blood pressure, normal EKG, heart sounded great. He also said some of my chest pain could be related to all the torso twisting involved with hammer throw. \n\nCaring, compassionate, respectful specialist, and very easy to talk to. He gets major points for knowing what my sport is. Usually I have to explain it as Track and Field / Hammer throwing isn't too popular in the United States.\n\nDr. Loli still wanted to go forth with an echocardiogram and stress test because of my lifestyle. Nothing like only making it to Stage 6/7 on the treadmill to make you feel like a fat athlete, no?! \n\nFront desk ladies and the testing team were stellar! \n\nHad Dr. Loli's partner, Dr. Gordon (retired, but occasionally covers for the practice) review my results. Clean as a whistle. \n\nWhat a relief!\n\nI hope I never have the need to see a cardiologist again. But if I do, I know I'm in good hands with anyone here. \n\nHighly recommended.",1
"This place is old school.  That's good, because it doesn't make me want to spend more money than I have to.  It reminds me of the A&P store I worked at 26 years ago.  \n\nThe deli has a good selection of meats and cheeses, sliced to order, and the service in the deli was very friendly (Christine ?maybe??).\n\nThe lines are ridiculous.  I only shopped here twice and both times the wait was just stupid.  The second time was particularly annoying because I was buying one item and the self-serve checkout wasn't accepting my card (for $1.50), and so I had to go to the regular cashier.  They had NO express lanes, so I had to get behind people doing their shop for the week.  And the few lanes they had open each had at least 4 people in them.  Very frustrating.  Glad I don't have to shop here again.",0
"This is by far the worst frys I have ever been in. I am a pretty dedicated frys shopper, however, this frys is gross and dirty. The checkout lines are always out of control long and getting through the parking lot without getting hit by a car or cart rolling by, is a miracle. Though it is my \""""home\"""" frys I will drive 4 miles out of my way to go to a different one.",0
What can I say other than it's close to my house and they have some essentials I need.  \n\nThe store is ghetto and the meat/seafood counter selection is just as bad.  \n\nThe deli is the saving grace here as they have a huge boars head selection sliced to order and great cheese.\n\nThe checkout lines are always a wait.,0
"They close all the checkout lanes every night around 10pm and force everyone to use self-checkout. Some people aren't really bright enough to use these and the lines get very long. The place is dirty and the Target in the same shopping center is a much better choice, and Target has grocery now.",0
"This Fry's on Thomas has recently undergone a makeover, similar to the Fry's on 61 Street and Thomas. It's a big improvement, thank goodness. Now they need new, plastic shopping carts that don't squeak and restrooms that don't creep me out. Seat covers would be a start, pick up all the toilet paper from the floors...and wash all of the germs off everywhere!!  \n\nThere's a cute little Starbuck's inside to the right and a seating area with free wi-fi.\n\nI always stop by the olive bar on my way to the deli 'cuz I love green olives.\n\nThe checkout lines are too long for my taste. Frequently there is only one cashier open that isn't for express checkout. Last time I shopped I chose to do the self-checkout rather than wait in the long line. I had way too many items to warrant self- check out, though and probably won't put myself through that ordeal.",1
"Yelp keeps bugging me to write this review, so here goes....\n\nThis Fry's has recently undergone an extensive and well needed remodel. It looks much cleaner than it used to, but it's still a rather shady place to shop. The bathroom was absolutely disgusting! I told customer service and they said they would send someone. I have no clue whether or not they ever sent anyone to clean the bathroom, but I sure hope so!\n\nOn my last trip there, some guy was walking around the parking lot begging for spare change so he could eat. I gave him the three quarters I had in my middle console. He thanked me, walked away and returned to my car window a few seconds later. Just as I was thinking he was greedy and back for more change, he knocked on my window with a bluetooth in his hand. It was mine! I had dropped it out of my purse when I was putting groceries away. I thanked him and immediately thought about my guardian angel. There was a reason that guy was in the parking lot.\n\nI had a difficult time finding things because they have moved products around in the remodel. I walked up and down the aisles twice looking for popcorn and finally found it. The checkout lines were long, but the store was packed so that was to be expected.  Luckily there were many cashiers available and several self-check out registers.",0
"Okay, I've been back more than once and while I can't say I've fallen in love, I've certainly developed a little crush on the Fry's Food Store.  I visit Phoenix once every year and stay at a local hotel that has a microwave and refrigerator in every room.  I choose this Fry's to stock up on healthy food, both meals and snacks, while I'm here.  \n\nThe produce is fresh and colorful, there is a wide variety of it available and it is attractively displayed.\n\nI stocked up on meat, cheese, soup, microwave meals, I was all over the store and every aisle was clean and well stocked with everything I needed to sooth all my hunger cravings.\n\nI'm upgrading this store's rating to four stars and I believe they have earned it.",1
"I went to this Fry's on Friday the 1/24/14 and I was there to pick up 2 veggie trays for a party at work. I picked up 2 veggie trays and fruit juice poured out all over my slacks and I was upset. I asked to speak to a manager. Now remember I said veggie tray not fruit tray, so when I explained this to a manager who finally arrived he said he was not sure why that happened and was going to find out what and how it happened. So in the mean time Jerry Cruz the manager wanted to know what he could do for me, and I suggested he pay my cleaning bill but instead he offered to purchase the different trays I decided to buy. Thank you Jerry for making it right for me.",1
"This place is the dive bar of grocery stores. Congrats Fry's! You popped my 1-star cherry.\n\nIt is only due to my current boycott of Target that I brought my business to the Fry's next door. This decision was based on principal, but I have to say I have missed Target.  \n\nWhen I walk through the front doors I just feel miserable. The 'energy-saving' automatic lights make me seize. The narrow aisles make me claustrophobic. The overall dinginess consumes me. I'm suddenly overwhelmed with an anxious feeling similar to when I brought a bad report card back to my parents. Or when I had to confront an ex-gf's parents about why the Pennsylvania State Troopers were calling them at 4am. \n\nMy pace quickens. My pupils dilate. The lump in my throat expands. I try to gasp for air, but the weight on my chest suffocates me. I feel lethal; on the verge of frenzy. My mask of sanity is about to slip. Sweat beads down my back. My aggressiveness becomes visible. The curmudgeon at the self-checkout grunts at me. Darkness comes over me...\n\nI reemerge 36 hours later with no semblance of reality. Fry's is a catalyst of my psychosis.",0
"This Fry's is just around the corner from my home. Unless I'm taking my husband's grandma shopping (who also lives right around the corner) here, I avoid this place at all possible! I much rather drive a couple miles to another Fry's. What really turns me off is the clientele and it just feels... dirty.",0
"Im not sure what store Ana S (below me) was shopping at but this store does not have a Starbucks and is not deserving of anything more than 2 stars...and the 2nd star is mainly due to its location to where i live. I have pulled up and seen homeless guys sleeping towards the east end of the building. More than once i have been approached in the parking lot for spare change. The security guards i have seen look  like they just were dropped off the short bus. Now lets go inside! It seems as though this store is not as well stocked as the two stores closest to it. The deli staff is either retarded or trained to be rude and stupid. The whole feel of the store is \""""dont touch that it looks sticky\"""". If i need something quick it is the obvious choice....otherwise i drive the extra couple of miles to go to the one on Camelback and the 51.",0
"There's always parents @ this Frys, who make  their kids scream &cry. I shop here, ONLY cuz it's close & cheap.    Within the past 2weeks, I got hired @ this Kroger Store (didn't even work--& got fired! cuz I have Epilepsy)  ...A few Thursdays ago, I got told by hiring manager, Holly,  \""""we have ur new-hire-paperwork, u start training Sun&Monday!\"""".

The Colorado-\""""doctor\"""" told me, I might not get hired by Frys, cuz they don't hire people w/this medical prescription!!  On Tuesday I still had No call back from Frys (eventho I was supposed to have worked Sun & Mon). I went to Frys & asked Holly, \""""Oh, I don't have a job? Why didn't u call me?\"""".  Holly, kept saying that I didn't pass some form of screening test.  How come this hiring manager said I WAS HIRED?!",0
Ehhh I don't really like this place.,0
Horrible customer service. They always sigh heavy and act like anything you need is a burden. Great prices but if you have time go to a different location.,0
"Kroger: ruining Frys one transaction at a time. \n\nToday's visit started with a coffee from the deli.  After Jeffrey took my money, I discovered there was only powdered whitener. \""""No problem,\"""" I say, \""""it's a supermarket, there's cream in the store.\""""  \""""No, I can't go and get cream from the dairy department,\"""" says he, \""""it has to come from the warehouse.\"""" \""""May I have my money back?\"""" I ask.  \""""No, I'm not authorized to give your money back,\"""" says he.  \""""Here's your receipt.  You'll have to go to Customer Service.\""""\n\nOn my way to customer service, I stop at the dairy case for an 88\u00a2 carton of milk, believing that Customer Service will see the logic of placing said carton at the Deli counter.  Along the way I am \""""greeted\"""" by Kelly, the Store manager.  I explain my strategy for customer service.  \""""We can't do that,\"""" he says of the milk, \""""it ends up going bad.\""""  Why is there no cream; why can't the clerk make refunds? I wonder aloud.  \""""There's a problem with the warehouse; ever since Kroeger took charge,\"""" seemed to be the mumbled response. \n\nMoral: fry's shoppers be wary--make sure your order is correct before giving over your money.  Or consider Basha's.",0
"I really enjoy birthday cakes and I have to say that Fry's can make a good cake. In fact, when put in front of me next to a similar cake from AJ's, I cannot tell a difference (since I am not a spring chicken anymore, I have had many cakes from both places, although I do love AJ's).  \n\nMy mother recently purchased two cakes from Fry's: a black forest cake and a Napoleon cake in honor of my birthday.  During the birthday song, I plucked off some blackberries from one of the cakes (hush, it was my birthday!). When the lights came on, I was a bit horrified to see that the remaining berries were covered in white fuzz.  I am very very certain that this fuzz was not sugar, but MOLD.\n\nIf you are going to sell a cake topped with fruit, it is very important to use FRESH fruit, or just abandon the concept and put chocolate on the cake instead. I mean, it is a cake, not a tart, and everyone likes chocolate. Or, how about a fruit-shaped cookie or fondant molded into the shape of a strawberry?   \n\nNeedless to say, I survived eating the moldy berries, and apparently the taste was well-masked by super sweet frosting. But Fry's Bakery, please take note of this because putting moldy fruit on your otherwise pretty cake is sinful, disgusting, sad and offensive.",0
Overcrowded market. Nothing worth a crap. Overpriced with no real selection. \nDirty as well.,0
"NOT happy. I spoke with Christy on the phone and she was rude and unaccommodating. She required that i drop my animal off at 7am but could not tell me when i would need to pick her up. She also informed me that she did not accept appointments because \""""she doesn't know what her day will look like\"""" and that she \""""goes home whenever she wants\"""" - clearly working is not her priority. \n\nI scheduled an appointment at another groomer in the area. I truly worry how my animal will be treated since I was treated so horribly over the phone.",0
"It would take a lot of mojitos and sangria to get me back to Havana Cafe anytime soon. Is the food bad? No. But Cuban food is a bit bland on my taste buds next to other foreign cuisines The San Juan Platter I had was kind of plain, and only a garlic sauce gave some of the items any taste at all. The pollo cubano was pretty much chicken soaked in lime juice and buried in sauteed onions. \n\nBut those mojitos and sangria are definitely tasty, and the waiting staff is excellent. It seemed, though, a woman I guess was the owner thought a Saturday night would be a great time to conduct a rather loud discussion about marketing and operations for Havana Cafe. That sliced into the already dull atmosphere. \n\nAnother complaint: Why does Havana Cafe feel the need to take up its entire front parking lot with valet parking? I'm neither too lazy to walk, not do I enjoy having strangers drive my vehicle. For a parking lot so small in a climate so mild, valet parking is just stupid. \n\nReally, if I want a fairly fancy Latin-flavored meal, I'll just head over to Asi es la Vida or Mucho Gusto Taqueria. Both restaurants are a lot more inventive, interesting and memorable.",0
"A party of four entered a small \""""Cuban Cafe\"""" settled in between a dying strip mall. The wait service was below average. The mojitos were above average. The seafood was cooked well. But was it extremely memorable? No.\n\nThe dessert sampler were pretty good for the price. But if I was in Arizona again, I'd pass on this place.",0
"Firstly, this is Arizona turn the air conditiioning on! Normally I am not big on atmosphere, but when its 80 degrees plus outside, I expect a comfortable temperature. I had to sit outside since the inside was stuffy, and the black curtains did not do my comfort level any justice. \n\nNow that I am done ranting a bit, lets get on to the food. At this point, unfortunately, it does not get any better. We ordered the Pasteles, a tamale with pork, plantains, raisins, and spices, for an appetizer, and it was not that great. The masa was a bit dry, and the flavors weren't as scintillating as I expected, especially for the price. \n\nFor our entrees we had the Ropa Veija (shredded beef in spices with black beans and rice), which once again was not anything spectacular. This was the highlight of the meal, which to me is sad. The beef was a bit tough and the moros (rice and black beans mixed) was dry. Sadly, our other entree was much worse. This title is held by the Pollo Cubano (marinated chicken breast with onions). The chicken was tender on the bright side, but it was covered with onions that were disgustingly soaked in lime. The flavor was overwhelming and I could taste nothing other than lime. \n\nConsidering the price, atmosphere, and quality of Havana Cafe's food I will never return. If you must try this restaurant, I ask you to please not order the items mentioned above.",0
"What more can I say that the other reviewers haven't already said? Havana Cafe is fantastic! I believe I may have been Cuban in a former life because I absolutely love the flavors of Cuban cooking. And, going to this restaurant somehow makes me feel like I'm right at home. The food is comforting to me -- delicious black beans & rice, unbelievably tasty maduros fritos and wonderfully scrumptious pollo cubano and chicharrones de pollo!\n\nThe atmosphere is great too.  You feel like you've escaped the desert and been transported to a cool tropical Caribbean hideaway. It's very laid back, low-key and unstuffy, yet they offer a very inviting and classy dinning experience. \n\nTheir lunch menu is much more affordable than their dinner one, but even then the prices are decent for an awesome meal with great atmosphere. Havana Cafe will always be my favorite place to go for great Caribbean cuisine.",1
"One of my favorite things to do is go hike the echo canyon side of camelback and then cruise down the hill to Havana Cafe. The best mojito in Phoenix hands down no arguments please! The black bean fritters, o my holy ****! So good! Everything on the menu here is very well done. I have a good amount of Cuban food and this is one of my all time favorite spots. Good ethnic food is hard to come by in the Southwest and this place sets a good example. Heads up ladies, This place is full of Latin charm so go with your girls and your drinks will be nice and strong!",1
"I really wanted to like this place.  The people were friendly and the service was good, but the food was bland.  Pretty small and dark inside the bar area was practically noexistent.  Nevertheless, had to try the mojito.  So-so and have had better.  Also, the food looked and tasted like cafeteria food.  If you've ever eaten in Miami or S. Florida you will sorely be disappointed with the selections here.  I left questioning whether I went on an off-night.",0
"I go here all the time and I love it!  Such great ambiance for such a little place, always cozy and fun to stop in here for a bite.  The tapas are all perfectly spicy or fruity or whatever they want them to be - I usually order a variety every time I go.  The ceviche is great on hot days.  Also a big fan of the repollo relleno.  The desserts are awesome as well, especially the guava empanadas (just let them cool down before you bit into them!).  I don't usually order the meals, but when I have, they have been very good.  I am definitely more a fan of just ordering a bunch of tapas.  Also, great mojitos and sangria!  Very cute and pleasant place.  Great service, very friendly people.",1
"Haven't been to the Havana Cafe in years.  Forgot all about it until a friend suggested that we have lunch there.  The service was great and so was the food.  Can't remember what the name of the entree was that I ordered, but it was spicy shredded beef with  two skewers of grilled zucchini and mushrooms and plantains as well .... all very good!  \n\nI will put Havana Cafe on the rotation of lunch time spots!",1
"This is w/out a doubt the worst food I've had since I've been living in Phoenix.\nI gave it 2 stars, because the service was great, although the constant refilling of my water was getting a bit annoying. The food is not authentic, I had the Puerto Rican combo, which none of the food on there was even worth eating, while the hubby ate some traditional Cuban food, which was traditional tasting. \n\nWont be going here or recommending this place to anyone, unless they're thirsty.",0
"I am hesitant to write this review seeing all the glorious write ups before me. I came for lunch today and was very disappointed. I ordered the tapas trio and 30 minutes later the server came over to tell me they were out of the sauce for the meatballs and the chef did not want to make a substitution. Not a big deal, but 30 minutes was quite a while to wait to be told to order something else. \n\nOn the servers suggestion I ordered the pollo cubano, it came out very, very dry. It was covered in a citrus sauce that was decent, but even with the sauce and marinated onions on top the chicken was barely edible. \nMy friend ordered Arroz con Pollo and the chicken was just as dry, I didn't taste any chorizo and the asparagus was overcooked to a mush.\nThe sangria was pretty good and had a subtle rose taste.. I'd return just for it.\n\nLike I said with so many good reviews perhaps this was just an off day. I'll certainly go back and give them another try, hopefully with an updated review to follow.",0
"I have been here a couple of times and just not written a review for this location. \n\nLast time was great everything we ordered was delicious and fresh, this time not so much, at least as my food was concerned. \n\nOn a recent rip to California I visited a Cuban bakery and cafe where I had the most amazing potato balls, that's what they call them there, a mashed potato croquet slightly larger than a golf ball, filled with seasoned ground beef and flash fried and Oh SO Amazing and only .80cents each! WHAT! ;-) \n\nSo when I saw Christina's review describing these fabulous treats I wondered how I over looked them and decided to make my way over to Havana. \n\nI have to say I was extremely disappointed, 2 golf ball sized, dried out potato balls for $6.50! (see pics)\nThey were not even edible in my opinion.  \nI asked the waiter to take them away.\n\nI also ordered the calamari (see pics)which I was not happy with either but since someone in my party kept eating it, it was a little hard to send back. \nIt was very heavy if that makes sense, the crust was so thick and I though it was a tad rubbery but what turned me off the most was the grayish greenish color...........I wasn't going to eat these either.",0
"I'm sadly disappointed with Havana Cafe.  I ordered the Pollo Ajillo over steamed rice with maduros.  The chicken was over-salted and had a lot of fat.  The rice tasted like something that was microwaved.  It was as if it was a frozen meal which was then plated and heavily salted. The maduros were ok.\n\nI could barely get thru a few bites and felt bad when the hostess asked if she could box up the rest for me and I had to decline.   I'm not one to turn away from salt.  In fact, I''ve been known to add more salt to my food for taste.  So when I couldn't even handle this plate of food, it came as quite a surprise.  I would give Havana Cafe one star but I had a very attentive hostess, so I give Havana 2 stars because of the kind service.",0
"Cute little restaurant, very cramped, but I feel like that is how it should be.  On a hot day, I almost feel like I am in Cuba.  They have a diverse menu, so you are sure to find something for everyone.  This doesn't seem like the ideal place to have a dinner date, but so far I have only had hits with this place.  Everyone I've taken here has loved that food and commented on how cute the restaurant is.  Mmmm...thinking about croquettes is making me crave some Havana Cafe.",1
This place is a huge dissapoinment. You look at the menu and you get excited thinking. Oh this is going to be good!!!  Then the food comes and is wrong. Very wrong. \n\nThe rice is wet and salty. Too much cilantro all over the place. This is not Mexican is Cuban. Yes we use cilantro on our food but not to that level. \n\nRice should not be soup.  Bad cooking period.,0
Its Cuban and fun.  Where else are you going to get Cuban food?,1
"This is my favorite Tapas joint in town. It's a place I have to get the same thing everytime and maybe more to try a few new items... my must haves are:\n\nIsland Gingered Yam & Pumpkin Bisque Soup (Seasonal)... so good and the fact that it's seasonal makes it even more of a special treat.\n\nCamarones Al Ajillo (Garlic Shrimp)... this is my all time favoreite dish thus far @ Havana... I can eat it as my meal as long as they provide me as much of their tasty bread as I need to sop the dish dry of all the yummy garlic sauce it contains.\n\nMaduras Fritos... Fried plantains... need I say more?\n\nMojito... best in town in terms of authenticity.\n\nMarquesas de Chocolate aka Chocolate Pate... I never cared for dessert here until I tasted this strangely named treat. It is so rich at first you think it will be too little but then you realize you need to share with everyone at your table.\n\nOther worthy options: \nArroz Con Pollo... It has baby peas in it and I really don't like peas... but I like them in this dish! I got to try this dish because a friend ordered it as his meal and didn't even make a dent in it... so I got all the leftovers and it was pretty tasty and economical!\n\nFritoras de Frijoles Negros... I've never had Black Bean Fritters before--they are quite tasty dipped in Guacamole!\n\nCalypso Chips...A thinner more chippy version of Fried Plantains.\n\nSun Spots... Sweet Potato Fritters pretty tasty as well... for a fried root vegetable!\n\nDatiles Con Chorizo... A meatier appetizer... not the best I've had but pretty darn good.\n\nEmpanaditas... These are alright... though I'm partial to Filipino style Empanadas... but since I have no place to buy them from, nor have I mastered making them, these are quite good for a band-aid craving.\n\nTamal Cubano... pretty tasty, but my fave is the soupier Salvadorean take on the chicken tamale.\n\nFlan... haven't had it, but flan consistency throughout varying cultures seems pretty consistent.\n\nFree Goodness: Their Bread! It's just the way I like it, hot, thin and crisp crust and soft in the middle!\n\nAs you can see, outside of the Arroz Con Pollo, I have not tried many of their entrees... I'm quite content to dine with others and share Havana's wonderful tapas... but one day I WILL try their Paella. A vegetarian friend said they make a veggie paella that was pretty tasty... and she loves their Mojitos just as much as I do so I think she may be right on this one. Can't wait to try it... with a side of Camarones al Ajillo and a Mojito!",1
"Great food, I can't complain other than I wanted more food....hehe!",1
"i usually get annoyed when i see people review a thai restaurant and give lower stars because neither the owners, nor customers, nor servers, nor anyone is thai. you've seen these reviews cause in my head, if the food and service are good, why should i give a shit who is serving it to me. the whole debate about authenticity is one i find annoying on several levels.\n\n. so, first, no, i am not giving them two stars cause the guy who served us was the blondest gringo (with passable though arrogant spanish) with a haircut i don't know the name for but would describe as a mini bowl cut/possibly a shelf cut. his service was SHITTY, which definitely has something to do with the low stars. and it certainly doesn't help that i had to listen to him ask the waiter in spanish, which he assumed i didnt speak, maybe 7 times if the cheesy convertible out front was ours but then i had to listen to him talk about convertibles with another table for ten minutes. that may have something to do with the star takeway.\n\ni actually could have heard the guitarist sing guantanemera 8 more times than listen to the waiter/possible owner talk about cars to the neighboring table. that is a big statement for me as my nipples usually invert for minimum 48 hours every time guantanemera is played anywhere within a 17 mile radius.\n\nthe most obvious reason for the 2 star rating is the food. it sucked shit. it did not taste that it was freshly cooked in any way. there was a film over teh meatball sauce that had to be broken several times for the moat of semi-warm liquid to emerge. everythin was severely underwhelming and lacked flavor.\nspecifically, these items, in addition to tiny meatballs in a bowl of lukewarm sauce (that the mother, bless her, was a fan of) would be...\n\nempanadita trio (we had the beef-BLAND)\n\nsome kind of black bean ball- the only reason this place didnt get one star is that the avocado dip for said BBball was tasty. this has to do with my undying love for the avocado rather than their particular dip\n\nspanish tortilla- the worst i think ive ever had, and i spent 5 years as a poor tortilla eater in spain and argentina in  between english teachin gigs when they came as free tapas.\n\nthe best thing here was probably the bread, they brought it warm.  our other favorite was some kind of cheese spinach thing that i would put more in the greek family. wasn't bad.\nall in all, this place was, mas o menos, mierda",0
"Seriously, my favorite place in the entire Valley.  Fabulous food in a casual environment.  Excellent service, great drink menu.  Every time i eat here, i rave about the food.  I usually have the Pollo Cubano.  Its simply delicious.  An entree is about $20.  And worth every penny!",1
"A Midwest girl's Cuban haven.\n\nI went here twice Valentine's Day weekend. 5 stars for the mojitos. 5 stars for the Black Bean Fritters. 5 stars for the service.\n\nVery casual, cozy environment. I'll be back here the next time I'm in town.",1
"So after driving by this place for a few years always wanting to try it out I finally did.  I am so thankful reading the yelp reviews helped my decision to finally try this place out cause it is some of the best cuban food I've ever had.  \n\nFor starters I got the calypso chips which are fried plantain chips and a black bean dip.  So awesome I could have just had that.  I also got this brazilian sugar cane drink with lime juice that was a twist on a mojito and it was awesome.  \n\nFor my entree I got the Boliche Mechado which is a Cuban pot roast stuffed with Spanish chorizo and simmered in a red wine sauce. Served with spicy potatoes which also were just excellent.  I am a huge chorizo fan so when I saw this on the menu I knew it was the choice.  \n\nI was too full for dessert so I couldn't try any of the amazing selections that were on the menu but I will be back for that for sure.  Also they have paella which I must go back for cause it had chorizo, scallops, clams, and mussles.  Sounds delicious.  \n\nThanks again yelp for another push to try a local hot spot.",1
"Okay so last night 6 of us came here for dinner. Its the 3rd time I have been to this location. The first time I thought it was AMAZING. Couldnt get enough of it. 2nd time was \""""ok\"""", my drink (Pussy's Pain Killer) tasted off, not like the first visit and the food was somewhat bland. Chalked it off to being an off night. So last night I ordered a dish I had at the Bell Rd location which was phenomenal-Gallina Fritta. Last night it was almost dry, bland, you couldnt even taste the garlic or lime. So disappointing. My Pussy's Pain Killer tasted better but not even close to the \""""wow\"""" factor the first time I had it. For this I dont think I will ever return, its far from consistent and has changed from \""""Amazing\"""" to \""""meh\"""" in 3 years time. Its time to find a new Cuban/Puerto Rican restaurant to get my fix.\n\nAs for the service..our server was extremely pleasant but scattered. He took appetizer orders from 4 of us and completely forgot to ask the other 2 at the table! Then the same 2.. their food entrees didnt even come out within 5 minutes of the rest of us.?? It is not a big restaurant and we were not a big party, so there was no reason for the service to be sub par.\n\nIn the poetic stylings of Guns -n-Roses.\"""" I used to love her...ooh yeah.. but I had to kill her\""""..is my final word on this place.",0
"Last night I introduced my friends to my fianc\u00e9. It took me a long time to decide on the perfect restaurant for us all to get together for some wonderful food and drinks. I remembered going to Havana Cafe before and enjoyed it quite a bit, so finally decided that would be the spot. Sadly, this time around it wasn't very impressive. My drinks were verrrrrry weak, my food was not flavorful or even displayed in an appetizing manner. The appetizers and dessert were good, but not amazing. I'm not sure why last night was different, but it was different enough to ensure that I probably won't return. That makes me sad.",0
"Wanted to use my Groupon, and they were closed for renovation! Not sure how long that will last, but you may want to call first if you are thinking of going soon. Will update when I can actually go!",0
"So this is heartbreaking.  I've been going to Havana cafe for years and over looked a lot as far as decor and service, but once the food goes... So do I.  A friend who used to live here, who was visiting, suggested Havana cafe for dinner since it was always great.  Our food was not good.  It was ok at BEST and our service was lack luster- snotty really.  Then they cleared our plates before we were done and started to vacuum while we were still eating. If we were the only people keeping them there late, which it was NOT LATE AT ALL (and we weren't the only patrons there)  I could understand, but overall the service was poor right out the gate and our food wasn't great, So we will not be going back, which breaks my heart. Since I've had many good experiences in the past. I always knew I was paying more, but I figured it was worth it, but I don't think $400 for 5 people was worth that kind of poor service.  ESPECIALLY since SO many places are closing up these days.",0
"If you ever tried \""""real Cuban food\"""" you will be disappointed at the lack of taste and the mundane appearance of the food. The food is overpriced, the tamales are awful, nothing like Cuban tamales at all. The local is poorly decorated,  and you need to bring a butt cushion to make your sitting experience a bit more pleasant on those plastic patio chairs. The service was below average, and one of the waitress could not find a way to smile. Really disappointing. \n\nNow the goods. Extensive menu, with many legitimate named cuban dishes, may be you will find something good, their name evokes that mysticism and curiosity we have about beautiful Havana,  and,  many people have never tried real cuban food so the restaurant will survive.",0
"I'd been craving Cuban food ever since I left Florida, and I couldn't have been more thrilled after our meal at Havana Cafe.  I wouldn't sit inside, as the atmosphere kind of sucks, but the patio was great in the recently-awesome weather.  The service was great... the waiter knew the menu inside and out, had great recommendations, and was the guy who remembers your order without a pad and somehow doesn't screw it up.\n\nSangria-Delicious\nMojitos-Same\nSeviche (spelled that way) -Ditto\nGambas y Pollo-See Above\nPumpkin Soup (seasonal)-Best I've Had\n\nThe bad - I think they are pretty over-priced for Cuban food.  Don't get me wrong, the food is great, but I don't think Cuban food should fall in the $20/plate range.  You need a key to get into the restrooms, which makes it feel kind of like a gas station.  You also get a feel that most male customers just go behind the dumpsters, not that I did that...  \n\nThis place would have been an easy 5-stars except for one thing, that totally blew the experience.  The waiter automatically added a 20% tip to the bill, on top of tax.  Ordinarily he would have earned it.  But when questioned, he said they always do that on large parties.  We were a party of 5.  He was extremely arrogant about it, saying nobody's ever questioned it.  Totally ruined the whole evening.  And of course, there was no mention of an auto-tip on the menu, go figure.  I could understand if there were 10 of us, you get it.\n\nOverall, I would be excited to go back again.  It's a great place to go if you are craving some pretty good authentic food in the valley that isn't Mexican.  Grab a $28 pitcher of sangria and/or a few mojitos, splurge on some appetizers, and go for just about anything on the menu.  Nobody in our group left disappointed, with the food at least.",1
We loved the live music and outdoor patio. Food was great. Very authentic.,1
"First time trying Cuban food, so that was fun to try something new.  Other than that, there was nothing to really rave about.  The wait staff did not seem thrilled to be there, people had little kids acting up in the tiny restaurant and the tables are on top of each other, so cell phone conversations took away from the experience too.  Not sure I would go again, but glad we finally gave it a try.",0
"This Havana Cafe location fell very short of our expectations.  We were greeted and shown to a table surrounded by plastic patio chairs.  Looking around, we noticed this was part of the restaurant's decor, which seemed odd considering the price of the dishes averaged $20/plate.  We were offered a $3 mojito drink special, which was fair but poorly muddled.  For entrees we selected the Bistecs Cubanos, which was bland, and the Salmon con Salsa Papaya, which was admittedly good.  Though one dish was OK, we left the restaurant wondering what all of the hype was about.  We will not be returning to the Havana Cafe given the poor value of the meal and the less-than-notable ambiance.",0
"One word to describe this place? Cute. Another? Tasty.\n\nThe BFF and I visited Havana Cafe for the first time and hopefully not the last. We went for lunch on a Saturday so it wasn't very busy. The place is pretty small (and cute!) but there are many tables inside and out. They had festive Cuban music playing which added to the atmosphere.\n\nSince neither of us know much about Cuban food we decided to go with the tapas sampler. Perfect for two people, it was loaded with 6 of their tapas. I'll murder the names, but there were plantains, chorizo, a tamale, black bean fritters, cod fritters and one other meat item I can't remember the name of. We also got a side of Sun Chips (sweet potato fries) and a half pitcher of red sangria because that's how we ladies roll for Saturday lunch.\n\nEverything in the sampler was delicious. My favorites were the plantains, the black bean fritters and the tamale but I really did like it all. The sweet potato fries were good but I've had better. That's the only thing I probably wouldn't order again. Nothing in the sampler was spicy so it's a good option for just about anyone, except vegetarians.\n\nThe sangria was good, more wine tasting than some sangrias. i'd like to try the white sangria next time.\n\nThe service was great. Everyone was friendly and they didn't try to speed us along or anything as we took our time chatting and munching.\n\nThey have a pretty extensive menu so I'm looking forward to going back and trying a few more things next time.",1
"We have tried Havana Cafe several times as we love Cuban food (used to live in Miami). Tonight, once again we had just OK food and way over paid. \n\nMy Daughter has to eat \""""gluten free\"""" and we found out today they do NOT have a dedicated fryer.  At the table next to us the kids were eating chicken nuggets.  My Celiac peers please double check before eating here.\n\nThe Masas de Puerco was dry and I ended up with the burned part of the beans from the bottom of the pan.  The food is barely average and super expensive.  We had 2 appetizers and 2 main dishes for four of us (2 kids) with one soda and it was over $60.  Kids dishes are $9.95.",0
"Oh no oh no oh no :[ The decline of one of my favorite restaurants is upon us, which makes me very sad. This might be a bit long as I normally hold Havana Caf\u00e9 very near and dear to my heart. \n\nOver the last 4 years I have been to each of the three locations (north valley, Central and Chandler - which has since closed) and loved each. Consistently good food, drinks, and service. The past few times I have visited, I've started to see the signs of a decline in quality, but last night really sealed the deal. \n\nThe mojitos - These are what DRIVE me to the restaurant. I have long said that the mojitos at Havana Caf\u00e9 are my very favorite libations that have ever crossed my lips. Always very fresh, not too sweet, lots of mint, and perfectly strong. Last night they tasted like they came from a MIX. I do have to say that they were quite strong, so that was nice as I do enjoy a bit of a buzz, but that was about the only redeeming quality. A microscopic amount of mint, syrupy taste, and why on god's green earth were they PINK?! They were never pink before! \n\nThe food - I had my usual, the Paradise Pulled Pork. It was tasty as always! They have definitely messed with the portions though. You used to get an equal amount of pork, to the rice and bean mixture. That being said, you still get a considerable amount of food. But for $20 it stung a bit to be given the shaft on my tasty shredded swine. \n\nMy honey had the Gambas y Pollo which we really enjoyed. It was quite tasty! Yummy sauce that complimented the shrimp quite well.\n\nThe service - Really pretty bad. The man who took care of us (and the only one who was there serving) was not outright rude, but I felt like we were interrupting the bookkeeping that he was doing at the table in the corner, by coming in to eat (we were not the only people there). When my man asked him whether he liked the mojito or the caipirinha better, he made sort of a big deal of saying that in the (large amount) of years he has worked there, he has never tried either as they just don't appeal to him. An odd answer for sure, but I guess honest. He gave both of us a really crappy vibe. While we were there he actually threw something at the busboy. \n\nI have experienced this man before - and once saw him repeatedly being extremely rude to a guest on the patio over the entire course of my dinner. I don't know the whole story but it was very off-putting. That experience almost had me saying I was not going to come back to this location, but what can I say, it's always been a fav of mine. \n\nI REALLY hope this was a fluke, as I would hate to see such a previously amazing restaurant take this bad of a nose dive. \n\nI almost feel like I've lost a best friend. \n\nTL;DR - Great food. Definitely overpriced especially on account of the shrinking portions. Shitty service. POOR mojitos (which previously would knock my socks off).",0
"Never been to a place like this before, but I am a fan of Cuban food now!  I had the paradise pork (see pictures) It was a little sweeter than I had expected, but really good.  Beans and rice were spicy, but really tasty.  I also highly recommend the fried bananas!!  I could eat a whole plate of those things ... my only suggestion would be to put chocolate sauce all over them hahaha!!!  \n\nCan't wait to go back and try more.  The service was really good and friendly.   A must try if you are in the area.",1
"Craving authentic Cuban cuisine? Well I was, and with one trip to Havana Cafe I satistied my craving. With a small and basic interior, it is far from a glamourized restaurant. However, what Havana Cafe lacks in apperance it makes up for in substance. Quality of the food, authenticity of the dishes and excellent customer service are the factors that really make this place stand out for me. \n\nEverything I tasted was extremely rich and packed with flavor. I ordered the ceviche, and it was AWESOME. It left an essence of piquant limes, ripe tomatoes and crisp bell peppers lingering on my tongue. I also thoroughly enjoyed their fried plantain chips with black bean dip (you've got to try it!!!!) This place serves the real Cuban deal.\n\nThe food here isn't cheap, so plan on spending a good chunk of change on your meal. Also, I'm hoping that I just visited on an off night because the mojito I ordered tasted more like a margarita as it lacked that refreshingly crisp mojito taste. It was disappointing but I'm determined to come back here and give them another chance. That way, I'll have an excuse to check out their mojito specials on Mondays!\n\nOur server was awesome and highly attentive. The fact that they have live music is also pretty cool. Overall, this place has a lot of authentic character and that's why I'm a fan. I enjoy unique dining experiences, and Havana Cafe definitely fits that bill. So, if your looking for something different, check this place out! Your taste buds will thank you.",1
"Last night I went back to Havana Cafe with a groupon and wasn't as excited when I left.  For starters we get there and go to ask for a table and get wait time and the head of the house says it's like 20-30 min wait you sure you want to wait and we said yes that's fine and he goes ok and walks off shaking his head.  We were a little caught by surprise as that's not very professional but whatever he wasn't the cook.  So we sit down and wait and notice he is trying to get people to not wait and leave every single party that came up asking for a table as a matter of fact.  Many of us waiting have started to laugh at how horrible this guy is.  He even went as far as saying ya it's over a 30 min. wait so I wouldn't wait if I were you.  OMG really??? I hope the owner reads this and does something because if that was my restaurant I would be pissed.  \n\nAnyways on to the meal.  Laura A. and I shared the Tapas sampler which was good it comes with a Tamal Cubano which was excellent, some Chorizo and vegetables, Frituras de Frijoles, Maduros Fritos, Bacalaitos Fritos, and a couple Croquetas.  It was perfect for the two of us to share but there was a lot of fried on the plate which wasn't as much variety as we would hope for.  \n\nWe both finished the meal with coffee she got the Caf\u00e9 Cubano which was a sweet espresso and I went with the Moro Castle which had Dark rum, Bailey's and butterscotch schnapps combined with Cuban coffee it was a nice way to end the evening and enjoy with dessert which we shared a coconut flan with mango sauce.  The dessert was good not great though I am a huge flan fan and I have had better.  \n\nSo overall I would say the meal was a 3.5 but the front of the house being so rude knocked it all the way down to a 2.  Pretty sad after I had given it a 4.5 on my last trip.",0
"I have never written a review, but the food at Havana Cafe was so underwhelming (and not in the least bit good) that I feel compelled to share. \nI ordered the Pollo Ajillo which, in reality, was a pile of salt with a side of chicken and rice. I opted for Arroz con Gandules instead of white rice as it has been years since I have had this tasty Puerto Rican side. The whole thing was almost inedible... I came home and actually brushed my teeth immediately, it was so bad!  My husband had the Pollo Cubano, which was equally underwhelming and nothing that we could not make at home ourselves.  The restaurant gets an extra star for the wonderful Cafe Cubano and the extremely attentive wait staff .  I had high hopes for this place but the next time I have a craving for Cuban food, I will be heading to Sabor Cubano.",0
"Let me start by saying that I absolutely LOVED the food.  My dinner was spot on.\n\nSo why the 2 stars?\n\nQuite frankly, it was way over priced.  And I'm not talking about a few dollars too expensive.  For an average dinner, you'll be spending $25 to $30.  And while the food is tasty, the ambiance does not come close to warranting $30 per plate.",0
"I lived in Miami for many years, so I can say this was mediocre Cuban food with some authority. Not bad, but for what you got, the price was outrageous. For that kind of money, you could do some real fine dining.",0
"I really wanted to like this place. Due to poor service and overpriced entrees, they only get 2 stars. We ordered the black bean fritters with avocado dip, the pulled pork, the Cuban style steak and flan for dessert. It was just \""""ok.\"""" The food alone was at least 3 stars; however, in my opinion the price was too expensive for the quality of their food. If I'm going to pay $30 for my meal, I want to at least sit on a non-patio plastic chair. \n\nOn to the service . . . the whole time, we wished we had the other waiter. He seemed happy to work there and was so informative to his customers. Our server was more concerned about pushing us to order more food that she decided to slack on her waitressing abilities (i.e. refilling water). She would say subtle things to make us feel like we were not ordering enough, such as \""""that's it! just one dessert?,\"""" \""""any other appetizer?,\"""" \""""are you sure you don't want a sangria?\"""" These weren't said with a smile either. She was worried about her tip amount, and she should be after how she treated us. Needless to say, I would have given them 1 star but the food made up for it. \n\nI think I'll try some place else for my Cuban fix.",0
"I want to like it more, I really do.",0
"I was so looking forward to making this a restaurant that I could frequent often since I am a huge fan of Latin food. I invited my grandparents to meet me here for dinner back in March 2011. The inside of the restaurant is inviting until you realize that your chairs are those that you see at Lowe's for a backyard pool party....plastic? Come on for the prices they are asking averaging $20-35 a plate. Why plastic chairs? We started off with 4 mojitos and some appetizers. Platanos-fried plantains with garlic sauce. They were okay but found them to be more on the chewy side than crispy. We all had Ropa Vieja with potatoes and rice. I was disappointed in my main entree as it was overpriced for the quality of food that I was served. My grandparents seemed to enjoy their dishes but also were so engaged in making the evening special since it was the night before my grandmother's birthday. My bf was not impressed with his entree either. This is not real Cuban food and I can tell you this because I have a close friend who is Cuban that has cooked for me. get your passport and travel to Cuba through Canada and go have yourself some REAL Cuban cuisine not this crap that they \""""call\"""" Cuban food. It is overpriced for all that you get. it got two stars because the service was attentive and staff was friendly plus the 3 mojitos I drank were the best out of everything there!",0
"I have to say, I was very disappointed with my dining experience at Havana Cafe last night... the place smelled wonderful upon walking in and everything tasted okay (though not as fresh as I would have expected for the price), but I was thrown off-guard by the plastic chairs and frozen fishstick-resembling appetizers!\n\nThe sangria is delectable and, in the moment, I enjoyed the ceviche. However, the tapas sampler was incredibly disappointing... I've traveled throughout the Latin Caribbean and this food did not meet my expectations. \n\nMost importantly, though, I awoke in the middle of the night to horrible cramping, chills, and diarrhea that kept me up for hours. I have strong reason to believe this was food poisoning from the restaurant (given I didn't eat anything else last night) and I have every intention of pursuing a full refund.",0
The world's slowest service - do not go here if you are in a hurry. The food was a miss for me but I don't blame the restaurant - I had the Pollo Cubano and the flavor was really bright - not really my thing but maybe I just don't like Cuban flavors. I did enjoy the rice and beans on the side. The server was courteous but so sloooooooow - I don't see a reason to go back.,0
"I was hoping for so much more.  Kind of a cute looking restaurant.  Outside patio is quaint and fine.  We had the tostones which weren't as crispy as i like them and the sauce that accompanies the tostones wasn't that great.  They were already all out of the arroz con pollo by 6:30 p.m. (what?!) so I had another chicken dish.  Husband had the pulled pork.  We were not wowed by either dish.  Wasn't horrible but nothing to come back for.\nThe worst part was how all over the place the wait-staff was.  One person was like the hostess but was coming to our table throughout the night.  Another dude came and took our food order but was so creepy that i nearly lost my appetite.  Yet another person delivered our meals but again returned to the table at some point to clear a dish and then another person cleared other dishes.  We waited forever for our check, forever to pay, etc.  And although it sounds like a lot of people were coming to our table, few people actually visited us after our food arrived to see how everything was.  My husband was SO annoyed.  Definitely not a great place and not worth its money.  it's a shame because if the owners knew how badly run it was, they'd change it--very much out of a kitchen nightmares episode.",0
"I had a Groupon and went for dinner with my boyfriend last night.  This place is amazing!  We started off with the tapas sampler, and everything on it was great.  We also ordered bacon wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo, which just melted in my mouth.  For our entree, we shared a fried chicken dish--very good and actually not too heavy.  And if course, since it's a Cuban restaurant, I had mojitos.  They were delicious, and very authentic--no Bacardi!  In addition to the great food, the service was fast and friendly.  We will definitely be going back soon!",1
"We were driving down from California (on the I-10) so this place was a bit out of the way. It was worth it!! The food is superb, adequate portions, and reasonable prices. The wait staff was cheerful and the recorded Cuban music made me want to get up and dance.\n\nOne tip: It seems that Cubans love things deep fried. Make sure to ask if the dish you are ordering is fried. We got one sampler dish that was all deep fried. The oil was fresh tasting and not overdone, but I prefer non-fried.....I should have asked.\n\nOtherwise, go there and enjoy a really good meal in a good atmosphere.",1
"Yelp alerted me that I have a review to complete, from nearly 2 years ago. \n\nI remember how I felt about this place back then, and still feel strongly about this place now. Recollections of how much I would not like to return to this place again. \n\nFind a place that serves Cuban-inspired food, or if there is a frozen aisle that does, heat it up in a microwave, transfer it onto a plate, and voila! Of course you'll remember to remove that non-microwaveable plastic film that Havana overlooked.",0
"I came to the Phoenix location for lunch through Groupon.  I ordered the beef brisket called Ropa Vieja, which was very tough and like eating strands of rope.  I could see where it got it's name \""""ropa\"""", because it is like cooked strands of rope. There was plenty of meat, but the flavor was all boiled and leached out of the meat.  It was served to me like a stew , but the beans and rice side and the ropa was swimming in a plateful of water almost to the edge of the plate.  The ropa stew had no flavor, like it was boiled in a big potful of plain water that kept getting changed.  I had to add a lot of salt., shake more and more and more salt on it.   It was very ICK to me.   I wish I ordered the cerviche instead.  I didn't think the ropa was worth it even with the Groupon discount, I would not want that dish even if it were free, unless I was starving.  I told the waitress it was very bland and asked her if it was normal to have all that water in the plate.   She said it was \""""juicey\"""", but to me, juice implies flavor, but I guess \""""juice\"""" for water is a waitress being positive and politically correct on her job.   My jaws were tired trying to chew the strands of \""""rope\"""".  She did not offer to bring me something else.  She said that was the way it was.\n\nFor dessert, I ordered the coconut mini flan with mango sauce, and that was really good!   I'd give it an A and the size was larger than the word mini implies.  \n\nSorry for such  negative review about the ropa, but I tell it like it is, and if I thought it was terrific, I'd surely say so.\n\nMaybe you will find something else on the menu to your liking, or maybe you are less discriminating than I am about tough and flavorless Ropa meat swimming in a plateful of water  (Yes, I know the difference between juice, sauce, soup, and water.).   I consider myself a great cook and I eat out a lot.  \n\nI only tried this Ropa, and it is not good enough to make me wanna give this restaurant another change at my own cost.   The waitress was very nice and attentive though, I have no complaints about her service, but she did not offer me a substitute.  I would have given it a one star, but she was a friendly and attentive waitress.",0
"I love cuban food!  And so I take every chance to eat it, so when I saw a cuban very close to our hotel in Scottsdale, I was there!  Unfortunately, the minute I walked in, I should have turned around and walked right back out again.  There was a distinct smell that wasn't clean and wasn't pleasant.  But my interest in  a good cuban meal got the better of me.  Big mistake.\n\nThe food was definitely sub-par.  I had the sampler, which included pollo cubano, ropa vieja, and masas de puerco.  Unfortunately, none of the dishes was particularly flavorful, and none were good renditions of the dish.  The pollo was bland other than an overly acidic sauce, the ropa vieja was just lacking in flavor and the vegetables and broth hadn't been blended together, and the masas weren't crispy in the least.  The whole meal was a huge let down.",0
"I had not been to this resturant in some time, now I remember why I have not been back.  The food is ok, however the atmopsphere is sub par for sure.  I had the cuban meatloaf, the meat and glazed yuca were dry, but eitable and fried bananas were obivously from a package.  The only thing great was the black beans.  \n\nFor the prices of the food, you would think you would have more then a plastic chair to sit in.  One of the people helping to serve food, I think is one of the managers, actually needs a class on how to serve, sorry grasping my glass by the rim is not a proper way to serve a drink.  Also you need to wash your hands before serving food after counting money.  The cleaning bottle for the tables was on the same counter as the serving counter/mixing area for drinks.\n\nThey really need a refresher course on food handling.  Possibily over due for a health inspection too.  I was very disappointed in my experienxe.",0
"Havana Cafe refused my business today when I walked into their establishment wearing a trendy bluish, turquoise singlet. Apparently, this wannabe 4-star \""""cafe\"""", that resides in a plaza for God's sakes has a clothing rule that says men have to wear sleeves, but women do not. I challenged, Keith, the waiter/proprietor, that my date was also wearing a similar sleeveless top and he proceeded to tell me that men are not allowed to wear sleeveless tops, and that if I were to eat there I would have to wear one of his awful red Hawaiian print polos with bamboo images on it that was two sizes too big! WTF?! So you'd rather offend me and require me to wear some crap Hawaiian shirt that I'm swimming in?! Mind you, it's 113 degrees out! In what world is this more \""""appropriate attire\"""" than my tank and not outright sexual discrimination? For those of you who think this is a joke, it ACTUALLY HAPPENED!",0
"This place is highly overpriced and over the top. The food was decent, yet indecently priced. If you are going to charge me $15+ for an entree, then don't seat me in a plastic chair that was procured no less than twenty years ago. Maybe it's part of the \""""charm,\"""" but I wasn't impressed, and I will not return unless the prices on the menu fall to fares that fit the flare. \n\nFor the appetizer, I ordered the beef empanadas. Having traveled to Argentina, I know a good empanada. Havana's meat filled pasty left something to be desired - not enough spice and too greasy. \n\nFor the entrees, I ordered the fried chicken and the paradise pulled pork. Both came with black beans and rice. The beans were good - blended with onions and cilantro. The rice was as plain as Jane. I found the chicken to be quite good. I liked the corn starch dusted coating and the overall flavor and moistness of the chicken. The paradise pulled pork was mediocre, at best. While the price was jacked to the max, the portion sure was not. I've had better tasting carnitas for half as much. \n\nI love when a restaurant leaves me excited to come back and try some more, and sadly Havana Cafe has not done that for me.",0
"I had passed this place when traveling back and forth on Camelback for years, and finally a groupon brought me inside. Upon first entering the restaurant I was kind of surprised how small it was, which in my book is a good thing. The walls were filled with all things cuban. However all the tables had plastic chairs, you know the kind you find outside on a patio. Very uncomfortable and extremely tacky. The menu seemed pretty good, I had the Pollo Cubano. It was chicken with black beans and rice and a lime sauce. The sauce tasted great for the 1st few bites, but after that it was overwhelmingly citric, almost to the point where I couldn't eat it anymore.  Luckily my wife has ordered another chicken dish that was salty that I could swap with to break the taste up. If they dial back the amount of lime in the dish I think it could have been much better but I would not order again. My wife's dish was rather plain, just some chicken in sherry with rice, nothing memorable.\n\nA few other things, the table tops are made of glass with no tablecloth, so when you cut your food (with a butter knife mind you, since they had no other knives) your plate slides around. Then there is the cost. I normally don't mind paying 18-25 bucks for food, but not here. The food is way, way overpriced for what you get especially considered you are sitting in plastic lawn chairs. I think honestly the food should cost no more than $10 tops, until they upgrade the dining experience.",0
"\""""My wife and I ate there a few weeks back, I thought the atmosphere was quaint and inviting however after we were sat it took quite some time before our waiter came back to us for anything. I found him to be unwelcoming and inattentive the 2 Hispanic helpers were much more courteous and attentive. The food was Ok  it wasn't horrible but i would not write home about it. It was my fist time there and maybe it was an off night but i would be reluctant to recommend the place to a friend or return simply because the service was horrible. I do how however like ambiance.",0
"If you are looking for the perfect spot for a first date, this is it!\nQuaint, romantic, and homey are a few words that come to mind.\nBut the best part for me is; you can not have a bad meal here if you tried, that being said Pollo Cubano is my favorite dish!",1
"Any Latin restaurant that uses minute rice is horrible.  Havana Cafe is one of these places.  Overpriced, rice is awful, pasteles are dry,  The one good thing is the pork.  But it doesn't warrant my going back . . . EVER",0
I just left the Havana Cafe and to say the least we were very disappointed. I have been to the Cafe months ago and enjoyed my meal immensely. I must say to be served the same 18.00 entree tonight half the size on a salad plate was a shock. \nOn the appetizer side to be served four bacon wrapped dates served on a little plate with\na dollie was a joke. It is a shame that a restaurant we visited and enjoyed just months\nago could change for the worse so quickly.,0
Black bean fritters rock and they have a couple good vegetarian options. They are always accommodating and make a good mojito. \n\nOh and when they have the pumpkin bisque ... oh lord!,1
"I was raised in Miami with a Cuban mother so I think I have enough grounds to say that if you are looking for good Cuban food...this is not the place.  The food was tasteless, not authentic and way over priced. 3 croquetas (tiny ones and def not Cuabn) were $5.50  Dinner was $63 for my wife and I. we left hungry and dissapointed. :(",0
6 of us mostly had a very enjoyable meal (one had an overly breaded/deep fried fish which didn't sit well) in celebration of a recent holiday.  Smorgasbord of an appetizer is a great idea to maybe help you make up your mind as to what to get for dinner.  Special mojitos from the bar were very worthwhile.  Owners/staff are very attentive and always seem to remember our names.,1
"AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!food is awful, place smells.  Would not recommend this place at all.\nFood is made with this lime juice and all food is covered with onions, and the black beans and rice is GROSS.",0
"I've been to Havana caf\u00e9 before, but it's been at least 5 years or so. Long enough for me to forget that this place was forgettable, in my own opinion. Take that for what it is, I don't eat much Cuban food.\n\nI was unexcited to find that Havana caf\u00e9 didn't have any spots available to park, and the rest of the open spots in the parking lot were all labeled specifically for the next door flower shop, coffee shop, and so on. What was I to do? I risked it and parked in a flower shop spot, and well, I wasn't towed, but I still felt like I was doing something wrong by parking there :-/\n\nUltimately, I was lured back with a groupon they had available a few months ago. My first mistake was expecting that I could use my groupon to pay for meals which both totaled above $30 (the value of my groupon) and ALSO ordering additional items from their HH menu. I asked for two of their mojitos and was told that I couldn't order HH since I was using a groupon also. I obliged and let them know that water was just fine. My guess is they realized I wanted to buy my drinks in addition to our meals, and the waitress came back a few minutes later and told us she would put our drink order on a separate check. Nice save on their part - I was a bit miffed at first!\n\nMy second mistake was not realizing how excessively sweet their mojito was going to be. I saw at the bottom of the glass, what appeared to be a large spoonful of sugar. In this case, it didn't help the medicine go down. After them accommodating me with the drink order and all, I didn't want to make a big to do out of this, so I soldiered my way through my drink.\n\nI ordered a shredded beef dish, and my wife a shredded/pulled pork dish. Apparently Cuban's like bell peppers and onions a heck of a lot more than I do. The peppers and onions with my dish accounted for about 3/4th's of the meal. I ate two or three slices of the peppers and a few slices of the onion, but was not satisfied with the small amount of beef the meal came with for a sticker price of $16, and even at $8 since I was paying about half with the groupon.\n\nMy third mistake was choosing to sub their house vegetables for the beans and rice. I don't eat that many carbs, so often I will exchange potatoes, fries, rice, etc for whatever vegetable is available. The waitress explained that it was a mixture of squash, zucchini, mushrooms, and a few others. In reality, it turned out to be a few slices of squash, a few slices of zucchini, a couple of mushrooms, and guess what, a bucket load of chopped bell peppers and chopped onions. They were also nice enough to charge me extra for the substitution with the meal now totaling $18 before tax and tip.\n\nTwo $6 mojito's, two $16 meals, an upcharge for the vegetables, and a $5 forgettable appetizer (I don't exactly remember what it was at this point). I was leaving with a $65 meal after tax and tip, hey, I saved $15 on the groupon though.\n\nHappy Yelping Phoenix, I hope I made it apparent how unimpressive this spot is. Maybe you prefer pan fried peppers with a bit of beef and a side of... pan fried peppers.",0
"Ah, the dreaded worst-experience of my life, horrible service, overcharged BIRTHDAY meal...that ended up in moderate-severe food poisoning.\n\nI'm talking the kind of food poisoning where at one point I desecrated the restrooms of a lovely restaurant in downtown Phoenix and ended up laying face down on the sidewalk...to where a homeless man asked me if I was ok.\n\nYeah.  It was that bad.  Food poisoning aside, it was STILL the worst meal of my life, and this WAS my favorite low-key restaurant in the valley.\n\nApparently my birthday fell on the last day of a groupon or livingsocial redemption.  Unlucky us, we paid full price (more than actually...since we were charged for the wrong items they brought out and subsequently took back), and were treated worse somehow than the coupon folks -- because it was a set menu and so the kitchen didn't want to make things not on THAT menu -- despite our paying full freaking price.\n\nFACT: When one is celebrating their birthday, they want a cocktail.  I wanted a cocktail.  Actually, I wanted three.  I got my first cocktail after I'd been there nearly an hour (oh yeah, the \""""10 minute\"""" wait I was told about was actually 40).  I didn't get a refill.  Or asked if I wanted a refill. Of that drink, or my water.  But I asked!  Oh, did I ask!   I drank my water and my dining companions.  And then eventually drank the melted ice from my un-refilled mojito. The 2 employees (great staffing job on a day you know will be busy with coupon redeemers!) were basically losing their minds, running around, and super stressed.  They had basically given up by the time we were eating. \n\nThat is why I feel like the food poisoning occurred from something truly awful. Like employees deliberately fucking with my food horrible.\n\nI'm not sure what they normally do when people have their birthday at a restaurant, but we weren't offered dessert menus, let alone a comped dessert.  They knew it was my birthday.  They knew at the beginning we were paying the full price.  And still...worst.service.ever.\n\n***I actually filled out a comment card back in November listing my email address and phone number, where I specifically requested to be contacted (again, this was before the food poisoning).  This review was written right after the visit, and I sort of \""""sat\"""" on it for literally over 6 months, in hopes someone would actually contact me.  I gave them the chance, I guess they really just don't give a shit.",0
"My wife and I went to Havana Caf\u00e9 on our 1st date.  Needless to say we love the place and it means something special to us.  We have been there many times.  The past 3 visits have gone downhill quickly.\n\n3 visits ago, the Paella was mediocre at best.  2 visits ago, the service was poor.  This last trip the service was horrid.  The food was good.   However we waited 20 minutes for our check.  There were 6 of us and they added an automatic 20% gratuity.  I understand that is the policy of most places.  But when the service is plain and simply bad that is just not ok.  To top it off, at 6pm on a Saturday evening, it wasn't just warm in the restaurant, it was flat out HOT.  I was sweating for the 2nd half of our dinner and throughout the time we waited to get our check.  The service and temperature made for a very bad experience.  \n\nI am very sad to say that we will not be back to Havana caf\u00e9.",0
"I have eaten here many times, the menu has changed, food is OK.  $1.95 for sour cream, REALLY???  Enough said!  I will not be back.",0

"Kid sized portions- left with a starving stomach and a lighter wallet.  My cup of coffee was not even 1/2 way full.  My food arrived on a doll size plate, only about 5 bitez. Ordered dessert and was quickly let down by that portion, too...shocker. I have seen children's meals with larger portions.  It would take double the amount of food to satisfy me.\nToo bad because if the portions were better I might have been able to appreciate the quality of the food.",0
"This food was Horrible, very bland and dry I had the San Juan Combination. The Rice was dry no season or anthing. Puerto Rican Tamal was hard and dry it should have been moist and flavoral. Plantains was stiff as a rock and again no flavor. Mashed garlics plantains no flavor. My husband had Arroz con pollo the chicken was dry crispy and no flavor. Just save your money. This food had no Pizzazz or party in my mouth. The name sounds cool of the restaurant, but unfortunately so small and scrunched up. I would never recommend my friends or family at this place not even for appetizers and drinks.",0
"I really wanted to like this place, I really did. Unfortunately, our dinner just kept disappointing. Thank baby Jesus for Groupon, because if we had spent full price for our meals, I'd probably develop an eye twitch. \n\nI went with their $18 vegetarian dinner special (poblano stuffed peppers with white beans, covered in a creamy tarragon sauce) over rice. My boyfriend ordered the Gallina Frita (shredded fried chicken breast with onion and Moros- rice and black beans).\n\nThe presentation of the food left something to be desired, but then again, so did the taste. We got pretty small plates (perhaps because I let it slip that we had a coupon?) The vegetarian poblano pepper entree ($18 mind you) had only one half of a stuffed pepper, over plain white rice, and was covered with a cheese sauce that was Velveeta-esque. There were no subtle nuances of flavors, just a bit of creamy slop with boiled tomato bits floating in the cheesy sea of regret. The corn bread that came with the meal was clearly microwaved and was 2\""""x 2\""""-- a sad display. \n\nThe chicken entree was dry and almost tasteless, except for the overly salted moros. My boyfriend didn't even finish the chicken nor did he want my corn bread. This is a first on so many levels. \n\nThis was Cuban cuisine?! Where's the seasoning? The spices? Where is the flavor?! \n\nWe left the Havana cafe and bid adieu to the plastic chairs and the tasteless plates of microwaved sadness.",0
"Growing up in Phoenix, I used to love Havana Cafe. I had birthday dinners here several times. This week, my Dad proposed that we revisit Havana Cafe to celebrate my Master's.\n\nWhen we arrived at 5:30 on a Tuesday, we were one of three tables in the restaurant. The server (there was only one) kept our waters refilled, but it took 25 minutes to have our orders taken. We ordered maduros and black bean fritters to start. The maduros were heavenly, but it is hard to go wrong with a fried plantain. The black bean fritters were... not what I remembered. It may have just been a bad batch, but ours were suspiciously liquid on the inside. \n\nFor entree, I ordered Camarones Havana, my Dad had the Cuban sandwich, and my stepmom got a special: several pieces of pork with black beans and rice, yucca root, and more maduros. Dad loved the Cuban sandwich, stepmom seemed to enjoy the pork, but not much of the sides. We had to add a lot of salt to our food when it arrived, I don't think there was any added in the kitchen. \n\nI was disappointed with my ($22) Camarones Havana. I received no sides, and the plate was just bland. It became marginally better with salt, but still. Where's the flavor? I ended up eating black beans and rice off my parents' plates. \n\nBy the time we left, the restaurant was mostly full inside, with a few people sitting outside. Because there was only one server, it took us another 20 minutes to get boxes and our check. \n\nSad to say I don't think I'll be back, unless it's to order some maduros to go.",0
"I don't have a problem paying $60-$80 for two, but when its worth it.  I think if it wasn't ridiculously over-priced it might have been a better experience.  I'm South American, grew up with Caribbean-Latin American food and I've had better.  But if you've never had Cuban, Puerto Rican or any Latin food; then I guess at least try it once.",0
"What a disappointment! I had been wanting to come here for months. The service was embarrassingly bad. Despite the empty tables, there were 3 different groups waiting at least 15\nminutes to be seated. Everyone in the restaurant seemed to be looking around for their waiter/waitress and looking generally displeased. We requested one of the several tables outside and were told by the surly hostess that we couldn't...because the tables were dirty (and she didn't want to clean them, presumably?). Our drink order was taken and then a clueless waiter came back to re-take it. When he returned, he'd already forgotten my drink order and had to go back the bar to make it. We then saw two of the servers get into an argument in front of us. \n\nEvery table is supposed to get bread and we asked several people for ours when after 30 minutes, we still didn't have it. One waitress even told us, \""""I'm sure it's baking right now.\"""" No offer to check on it, no apologies, nothing. 30 minutes and 2 cocktails later, we looked at the group of disgruntled patrons and decided we would rather take our business elsewhere.",0

"Excellent cheap, authentic Mexican. \n\nI have been coming here since 2003.  As a vegetarian I usually get the vegetarian burrito.  A great deal ($4-$5)! I also enjoy the potato and cheese burrito ordered off menu ($3). The chips, quacumole and cheese are made with quality ingredients and I never skip the amazing salsa bar. I decided to be adventurous recently and get the cheese enchilidas with rice and beans. The sauce was tasty but the rest fell short. I'll stick to the burrito.\n\nIt helps if you or your dining buddy speak basic spanish.

If you spit on me I will wipe it off and take the abuse to be able to experience the pizza.

"The only reason I go to this place is because it's across the street from the hotel I stay at when I'm in town. Normally the service is ok, but today was different. Waited 5+ minutes for somebody to finally come out of the back and take my order. When he did it really didn't seem like he was paying attention. Maybe it was the cigarette tucked behind his ear. I walk back to my room and nothing on my order was correct. I went back and returned it and asked for my money back. Guess I won't be supporting this business during my future trips!",0
"This is the dive bar that connects Phoenix and Scottsdale. Why do we love it so? Well, of course, .50 Taco Night (Thursday)! What else do you need? Some draft beer, a few good friends, kick ass conversation and some damn good tacos .\n\nOh yeah, J.T is a Sooner!\n\nBoomer Sooner! Go OU!",1
"The square footage of this place is about the same as my credit score. But I am not opposed to a cozy, dive bar on the Phoenix/Scottsdale border. This place actually reminded me of bars in San Fran the way it is long and narrow. This place had a good vibe and crowd (ages ranging from early 20's to mid 50's). \nThe grilled wings were pretty delicious and the drinks were definitely reasonable. My tab was around $50 after 2 dozen wings, 3 draft beers, 2 chick drinks, and a pair of Jameson shots. \nThe owner of the joint (and I know he was the owner because he was helping himself to drinks behind the bar) walks around and glad-hands the regulars while swapping tales of past and soon-to-be glories of Sooner football.\nI have never even set foot in the great state of Oklahoma but after a few drinks at this bar, it will have you whooping \""""Boomer Sooner\"""" with the rest of the regulars. Whatever-the-fuck that means.",1
"JT, JT, JT....OMG...the wings will make you take flight. They are the most delicious little mouth delights. Serious ..dude should have a solid gold chicken wing out front. They are grilled to perfection, the degree of heat or flavor is right everytime. The bar is fun, fun, fun! The regulars may look you over a time or two..but hey I'm good lookin so I don't mind. lol. The tacos rock out Thursday night.  The only problem with JT's is, he's not open on Sunday for football..and that pisses me off every time I remember on hangover Sunday, that I forgot to get them on Saturday. Damnit, I hate that I have to go there twice a week.  Cuz he is open for Monday night football..oh ya.....screw  it..I'm going right now...c ya...",1
"So my good friend, the pilot calls and says, \""""Kimberly, can your yuppy ass hang at a dive bar?\"""" and Im like, \"""" Bring all the dive you got baby...\"""", of course, hes about as preppie as they come... and we end up at JT's... OSU banners adorn the place... its long and narrow.. and we got the once or twice over as we walked in... the bar tender, Rebecca was sweet and informative... The place is simple... and cheap... and packed... The wings seemed to be the thing... and Im wishing I had a taste for them... just never have been a fan. But they looked good... My friend had a burger... it was piled high with mushrooms.. I had a grilled chicken sandwiche...basic, but I needed food if I was drinking with a pilot, after all... 2 Guiness, 4 Harp, 2 shots and 2 burgers... and the bill was about $45, thats a pretty good thing...",1
"I'm a fan of J.T.'s.  Reasonable drinks and REALLY good wings.  It's small, so it can get pretty crowded, but the people are friendly, service is good, too.  J.T. 's is a great neighborhood bar, nearly free of any douchebaggery.",1
"I was introduced to this bar by an old landlord in arcadia. at the time i was not a buffalo wings kinda guy but that has all changed. this place has set the bar for wings in phx for me. fried, sauced and then grilled. weeknight special $5 for a dozen wings. Bad part: not open on football sundays.",1
"A true dive bar that makes you feel comfortable. As a traveler for work, sitting in the hotel room on a Friday night was just not going to work.  So I fire up my trusty yelp app. and off I go. JTs was not hard to find and even less hard to enjoy.\n\nThe place is small. Barely large enough to walk past the stools.  The bar is clean and dark. The decor is very reminiscent of underground grunge clubs.  The bartenders were very nice and easy on the eyes. They were accommodating and never made you feel like you were bothering them.\n\nI had two blue moons and two margaritas and the works hot wings. The wings were excellent though by the time they got to me the two blur moons had inhibited my ability to properly taste food. Anyway, the wings were crunchy and lightly sweet with a hint of whatever sauce they used.  They were not smothered so the taste was well balanced.  Granted this is not one of those places you go for margaritas but\nIt is my favorite drink so I had to try.  The margaritas did not impress but I never expected them to.\n\nI had some conversation with random people while waiting to sober up. The bar tender did not rush me and let me take my time before I was well enough to drive.  Don't drink and drive kids!\n\nBy the way, thanks to two female patrons at the bar for their interesting perspective on mixed martial arts.  I won't mention it here so people can go to the bar and have the interesting conversation themselves.\n\nDefinitely if I was a resident of Phoenix I would come here frequently.  I love local places like this.",1
"Best bar in Arcadia.\n\nBest wings I have ever tasted.\n\nWorst bathrooms in the Valley.\n\nArcadia, I miss you.",1
"JT's effin rocks.  All the food is very good, great tasting bar food at it's best but the thing you have to get is the wings.  These are the best wings in town, bar none!  They are flavorful and addictive!",1
"Im very confused about all these good reviews.\n\nLast night my girlfriend brought me to Jt's, her boss said the wings were great. So I figured I'll try it.\nWhen we get there, the lot is filled, I figured this is a good sign. But that where the optimism ended.\nWe had to sit near the back, the smell and temperature were almost unbearable, but I figured I wanted to try the food. My girlfriend ordered wings, she wanted ranch, I only eat wings with Blue Cheese, then I get a burger and onion rings... And a coke. \n\nAfter a long wait, the server brought us our drinks, in a red solo cup, and my coke was not coke, but RC Cola... So far, its not going well. \nThe waitress comes back a little later to let us know, there's no more onion rings.\n\nAfter a long wait, we finally get the wings, as she sets them down, thats when she lets me know there's no more blue cheese. If I was by myself, I would have left at that point, I was also hungry. \n\nMy burger came, it was one of those pre made paddies you get at cosco, I lifted the bun and the whole patty fell apart. The cheese was some sort of burned shredded cheese. \n\nI counted the 'fries' I received with he burger, I counted 12 small pathetic fries. \n\nThese wings everyone talks about were burnt and dry, this confuses me the most. \nI mentioned to my girlfriend that I don't think her boss likes her, people must send patrons there when they dislike them. \n\nWith all the places in the valley to get really good wings, good service and other good dishes, I put this mystery of why people rave about this place up there with the mystery of the pyramids... \n\nUgh, I still cant get the image of that sorry burger out of my mind!",0
Wings were OK. Liked the Yella Pilsner draft special. Decent dive bar. Real good ranch!,0
"On 2nd thought, the people who drink at this place just keep drinking and never leave. That leads to obnoxious drunks with grey hair on their head feeling empowered by a few cocktails. This place isn't a dive bar, it's a wasteland for aholes in that \""""ritzy\"""" area to act like idiots. My verbal exchange with one of the patrons last night was quite impressive. People in this part of Phoenix are punks and your bars are small and overcrowded. Also, it would be advisable not to give drunken or any customers control of the bar remote control. This could lead to alot more verbal spats.",0
Great tasting food at great price. Drinks are ok.  How can one mess up a fun and tonic?,1
"My favorite local bar, hands down, for the past going on 15 years now. JT's is the diary I don't keep (for good reason). I can always go in and pour my heart out to one of the girls while they pour me a Jack and Coke. Best chicken wings on the planet too. And John Taylor's like family to me. Make sure you pop in when Beth is behind the counter. She's a doll and a good listener! I don't have enough love in my heart for this fine establishment.\n\nOh yeah, and if you can't deal with true dive bar bathrooms, do not go here! Just part of the John Taylor charm, if you ask me!",1
"\""""Tongue in Cheek\"""" review to follow. \n\nWhat a dive bar but oh so much fun. I loved the bar tender. \""""Aloha\""""  Barender Gal moving to Hawaii. ( take me with you) You put up with two loud birthday gals and a large bunch of drunk woman walking into your very small, neighborhood bar at midnight. Every head turned when we walked in. It is a pretty small place. teehee! (Just an FYI, not all of us were drunk, but maybe we were, Hmmmmmmmmm??? Insert pinkie to the side of the mouth style) \n\nJust kidding. We had a blast and the place is such a typical neighborhood Divey Bar. Check it out. Not sure the prices since the man next to us was buying all the drinks and I was the DD.",1
"First, don't be alarmed by the cramped space, dingy surroudings and Arcadia townie vibe. It's a a great dive bar with fabulous wings. The burgers are great, too, along with other daily specials. It can be a little Arcadia 'clique-y' and you won't get much sports watching here given the tight space. It is a good place for Oklahoma football games, though, despite the cramped quarters. It's our mainstay for food, drinks and friendly people.",1
"Uuugh!!!! What a rip off. I came in from out of town and hung out with my buddy Joe. He highly recommended JT's because of their awesome wings and tiny tacos. What he didn't know was that most of the positive reviews of this place on Yelp are ancient reviews from when Julio was still working there. This place had the kiss of death and was taken over by cheap, shady owners. The new owners want to cut cost but still cash in on the positive word of mouth about the food. They also raised the prices. So in essence, the new owners are producing a cr@p product and charging us more money! To add insult to injury they shorted us 2 chicken wings. Talk about trifflin'!! If they're shorting people wings, I'd hate to know what they're doing to their drinks. When we got them they were cold all the way down to the bones and stale like they had been made as a mistake earlier in the day, boxed up and given to us (short 2 wings!!!). The tacos were bland like they just cooked some ground beef without seasoning and threw it in the shell. I added the salsa to try to add some flavor to it but it didn't cut it. I'm sure MY taco has more flavor than this one did. Most of the wings and tacos are still in the fridge and will inevitably meet their fate at the bottom of the garbage can. In conclusion, if you want over priced, piece of cr@p wings that don't taste half as good as frozen ones and tacos that taste better when they come out of you than going in, go to JTs so they can pi$$ on you face and tell you it's raining!\n*Additionally, don't believe the review underneath mines. I'm almost 100% positive it was done by someone who works for them or has some sort of affiliation with this place. It's written like an advertisement. The wings look NOTHING like they do in that picture. This review would be VASTLY different if they did. Our wings were all limp and flaccid when they showed up to film. Nice try you guys. You make me sick.",0
"Excellent Neighborhood ShitHole ! Consistently inconsistent, seldom open and catering to EVERY demographic in the PHX. \nCan't wait to pass on this place for years to come ! Owner must be proud. \nCheers & good luck",0
"Another day of wing quest...and I have to say, this little \""""divey\"""" bar is a gem. You will miss it if you drive too fast, the bar itself has little in the way of signage. They do have a street-side sign that you can navigate by. The d\u00e9cor is, well \""""tchotchkes\"""" hanging from the ceiling. Think \""""Shoefiti\"""" meets grandma's garage sale...\n\nDoesn't change the fact that they have $5 mini pitchers and awesome wings in various flavors, soaked and then grilled to perfection. I don't mind looking at shrunken heads hanging from the rafters when I am biting into wing heaven. Service was personable and quick.",1
Best wing's (the works!!) and sports bar atmosphere ever! The best music is always playing!,1
They were super helpful. I brought in a ski jacket that had been beat up and when I got it back I swear it looked brand new....as white as when I had first bought it. They even offered to deliver it to me.  These guys are AMAZING!!!,1
"I found this gem on Yelp (go figure)and have taken numerous shirts, jackets, pants, and dresses etc.to be cleaned.  This company lives up to it's name.  The staff is prompt, professional, and reliable.  The owner takes customer service very seriously and values customer loyalty.  I used the spend $30 for $50 coupon on the yelp site and redeemed it from my phone.  It was a true breeze.  The owner (I'm assuming) explained they have delivery service free of charge.  I agree witb his philosophy- dry cleaning should be hassle free.  Quality work every time, no exceptions.  Not necessarily the cheapest, but absolutely the best.  You get what you pay for.  Cheers!  \n\nOne request for the owner: please put a fan (or anything to cool) in the receiving area.  That place can get toasty for those that choose to pick up in person.",1
"We recently moved and were looking for a laundry service. We always use a laundry service because A, we hate to fold, and B, it is usually around the same price as doing it ourselves, but works with our busy schedules. We left the DC area paying roughly $1 per pound (mind you DC is the 3rd most expensive city in the US) expecting something in that ball park (an average load for us has been roughly $20-$30).  First off, we get no estimate when we drop off 28 pounds of laundry, so needless to say when we went pick it up we were shocked at the over $100 price for our laundry.  Granted they gave us a deal ($96 instead of the original charge) and fancy bags to carry our stuff, but furthermore they even charged us for the wrong weights.  Needless to say, even at the correct weight they are overpriced! We will be going somewhere else where laundry service.",0
"I had no problem redeeming the 30-50 coupon. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. \nThe clothes came out clean, except one that said they couldn't take the stains off without damaging the item, that item was charge which I don't think it should; since it was not cleaned. \nThe price on my personal opinion it's very expensive. I took 11 pieces and paid with coupon over $80.",1
Best customer service I've ever had at a cleaners! They were so friendly and fast. I've used them twice and will always use them.,1
"Excellent service in every way.Been using them for years. Always accommodating, pick up by Jeff always smiles and prompt. Dave is the best owner.",1
"I'm a little biased since I used to work here.  Nonetheless, it's a great nursery.  It's got quality plants, quality service and quality gardening supplies.  The customer service is especially good and the care taken of the plants is outstanding.  The only drawback is the price, but with the quality of everything so good, what else do you expect?",1
"This is a beautiful nursery with a broad selection of plants. I came in mid-January and was surprised at how big the selection of plants was so early in the season. You'd think such a well stocked and esthetically pleasing nursery would be very pricey but I found them to be reasonable. Actually, I found them to be more reasonable than Baker.\n\nI am not a rose growing expert but Berridge has the largest selection I have ever seen. Many are the tall potted variety but they also have some growing in trenches that they dig up when you pick yours out.\n\nThey do not have a huge selection of organic fertilizers or seeds here, which is the only reason why I am giving them less than 5 stars. Unfortunately, I do not live in AZ otherwise I would love to come back and check out the veggies in the spring.",1
"this was a nice find. my usual nursery was out of thuricide, a chemical i desperately needed to thwart the skeletonizers ravaging my beautiful grapes. \n\nthe place is well laid out, but felt a bit over my comfort zone....much like that fancy gym on camelback.....\n\ni don't know if their prices overall are more expensive given their location,  but the staff was extremely knowledgeable in helping me find what i needed. i have driven by here and noticed their gates are close at 5pm? isn't that when most regular people get off work and need to shop for stuff?",1
"I go to Berridge's to find the things I don't find at Home Depot or Lowe's. They carry interesting varieties that you will not see elsewhere--more colors of bougainvillea, different types of cycads, etc. Probably equally important, I find it easier to get expert advice than at either Whitfill's or Bakers--both good nurseries as well. So there are two good reasons to go to Berridge's. \n\n1. If you are an experienced gardener who is looking for something a little more interesting than you find at Home Depot. \n\n2. Or if you are not especially experienced and need honest advice about what plant to put in the spot you are thinking about.\n\nI went in looking for a few plants, each for a different place, and so I had different questions for each one. Normally, nursery guys are good for about one question. Pretty soon after that they lose patience. But the man who helped me stayed focused as I changed from one question to another. And he even suggested how I could improve my irrigation settings.",1
"The two stars are for the young lady that helped us purchase the glasses. The doctor barely said 5 words to me, didn't go over his findings of my sons exam and just seemed all around kind of creepy. We won't be returning.",0
"This place has gone down hill.  I have been here over the past few years and until today have had decent experiences.  I showed up to my appointment 10 minutes early and was required to fill out paperwork (is there a reason they don't keep a file for me?) but again, I was early so whatever.  I was done in 5 minutes but had to sit and listen to front desk staff discussing personal issues (babysitters' schedule, going to lunch, making fun of a poor lady who called for directions to the office two times, etc) until finally heading to the back around 9:20.  While waiting I couldn't help to notice that the place is dirty - trash on the floor,etc.\nI go to the first round of tests and Megan (I think that was her name) the tech was awesome.  Except when she had me remove my contacts in their bathroom --- to spare you I will just say that it was more of a mess than the waiting room.\nThe dr exam was also pleasant and quick.  My current contacts were discontinued so she recommended a new brand and even gave me a sample set to wear home with my new prescription.\nI went upfront to pay and was expecting my $20 co-pay as in years' past.  They charge me $60.  So of course I asked why and it was explained to me that this year they had given me a contact exam so that's why the additional charge.  What the?!  I've worn/renewed contacts for 4 years and have always gotten my exam from them.  In my opinion nothing has changed but I had no choice but to pay, obviously.  I called my insurance immediately to see if there was something that had changed with the plan and the agent said no and then asked if I order contacts through Nationwide or elsewhere.  I always do my exam at Nationwide where my exam is covered by medical insurance and order contacts/glasses at another place where my actual vision insurance is accepted.  Here's the kicker-- because there was no change, the insurance agent thinks Nationwide is charging more because I mentioned I wouldn't order though them.  Looking back, I'm not sure I was so honest in past years.  This makes me sick because I know I've been \""""had\"""".\nI should've run away from how dirty the place was anyhow because now I keep thinking about whether or not they sanitize anything that touched my face... *shudder*\nOn the up-side, this place is next to Wildflower for a good muffin & good cup of coffee.",0
"Worst place ever! First time I came here for my contact lens fitting appointment I had to wait 1 hr + and that was with an appointment. No apologies from the staff for the long wait either. Second time I went to finalize my prescription I told the doctor about how the contacts didn't feel right, I couldn't see very clearly. I've been wearing contacts for years. Discovered that on top of all the waiting the doctor and staff are incompetent because they incorrectly ordered my contacts for me and changed my -2.75 prescription to a +2.75.  Do not go here! They suck! This is for the location at 4280 E Indian School.",0
The Worst Customer Service Experience in a long time.  Long wait times while giving off lots of attitude while you wait.  Amazed at the consistency of the poor attitude of every single employee in the place.  Do yourself a favor and stay away!,0
"I purchased glasses on 5-3-13.  I am still waiting to receive the glasses that I paid for.  I paid on 5-3-13 and then waited.  After waiting two weeks I called to see when my glasses would be ready and was put on hold.  I was on hold forever when I was finally told that the factory had made an error with my prescription and that they had to be sent back.  I was told that they would rush the service and call me as soon as the glasses were ready.  I waited a week and called to see when the glasses would be ready and was told they just arrived.  I went in and picked them up.  I wore the glasses for two days when a friend informed me that the glasses were not darkening in the sun.  He showed me how the lenses did not change at all in the direct sun light.  I took the glasses back and the representative tried to convince me that the lenses were exactly what I had ordered.  When I asked her to step outside in the sunlight and show me she suddenly decided that maybe all I had was the anti-glare and the lenses were not correct.  She said she would correct the glasses and would do a rush service on the glasses. One week later I was called and told the glasses were ready.  When I went in to pick them up on my lunch I was so disappointed.  They were now trying to give me plain old glasses with the line across the lenses.  I did not want to try them on but the representative insisted.  I told her I was not blind that I could clearly see the line on the lenses so they could not be my glasses.  She insisted that I needed to try them on.  I told her that I want a refund and NO I am not trying the glasses on.  She said she would go get a manager.  I sat there for 15 minutes waiting.  I then met with Diana the Manager.  I was clear that I wanted a refund that I was patient and they had three chances to do my glasses and they could not get the job done.  I am going on vacation next week and I am going on vacation with my glasses and you have not been capable up to this point.  Diana then stated that she would  personally take care of my glasses and that they would be correct and that I would have them in time for my vacation.  She said she would give me a discount for the inconvenience I had been experiencing.  She looked me in the eye and gave me her word.  I looked her back in the eye and said if you do not get it right I will contact her corporate office and then I would find every review place I can to share my experience.  I picked the glasses up today.  I met with Diana and asked if she had checked them and is everything I paid for there and she said yes.  She put my lenses in the glasses and I tried them on.  The glasses seemed to be ok.  Things looked a little fuzzy and the ground appeared to be moving.  I was told there is an adjustment time and that it would clear up soon.  We went outside and I tried them on and they seemed to be more shaded than my old pair of glasses.  We went in and she did some more adjustments to the glasses and cleaned them.  I again asked her if all the features I paid for are on the glasses and she said yes.  She went outside again with the glasses while I was waiting and she checked them in the sun.  Diana said yes everything is on the glasses that you ordered.  I was running late on my lunch hour and was feeling rushed to get back to the office.  Diana refunded $39.99 on the glasses for the inconvenience I experienced.  When I got home tonight and stood out in the sun for five minutes, nothing happened.  The lenses do not darken at all.  The lenses do appear to have a thick anti-glare coating.  There definitely is no change to the lenses when standing in direct sunlight.  I will return tomorrow morning and get my refund.  I am concerned that they will make the refund difficult, but if a refund is not given then I would have to call their actions fraudulent. I had insurance that paid a portion of the bill.  The insurance company has also been charged for an item not received. If necessary I will be calling the fraud department at United Health Care. I have been deceived and feel like a foolish woman.  I am foolish to the tune of \n$ 793.90.  I will follow up this post with the results of my visit tomorrow where I intend to get a refund.\n5-5-2013 Went back this morning to return the glasses.  The representative put them under a special lite they had and presto the glasses got dark. We then went outside and the glasses were definitely darker.  I really felt like something was wrong because I had the glasses outside at home for an hour in and out of the sunlight and they never got dark like they did at the store. The glasses are still fuzzy when I try to read small print.  I am going to bring them to my eye doctor to have them checked to see if they have been made to the prescription that I was given. I also double checked my paperwork and noticed a $135.00 copay I was charged.  My benefits show that I have a $25.00 copay. I will be calling United Health Care Monday to verify my benefits.",0
"I purchased $ 793.00 glasses on 5-3-13.  I am on the fourth set of glasses which translates into 6 trips to Nationwide Vision Center.  Six trips for one item!  How many chances do you give a professional business to deliver on one $ 800.00 item?  Ok, maybe I assumed they were a professional business.  I have a simple bifocal subscription.  When I ordered I asked for glasses without the lines on the lenses.  I also asked for glasses that worked like sunglasses outside and regular glasses indoors.  I was given a bill and I paid my portion and was told I would be called when the glasses were ready.  I called two weeks after ordering my glasses and was told the factory made an error and the glasses were sent back to the factory.  A week later I called and the glasses were ready.  When I put the glasses on everything felt a little wobbly but I was told there is an adjustment period. I was not wearing the glasses for driving so it was a couple of days before I noticed there was not a sunglass effect standing in the sun.  Disappointed I took the glasses back.  The representative tried to convince me that the lenses were exactly what I had ordered.  When I asked her to step outside in the sunlight and show me she suddenly decided that maybe all I had was the anti-glare and the lenses were not correct.  She said she would correct the glasses and call me when they were ready. One week later I was called and told the glasses were ready.  When I went in to pick them up on my lunch hour I was once again let down.  They were now trying to give me plain old glasses with the line across the lenses.  I did not want to try them on but the representative insisted.  I told her I could clearly see the line on the lenses so they could not be my glasses.  She insisted that I needed to try them on.

She looked me in the eye and gave me her word.  I looked her in the eye and replied that I was a letter writer.  If the glasses were not correct I would contact Nationwide Vision Center corporate headquarters, Facebook and any forum available to express my dissatisfaction with Nationwide Vision Center product and service.  I picked up the glasses on 6-14-13.  I met with Diana and asked if she had checked the glasses and she said yes.  She put my lenses in the glasses and I tried them on.  The glasses seemed to be ok.  Things looked a little fuzzy and the ground appeared to be moving.  I was told again that there is an adjustment time and that it would clear up soon.  We went outside and they seemed to be more shaded than my old pair of glasses.  When we went inside again I asked her if all the features I ordered were on the glasses and she said yes.  She went outside again with the glasses while I was waiting and she checked them in the sun.  Diana stated again that the glasses were what I ordered.  I was running late on my lunch hour and was feeling rushed to get back to the office. When you go in to pick up glasses you should expect it to be an hour to an hour and fifteen minutes.  Diana discounted $39.99 on the glasses.  When I got home that night and stood out in the sun for five minutes, nothing happened.  The lenses did not darken.  The lenses have a purple/rose colored hue when I am indoors and outdoors. I did not detect a change to the lenses when standing in direct sunlight.

The representative put them under a special light they had and presto the glasses got very dark.  We then went outside and the glasses were definitely darker.  I asked the customer service representative why the glasses were a purple/rose hue outside in the sun and not grey.  I ordered gray and I had expected to see grey.  He said no that is the gray (yes the Emperor has clothes).  He then added that the lenses are effected by heat and the lenses will not get as dark outside in Phoenix as they would in Flagstaff.  He repeated it again that if I go to Flagstaff the glasses would be significantly darker.  I do not live in Flagstaff, I live in Phoenix and I purchased my glasses in Phoenix and I expect them to work in Phoenix.  The glasses are still fuzzy when I try to read small print.  I have not been able to darken the lenses to the level they did in the store with their special UV light.  I left the glasses out in the direct sun for 2 hours.  This is starting to feel like a bait and switch scam.",0

The selections are endless and the flavors are incredible. It makes one feel comfortable to venture off the path and chose something new. I guarantee this establishment is worth the drive, wait, and traffic. My personal menu favorites are the Walnut Shrimp, Pot Stickers, Fried Wontons, Hot and Sour Soup, and the Sizzling Rice Soup. \nBut I don't want to waste anymore of your time, get out of the house and head to Desert Jade!",1
"I just love little places like Desert Jade, too cute!!  It had the charm of a restaurant back in the midwest. We started off with the pork dumplings, very moist and tasty. Just one negative a friend had the curry chicken it was a little too bland.  Overall I would definitely suggest this restaurant.",1
This is by far the best Chinese food in the valley. The pan fried noodles and sesame chicken are AWESOME!!!! I eat here at least once a week.,1
"It seems to me that many Phoenicians have a \""""jaded\"""" (pun INTENDED) view of what real, authentic Chinese food looks and tastes like, and those people are the ones who said this was the best Chinese food they've ever had. \n\nI'm sorry, but I was NOT that impressed with the food here. I came here last night with a group of 6 people and we did the whole \""""family style\"""" thing. A couple people ordered potstickers and said they were really good (and at least the waitress warned them that they would take 15 minutes to make) but others were not that impressed with the wonton soup. \n\nMy dish was actually pretty good (Ginger Chicken), but a couple of the other plates looked a little sketch (I mean, the Walnut Shrimp was literally a plate with shrimp, then a huge serving of broccoli and then a pile of walnuts....IT WASN'T EVEN MIXED IN!!) I was also disappointed with the \""""fried rice\"""" they served with the meal, which was just fried with some soy sauce (no eggs, no veggies). The Mu Shu was ok, but I actually prefer the one at P.F. Chang's. \n\nAll in all, it wasn't horrible, but as the 2 Star rating indicates, I've DEFINITELY HAD BETTER!! \n\nAlmost three stars for great service, though!!!",0
"Seeing all the cars parked in their parking lot and as it was time for lunch, I decided to give it a try.  The staff was very efficient.  I think I waited a whole 10 minutes to get my food.  I ordered the Mongolian beef.  The sauce was too sweet and the meat-well it reminded me of mystery meat.  Not a very memorable meal.",0
BEST CHINESE IN TOWN!!!!  I've been coming here for almost 13 years now and its my favorite Chinese restaurant. They have great food and never disappoint. The staff is Very Friendly and helpful!! \nYou Have to get their House Special Chicken or Sesame Chicken (same thing)!!,1
Went for lunch and was very disappointed. Restaurant smells musty and the food was awful. Service was very good.,0
"I had driven by this place at least twice a day on my way to and from work and always thought it was one of those shady Chinese places that would end up on the news for at least three years. And then one day I had a craving for Chinese did a search for the nearest Chinese restaurant and this place popped up. The ratings were fantastic, so I thought I should give it a try. \n\nI placed an order to go, went to pick it up, parked my car and opened the door...it was an OASIS inside! I have to say, I was fooled by the outside.. The food is awesome. I usually get the Moo Shu Pork and my husband gets something new and we share. Everything is so good and, most importantly, you don't get that ill feeling (that sometimes Chinese food seems to make you feel, you know what I mean the \""""I just ate a ton of grease and my day is shot\"""" feeling). \n\nWe have been regulars for a couple of years now and I couldn't recommend it enough.",1
Always greeted with a SMILE (and a HUG)!  \n\nGreat Food!  Great Service!  \n\nGreat family owned restaurant that really cares about their customers. They remember their regulars by name and ask about your family members or friends.\n\nAlways fresh ingredients and no msg. Always consistently delicious!,1
"I know this place is a Phoenix institution.  And it is quite nice inside compared to many Chinese restaurants.  I was invited to lunch here by a colleague who had dined here many times in the past.\n\nI felt the lunch menu was perhaps a bit overpriced, given the quantity and quality of food.\n\ni ordered the kung pao shrimp ($8.25), which was a spicy dish, but ordered it HOT.  It came so mild I might as well have ordered shrimp in lobster sauce, with some peanuts thrown in.   There were about 10 peanuts, a 1/2 cup of sauteed green onions, and about 4 medium sized shrimp, to go with fried rice that had nothing in it and an egg roll the size of my thumb.  It WAS nice it came with hot tea.\n\nWas it outrageously priced?  Absolutely not.  Would I eat here again if someone invited me?  Of course.  But if it's my choice, there are much better Chinese restaurants to be found.",0
"I've been searching for a decent take out Chinese place for awhile, and there are a few in this area. This hap pend to be the first one I tried, and maybe ordering the traditional take out dishes was the downfall, but I was disappointed. \n\nMy girlfriend and I ordered beef with snow peas and water chestnuts, and a spicy vegetable kung pao type thing with fried rice. The flavor, quality, and freshness of the ingredients was very bland and seemed to be more of a public cafeteria type quality. The menu had a number of specialty dishes, so maybe we ordered the wrong items, but I don't think I'll be going back to find out.",0
"I have not been here in awhile, so I thought since I am in the area I will pick up a lunch togo.  I ordered the sesame chicken lunch special (chicken, rice, and an egg roll).  I bought it back to the office, it smelled good and the togo box was stuff with food.  I wished it tasted as good as it smelled.  The sauce was kind of bland.  I was so bummed.  I guess I need to find another chinese take out place.",0
"You can't go wrong here  .. they have been around for more than 30 years, same free standing \""""Hunters\"""" house decor inside the dining room , but always GREAT FOOD !  open til 11:00pm,  best place in the neighborhood , Owners are super friendly . ! great place for take out service weekly !   totally recommend the (  HUGH ) Shrimp Egg foo young, feeds 2 !",1
"I had one hour for lunch, and had heard this was one of the best places in town. I expected the lunch combo would come with a cup of soup - but not here, even though lunch is hi-priced. The weather was cold, so I wanted soup. I ordered sizzling rice soup and some egg rolls. It took 45 minutes between the time I sat down and when I got my food! The soup was not sizzling, and had small round BURNT rice cakes floating in the cup. BURNT BLACK. I had ten minutes to eat and get back to the office, so I could not return my meal. I fished out the burnt pieces and ate quickly. Maybe this place had a good rep in the past, but I will never go back there!",0
"I was disappointed with the quality of food. The won tons were very bland, and the main dish was doused in this weird peanut sauce that completely covered the flavor of shrimp, broccoli, chicken, beef, and the other vegetables in it. The pork ribs were also just bland. It's an alright restaurant, but I probably won't return because nothing impressed me.",0
Great food.  Great service.,1
"First I must say it was wild to walk inside of a Chinese Restaurant and find a bar.....a decently stocked bar. Even though we didn't order anything alcoholic; it was nice to know we had the option. The place was decently decorated. We ordered several Egg rolls, Spicy Beef & Sesame Chicken. I was surprised that my Sesame chicken looked like a half of an entire chicken. It was pretty good & we did have a lot of food!!! The service was really good & we didn't have to ask for anything. For all the food we received the $30.00 wasn't much.",1
"I'm on the constant hunt for good Chinese food in Phoenix. After many disappointing meals, I found Desert Jade and haven't looked back. The restaurant is super clean and quaint inside (even a big fireplace) and the service is great. Each of our servers have been super friendly and attentive. The food is really good. It's not going to blow you away, but it's fresh, portions are just right and I've never left unsatisfied. \n\nI really like the Kung Pao Chicken, the Mu Shu Pork, Spicy Chicken with Vegetables (lots of them), and my husband loooves the glazed walnut shrimp.\n\nIf you're looking for an easy, casual Chinese meal in Phoenix - I promise you this is one of your best bets.",1
"Nuthin better after a few fun games of bowling down the street than a good Chinese meal at my favorite Chinese restaurant!   LOL  By the way, make sure to try their Chinese vegetables--they're authentic and delicious!",1
"WORST FOOD EVER!! \n\nI went there for their lunch specials and got the sweet and sour chicken. \n\nThe egg roll was great, but the sweet and sour chicken was horrible. The sauce had no flavor and ruined my entire dish. Depending on your liking, the there were very thick peices of chicken within the dish with very little breading. I personal enjoy breading with my sweet and sour chicken.",0
"I still like Desert Jade. I go there every once in awhile. The noodles are not as crispy as they used to be and the food is not as fresh as it once was, but I still enjoy the food here. I went for lunch today. My mom got chicken with snow peas, which was very good and I had wonton soup, which was pretty bland. The sweet and sour chicken is still the BF's favorite and the service is still very good. They are always efficient. And the almond cookies....yum.",1
"The food wasn't very good. My girlfriend and I could only eat like a quarter of meal before we asked for a boxes (just to be nice, we don't plan on eating them). We then drove across the street to McDonalds.  I would like to note the waiter was super nice but that doesn't really help later when your stomach hurting. I hope it was just the dishes we ordered (spicy chicken w/ red sauce and chicken with vegetables in spicy sauce) because ironically the restaurant ambiance was very cozy and all the staff was extremely nice.",0
Really good Chinese food. I always get Singapore rice noodles and add extra vegetables and I've never been disappointed. Hot and sour soup is good and they are really quick for take-out. Owners are very friendly.,1
The best Chinese food in the valley! Ever had any problems with the service or food. The tea is fantastic as well.,1
"I get the Singapore rice noodles takeout once in a while and I am always happy with my food.\n\nThe Singapore noodles are good and they come with shrimp and pork. They are the drier version of this dish (not swimming in sauce), which I prefer. I also don't really like shrimp and they substitute the shrimp with chicken.\n\nI always get take out so i can't comment on a dining experience, but the take out is always fast and ready to go when they say it will be.\n\nGood food, fast friendly service.",1
"I read the awesome reviews on this site, therefore my expectations were high. After all, Phoenix is plagued with AWFUL Chinese restaurants. \n\nOur entire dinner was bland. The sauce that accompanied the Fried Wontons was insipid and flavorless. Red, thick sauce should be sweet. This was not. Unimpressed. The pot stickers were ok, but nothing special enough to write home about.\n\nI was leery about ordering the Tangerine Beef, because I had a rancid dish of the same name from a different Chinese restaurant a couple years ago. Thought I'd give it a go. Bland. Beef pounded into oblivion smothered with a sauce so faint that it cried for flavor. \n\nThe Sesame Chicken, bland as well, was overcooked and nowhere near as sweet as one should like.\n\nThe Kung Pao Chicken was the least amusing dish of all. No flavor, no heat, and no veggies. \n\nThe Mu Shu Pork was ok, but the plum sauce was, again, bland!\n\nNow, the cleanliness and presentation of the restaurant was in face phenomenal. Very clean and the lit candles on the tables were a very nice touch.\n\nThe service was legendary. Very chipper, friendly, and at times amusing. There was an older lady whose job apparently was to take dirty dishes from the tables and only says \""""thank you!\"""" when she does anything near you.\n\nI noticed that a great many of the diners were very elderly. Is there a retirement village nearby? Do you not realize that the elderly LOVE buffets and bland food? This restaurant was full of both, and I think it was the army of elderly people with diminishing taste buds who wrote all those glowing reviews.\n\nI understand that people have varying opinions and tastes, but come on! Raise your standards and start asking yourself if the food you are tasting really deserves FOUR or FIVE stars? Fail.",0
"My first time there and the food was good!  We weren't super hungry so we just had an order of pepper beef, brown rice and bbq pork chow mein.\n\nEverything tasty but the chow mein was above average!  I expected a sauce noodle dish or a thicker lomein type dish because that's what it usually is in most Chinese restaurants... but here it is the very thin noodles and they are fried, with huge portions of pork and veggies spooned over it so the noodles soak up just enough without making them soggy.\n\nIt's almost cliche to order pork chow mein when you go out to Chinese food, but here it's worth it.  I'll revisit them when I'm more hungry and try some other things!",1
"My mom and I recently started on a quest for the best po po platter in Phoenix. So naturally we ended up here. With the amazing reviews and extremely high prices I was ready to be impressed. I was not. In fact, this was what my mom called \""""the worst American Chinese food I've had in my life\"""". The food was bland and greasy, to the point where we felt so bad that we took the majority of our overpriced entrees to our house just to throw it out. The po po platter (which they called a Bo Bo platter?) was dry and the plum sauce accompanying it was watery. My sweet and sour chicken, was tough and cold. The meat, not covered in what would be a sweet red sauce, was snow White. My mothers 'Desert Jade Shrimp' was, as she said, \""""only covered in butter\"""". The only two good things in this restaurant  was the Mai Tais and the service. I was appalled by this meal. It was not worth the trip.",0
"This is the best American Chinese food we have had in the valley. Anytime we want great Chinese food, we drive here. It's out of the way but we'll worth the drive. Today I ordered the Peking Pork & House fried rice. My GF had the sweet & sour chicken. Each dish was amazing and worth adding to your next dining experience. The service is always exceptional. This is our favorite place for American Chinese food.",1
"A great place to get some American Chinese food. This is the best I've found in the valley. I usually order the house chow mein (get ready for some serious broccoli action!) and the peking pork; I am planning on being adventurous and trying spicy next time, since the medium is fairly mild. The service is super fast, and I always go home with leftovers. Their lunch specials are perfectly priced and the portions? Well, they're perfect, too. Get ready to be happy and full. Dinner is a little pricey, so I gave them 4 stars.",1
"Delicious Food, Wonderful Service \n\n I recently went to Desert Jade for lunch and was welcomed with a friendly smile when I walked in the restaurant. I was seated almost immediately and greeted by my server with water and a smile. \n\nEverything was tasty and plentiful. The Mongolian beef was particularly good.  The Mongolian beef is delicately sliced, very lean, flavorful, and melts in your mouth. My fellow \""""yelpers\"""" this is Mongolian beef perfection. I couldn't find a single flaw, I just couldn't and now my mouth is watering.\n\nDesert Jade has very affordable prices and the portions are great.  The staff is incredibly nice, friendly, gracious and accommodating and the service is second to none. In addition, Desert Jade offers terrific lunch and dinner specials. \n\nOverall I was really happy with the quality, quantity, and the service that was given to me!",1
Ate here for the first time about 2 weeks ago.  I had the Mongolian beef and it was delicious.  We ate there close to closing time so there weren't too many people there.  However the people that did come were mostly Asians.  I'm not trying to sound racial or anything but if you have people of your own ethnicity coming to your restaurant to eat then you know it's got to be good! \nDelicious food and excellent service!,1
"I cannot in good faith recommend this restaurant.   This is definitely the low end of Chinese food for Phoenix.   Normally I'd try a place more than once, but, in this case... Not going to happen.",0
"Was a little leery about trying Desert Jade for dinner last night. The building on the outside looks old and the half lit sign was not inspiring confidence, but I have been craving Chinese and my hubby and I always go past it it and stare curiously.\n\nLets be clear here, this is NOT an authentic, or anywhere close Chinese restaurant. This is a good old fashioned American Chinese joint, keeping that in mind we tried the Sweet and Sour Pork, Singapore Rice Noodles and Sauteed Shrimp.\n\nThe food came out FAST, I mean in 10 minutes after ordering we had our first dish on the table. It was hot and fresh, no rewarmed in the microwave junk. The pork was lovely, big chunks of tender battered pork in that great artificial red sauce which was tangy with just the right amount of sweet. The pork was accompanied by nice sized chunks of pineapple and green peppers that still had some crunch, not cooked to oblivion.\n\nThe Singapore Rice Noodles came in a huge portion, probably enough to feed 4 people. Perfectly done thin rice noodles with lots of shrimp and pork tossed together with a wonderful curry sauce. Not at all greasy or over sauced. We took more than half of the dish home for delicious leftovers.\n\nThe shrimp dish consisted of a good sized plate of very lightly battered shrimp sauteed with chili peppers and large cut green onions. It looks deceivingly simple but has wonderful flavor much light salt and pepper shrimp but with much less mess as they don't need to be peeled. The server asked us how hot we wanted the dish so we went with a 5/10, we ended up with a nice blend of flavor and heat that was a gentle medium for us. \n\nThe service was fast and friendly, the restaurant itself is very clean, it looks like it recently got a new coat of paint. Overall for the price the food is quite a good deal.\n\nOh yes in response to another Yelpers review in where he noted all the elderly in the restaurant and wondered if there was a retirement home in the area. Yes there are like 3 of them in very close proximity!",1
"I love this place! Great Hot & Sour soup, excellent fried wontons and the staff is so nice. My boyfriend and I get take out from here all the time and the front lady is always very welcoming.",1
"This is our go-to \""""quickie Chinese\"""" food for lunch.  You can order and have great food in less than 5 minutes during the work week and the lunch menu is pretty inexpensive.  Beef & Broccoli, Sweet & Sour Chicken, and Tangerine beef are all great!",1
"Seriously, where's the flavor?  I went there for the first time yesterday and, based on previous review,s I was expecting something wonderful.  NOT!  First, I ordered wor wonton soup.  I had to add so much salt to get any flavor out of the broth.  Yes, there were plenty of vegetables and shrimp, but nothing had any flavor.  The \""""wontons\"""" were more like gnocchi.  Then came my chicken chow mein.  More bean sprouts than chicken and, again, needed so much salt.  UGH!  Needless to say I'll continue my search throughout the Valley for excellent Chinese food.",0
"It was the worst Chinese food I have ever had. I had the spicy beef with vegetables and my son had the Singapore noodles. My sauce was missing flavor as equally my veggies and beef were bland. Hospital food is better. The rice was cooked with too much water so it was mushy, so when I told the server he said he would get rice from a different pot. That means they have two types of rice and they serve the lowest quality first. The second bowl he brought was medium grade long grain rice. Don't eat here!",0
"Over all, I will not be going back. The best apart of the whole dinner was that the entire staff was very kind, and friendly. But NOTHING else would bring me back. The prices are too high, since the food was NOT good. If the prices were lower, I would consider the old \""""Well you get what you pay for!\"""" saying, but I paid $6 for a small bowl of egg drop soup, and it was very watered down and needed seasoning. Then I paid $11 for some chicken chow mien, it was ok, but the chicken was either old, or stringy (or something, it wasn't very good). The restraunt itself was clean, but freezing. I think they had the ac on.... but since the evenings lately have been in the 30's* everyone was already cold. I looked around and everyone was eating with there jackets, sweaters and hats still on. I was wearing my sweater & scarf! My waiter was a very nice guy, but over all, the food was sub par, and over priced, while the dinning room was uncomfortably cold.I could go on but I hate that my review is this negative already, since I think they really are good people.",0
"STAY AWAY AND FOR GOODNESS SAKE, DON'T TAKE YOUR CHILDREN!!!  My daughter was misdiagnosed and spent two years on a medication she didn't need!  Words cannot describe how angry I was when I found this out through a reputable allergist.  I suspect that they are receiving kickbacks from pharmaceutical companies, because we spent hundreds of dollars on equipment and medications (which they provided directly).  The staff is ambivalent at best, downright hostile at worst.  And don't get me started on the excessive costs and all the hassle with the insurance!",0
The WORST customer service experience I have ever had.\n They have no courtesy or manners what so ever.,0
"Good hole-in-the-wall place. Was recommended by some new friends I met in Arizona. They knew the owner and was highly-recommended. We went for dinner on a Monday night so it wasn't packed at all. Service was good, a tad slow, but we weren't in a rush.\n\nFood: was good. ordered a shrimp cerviche, fresh and tasty. 7 Mares, a flavorful and seafood meaty soup. To quench the thirst, I tried the Micheladas, a bloody mary type drink mixed with beer, a spicy treat. \n\nFrom the look of the local feel, this place seems like it'll be a great happy hour location to. Hope to find out one day when I visit AZ again.",1
Very good mexican food.  The kind I am used to.  Shrimp cocktail was really good.  I have never been to this part of town and it was a little sketchy but I'm still alive and I would go back.,1
"Boy, talk about HEAT!! Get ready to pant like a dog! The salsa had a different shade of color to it than the traditional red salsa. This was a bit dark orange/ brick red color. And boy was it HOTTTTTTT. Kicked my butt!!!!! It was so good I couldn't stop eating it. Even though I had tears and a runny nose. I ordered the Molcajete Marinero. It came with rice and beans. It was sizzling hot and mouth burning spicy. Just the way I like it! I'm not fond of octopus because it has a lingering after taste in my mouth. Next time I will have them omit the octopus. The red chili sauce in the bowl was very good but have something cold to drink handy because it can make you cry! I really enjoyed my entree but I think $18.25 was way too expensive.  My friend ordered Mixto Camaron y Pulpo. The portion was large, as it should be for $12.80. He said the flavor was good. The only thing that was disappointing is that it only had 4 shrimp in the entire bowl. The restaurant staff was very nice, accommodating, and informative. There are some authentic mexican restaurants that give us the feeling we are not appreciated there. Not, Marscos Acapulco. Everyone from the waitress to the cook made us feel welcome. I would like to return and enjoy another meal here. YUM!",1
"My first time here for lunch. I went with 2 other friends. \n\nWhat we had:\nAppetizer: artichoke and spinach dip with tortilla chips \nLunch: fish and chips, and their special of the day meatballs.\n\nWe got our appetizer and it was good. The fish and chips were a little on the greasy side, but what do you expect for fried fish and french fries. The meatballs... that's another story. They used a spice in it that had a very strong licorice taste (I think the spice is called anise). There were 4 meatballs for $7.95. I took a small bite off of one and almost gagged. I could not handle the licorice taste. I asked if I can substitute it for fish and chips and make it \""""to go\"""" as we were running out of time. When the check came, they did not take the meatballs off and asked the waitress about it. Come to find out that the OWNER said \""""JUST BECAUSE I DIDN'T LIKE IT, I STILL HAD TO PAY FOR IT!\"""". I WAS SHOCKED!!!!  I told her, then I didn't want the fish and chips. I only ordered a higher price item as not to walk out with only a $30 bill.  \n\nWe ended up leaving paying $46, $8.00 for the meatballs that I only had 1 bite out of! It's a good thing I ate my share of the artichoke dip or I would have STARVED!\n\nI WILL NEVER BE COMING BACK HERE AGAIN!!!!!",0
"So after an exhausting day the man and I decided we wanted to be waited on for dinner.  However we couldn't come up with a style of food we were hungry for.  Now, when this happens my boyfriend invariably reverts to his inexplicable love for TGI Fridays.  I don't really understand the infatuation.  Friday's is fine, I guess, but when there are so many other better options why bother?  Plus there isn't one remotely close to my house.  So i start rattling off other pub-ish type places in the area where he might have a similar (but better) experience.  We settled on Wally's.  I had been once before but this was his first time.\n\nWhen we walked in, the host gave us our choice of seating and we decided on a high top near the bar.  As we settled into our seats and took a look around, we agreed that the ambiance and decor are homey and welcoming without being obnoxious.  In fact, it sort of looks like a low key Friday's.  \n\nOur waiter came by promptly and took drink orders.  Wally's has a decent beer selection and the bf thought they had a nice whiskey selection as well.  We noticed how good the calamari looked as it was delivered to a nearby table and ordered that to start.  As we waited for it to arrive, we concentrated on our figuring out our entree orders.  I ultimately went with the chicken quesadilla off the appetizer menu and the bf ordered the Frisco burger.  The server was accommodating and helpful, making suggestions and answering questions as needed.  He specifically mentioned that the chipotle mayo on the burger was fantastic.\n\nWhen the calamari arrived, we dug in.  The calamari well well cooked, with crispy breading and tender meat.  The marinara it was served with though was underwhelming.  We sat for a minute wondering whether to send it back or just deal.  Then, my bf said, \""""I wonder how that chipotle mayo would be with the calamari?\""""  Genius.  We flagged down server and he agreed that the mayo sauce was great with the calamari.  In fact, it was a  vast improvement.  They should just serve both sauces with the calamari.  Or ditch the marinara altogether.  \n\nWhen our entrees arrived, bf was pleased with the mix of onion rings, fries and sweet potato fries served with the burger.The burger was cooked to order and similar to a patty melt.  My quesadilla, while not Mexican restaurant quality, was decent for the environment.  It was tasty and I appreciated the sides of sour cream, avocado and salsa it came with.  \n\nOur server was attentive throughout the meal and checked in on us occasionally.  He offered dessert, but we were too stuffed.  Overall, we had a great experience.  I enjoy Keegan's as a neighborhood pub spot, but I like Wally's better. We'll be back for sure.",1
"We rode our bikes here ther other night and had a wonderful time and dinner for two + 2 drinks for $25. The food was very fresh and the patio is great. The \""""hold in the wall\"""" feeling Nikki talks about is dead on! Try it out sometime when you just don't know where to go!",1
"Wally's is kind of hidden gem tucked away in a shopping center on 44th Street and Camelback.  There's nothing like an evening meal on their comfortable patio after the sun has set. The patio is dog friendly as well. I've been here a few times and really have enjoyed everything I have ordered; my favorite is the Cuban Sandwich. My wife loves the Chicken Sandwich with the Brie cheese.\n\nLast time I was there, they forgot to send a server to our table for about 10 minutes. The Manager took responsibility for the oversight and offered my wife and I dessert on the house. We decided to share a creme brulee, which was excellent. That was definitely a case of turning a lemon into lemonade in my book.\n\nIt's definitely been too long since I've been to Wally's.",1
"My family and I are regulars at Wally's because at Wally's, regulars are family.\n\nBeyond the deep, deep personal connection I have with the restaurant I can tell you that the food is unquestionably great and the service is always top-notch. (There are a few servers and bartenders who have been there since the place opened 10 years ago.) \n\nMy favorite menu items are as follows: 1) Cuban Panini 2) Frisco Burger 3) Meatloaf 4) Pot Roast 5) Spaghetti. The fact that Wally's can do all five of those things extremely well should tell you all you need to know.\n\nThere is something old school cool about a joint where the Proprietor is almost always present and Wally's is that place. He's the guy with the grey hair and beard who probably handed you your menu. Tell him I said hello and that the Price family loves him like their own.",1
I love the Vegetarian Burger they make here! So delicious! A really good menu and a very nice atmosphere! I recommend it!,1
"Okay, THIS place is the bomb-diggity!!! They are pretty reasonably priced for the amount of food they give you and oh... the food! Super delicious!! I've had a few different things there now and I'm NEVER let down!! Their French Onion soup is delicious and the cobb salad was outstanding! My ex always get their 4 cheese macaroni and LOVES it!!! You can NEVER go wrong with Wally's!!!!! :-)",1
"I have been to this place for drinks and possibly food over a year ago. It was time to stop by for a casual dinner. I was eating light this night so ordered a salad which said : field greens, apple, berry, fresh mozzarella, and I added chicken. This dish was an embarrassment to salads. Hardly any greens, maybe half a chix breast, and mozzarella u could barely notice. \n\nHusband had chix parm: nice size dish he liked it. \n\nThis is a cool place to have a drink but the food NO WAY. It is not memorable and there are too many other food places close by.",0
"Wally's bills itself as a neighborhood grill - it's in our neighborhood so we like to frequent it. The food is good and the portion sizes are enough to take some home and have the next day. I tried the french dip with prime rib for the first time and it was mighty good! I'm not a fan of liver and onions, but have been told that Wally's knows how to make it taste yummy. Great atmosphere, nice outside eating area, great menu selection. All around a good place.\n\nWe did have a strange occurance after our last visit. We went with friends and split the tab 50-50. While we were in the parking lot saying our goodbyes to our friends, the waiter came out & asked if everything was ok - if our experience was good. We all said yes, and he said he just wondered because when he gets a 10% tip, he'd like to know why. I know we gave him a nice tip - I have no idea what our friends tipped, but I thought it was incredibly rude that he would come out to question us! We've never had this experience at any eating establishment anywhere - I was really taken back. This is not indicitive of Wally's - but Wally, if you read this, please know this didn't set well with a \""""Wally's Club\"""" member.",1
"Happened to be in the neighborhood and this location fit the bill for lunch recently.  They have a nice (dog friendly too) patio with plenty of shade and greenery.  I like patio dining and this worked well.   Unfortunately our lunch was only fair.  I had a caprese salad - mozzarella was perfect as were the greens & balsamic dressing but the heriloom tomato was rock hard.  Nice idea but try to eat green tomato as one of the main features of a salad, not so good.  Shouldn't they atleast try to serve a partially ripened tomato?  I mean someone had to hack through this rock to put it on the plate.  Burger was good, nothing spectacular - accompanied by a side salad loaded with onions and some funky version of their bleu cheese dressing (lots of pepper).  \n\nOur waiter was so-so.  One of those guys that doesn't write anything down and doesn't remember anything you specially requested.  And forget about returning to the table to see how everything is after food was delivered.  We had to track HIM down.  \n\nMaybe this was an off day or perhaps I  ust ordered the wrong thing.  I might go back if I were in the area again - if only for the patio experience and I'm not particularly hungry.",0
"We are a group of 7 who call ourselves the FNF (Friday-Night-Foodies). We eat together nearly every Friday evening. We like good service and good food and are willing to drive anywhere in the Valley and pay for a great evening. We often go to Wally's on 44th and Camelback. \n\nWally's has neither the best food nor the best service of the restaurants on our FNF list, but it ranks high in terms of being the most consistent, predictable and dependable. It is also high on our list in terms of value for the money. The wait staff is competent, pleasant and accommodating. The food is darn good and reasonably priced. When we want an easy, decent meal in a relaxed environment without spending a fortune, Wally's is our go-to-place.\n\nOur favorites are the Chicken Vesuvius, Chopped Salad and the good old Pot Roast or Meat Loaf. The daily special fish entree is always enjoyable. I could not review Wally's without mentioning the burger. We have been to every \""""designer\"""" burger place in the Scottsdale and Camelback Corridor area. There isn't a better burger anywhere than the one at Wally's. If you get there before 6 pm, you can even get it on happy hour at a discount. \n\nSo, Wally's is a FNF favorite because the food, ambiance and service are good, consistent, and dependable and because you get a good deal overall. Well done Wally.",1
"This review is about rude, rude Wally. First off, as my 80 year old mother and I were coming in slowly, he said \""""hurry up, old lady.\""""  The food was ok, frankly not one thing to talk about.  A $10 - $14 burgers and salad kind of joint.  My son ordered the halibut special. The bill for a plate with some rice, green beans, and a piece of halibut was $26.95!!!!! I told Wally I thought that was too expensive for a restaurant like his. His response was, \""""I guess you haven't eaten in a restaurant lately.\"""" well, Wally, no way am I stepping back in yours.",0
"What a great neighborhood restaurant! The atmosphere is cozy and friendly, the food is tasty and the prices are reasonable. What more can you ask for? We came here for dinner and sat at the bar but will definitely take advantage of their spacious outdoor patio next time. I ordered the veggie burger with a honey glaze coat which was amazing! My husband got the French dip and I stole a delicious bite. I want to order that next time. The sides were the best because they provide a mix of regular fries, sweet potato fries and onion rings! Perfection!",1
"Wow! My first trip to Wally's .... and I got to meet Wally! Neat-O! \n\nNot only is he the bees knees he was hands on. I was, quite frankly, surprised by that. But more on that in a minute!\n\nTo frame my experience, I popped in on a Tuesday night during the dinner rush. One of our friends had hopped on over ASAP to nab a table. (Apparently this place is hopping. She was spot on!)\n\nIt's a really cute place that is friendly to all sorts of different folks. \n\nIf you want to watch the game? Sure! TV at the bar. \nFeel like eating at the bar? Yep!\nCasual dining? Absolutely.\nDinner date (where you want to impress)? YES. \n\nI was (not on a date) but did see a number of couples engaged in serious conversation over wine. It's not too loud of a place (at least on a Tuesday night) to foster intimate conversation. \n\nFor dinner I followed the menu's guidance (and then asked Wally himself). Chicken Vesuvius is w-o-n-d-e-r-f-u-l! Chicken medallions, artichoke hearts, kalamata olives, 'cider' smoked bacon (HOH MY) with plenty of herbs and spices. My meal was served with a hearty portion of salad and (HOH MY) horse radish mashed potatoes.\n\n1) The chicken was cooked to perfection. Not a hint of dryness!\n2) The chicken wasn't bathed in oil. That sounds like a terrible way to describe it, but, I didn't feel like I was tossing a gym session out the window. \n\nThat being said, note that portions are on the very [very] generous side. I took 2/3rd of it home.\n\nRight. So about Wally, the impeccable service and a delightful experience... Let's see...Our server described the specials with such delight that I only wished I was going off menu. But no! I wanted something \""""regular\"""" on the menu. Wally was incredibly helpful in helping this first timer navigate the full menu. (Alas, the house was out of the nightly special of ribs.) Wally has a comedic sense of timing. Watch out!\n\nOk, so what's the deal with Wally's fantastic beard? Were you thinking Ernest Hemingway? Why yes! In fact, Wally and his son enter a contest every year for the best E. Hemingway beard in FL. \n\n[Drum Roll] They are 2013 crowned winners!\n\nThis is a great spot if you're popping in to AJ's. Loved it!",1
"The first time that I went into this place I thought that it was okay. I did not feel like it lived up to the rave reviews but it was good enough to bring me back to enjoy some food and drink with an old friend.  That time I had ordered their shrimp cocktail while I waited for my friend to arrive, I was starving! As I was eating, the owner (I assume) came up to introduce himself and asked if I live in the area (most of the patrons do)...as I turned back towards the bar to eat my very last jumbo shrimp, the Katie Perry look alike grabbed my food and dumped it in the trash! She never even asked if I was finished. I asked her if she decided that I was done eating and then she asked if I wanted another shrimp from the kitchen but I felt awkward at that point and told her no. She still brought me one lonely shrimp on a huge plate with no cocktail sauce. The sauce is what makes the shrimp cocktail. My friend and I then ordered their spinach dip.  The dip was brought out and as the plate was lowered to the bar, my chips were sliding off onto the bar and she just scooped them back on to the plate. I personally was not thrilled about that. I scooped some spinach up on to my dirty chip, blew on it a little and took a bite. This dip was the hottest (heat wise) thing that I have ever had in my mouth. I would compare it to biting the rack in a broiler.  I was never warned that they heat their dip up so hot. I guarantee the work of a microwave! I burned myself so bad that my mouth was peeling and bleeding. It took over a week of peroxide rinses, colloidal silver rinses and salt water rinses to heal my mouth. My mouth is actually scarred inside! This burned me so terribly that my teeth were sore, my jaw hurt and even my sinuses on that side of my mouth hurt. When I stopped in to tell the brunette bartender about my burn and I advised that they should warn people about how hot they make it, she replied with \""""Well, don't scarf your food down, let it cool first.\"""" Totally rude, offensive and bad customer service with a reply like that. That same night that I burned my mouth, my friend was using their hot sauce to spice up her chip and the bartender came over and started twisting the lid back on without asking if she was done and my friend had to stop her from taking it away. She clearly has issues with letting people finish their meal. When it came to the bill she had to ask us how many drinks we had because she wasn't keeping track... It seriously was not a lot of drinks to keep track of either. I think this place would be OK if it wasn't for this bartender. I did order a salad on a separate occasion (when I warned her about the hot dip) and that proved to be disappointing as well, way too much dressing and she kept giving me a hard time for not drinking during my work hour. Booooooo!!!",0
"Thank god for the delicious food, because the poor service I've received from Shannon on numerous occasions for take-out would have deterred me from coming back a long time ago.",1
"Stopped in during happy hour for a light bite and a drink. Sat at the bar and ordered a glass of their house Cab. With one other person at the bar, you'd think the service would be reasonable. The only other time I saw the bartender was when my glass was empty. I ordered another thinking she'd offer me a menu at least...never happened!! So I paid requested my bill and went somewhere else to eat. Btw, my bill for 2 glasses of \""""house\"""" wine during happy hour was more than $15!!! Other servers appeared to be much more customer-focused.",0
"We wanted to like Wally's as we live close and like to eat out often. But we have gone there a few times now and we have not had a good experience.  The food is ok, but the service and ambience leave a lot to be desired.  We like to sit at the bar to keep it simple, but the bartender couldn't wait for the night to end. A. request for water was ignored, as well as just ignoring us in general.  We looked around and the servers seemed to be staring at customers hoping they would just leave.  No one greeted us coming in, and true to form, no one thanked us on our way out.  We like to eat out and we prefer to stay close to home, but we will travel farther to go to a restaurant that wants our business.",0
"Wally's is my good ole go-to! It seems that there are very few decent straight up American restaurants in the Biltmore/Arcadia area. Whenever I'm not sure what I'm in the mood for, or don't want to be bothered with a hustle & bustle type place, Wally's it is! \n\nDon't expect to order healthy here, their menu is more on the side of comfort food, that being said I've never had a bad meal. The portions are very generous, and the prices are reasonable. The service here is so welcoming, they treat you as if you've been coming here for years. They have great sangria and lots of decent beer on tap to go with their delicious food. My favorite dish so far has been the Prime Rib dip, it's fantastic and full of flavor, and they also have awesome fries (a mix of sweet potato and regular). This place is totally worth the cheat! I highly recommend Wally's, as it's a great local restaurant.",1
Got the gyuere and slab bacon s'mac. It was AMAZBALLS. There are about a dozen other things I want to try but so far so good. I can't wait to try something else.,1
Really some of the best food and ambiance you will find.  We have been regulars at Wally's for more than 7 years and meet up with friends for dinner there at least twice each month.  It can be a little loud inside when it's busy but the outside seating is terrific as well!,1
"Can years of good service and food be off set by one HORRIBLE evening? Maybe... Went to Wally's with group of 5 people. The food was Wally's standard but the service was really bad. The server was rude, un-accommodating and slow. She forgot things (like a salad) and started invoking \""""new rules\"""" about taking more than 3 credit cards for a group (even though equally split). She also lectured us on how she would apply the Wally's dicount card. It wasn't so much about the money, it was about the awful way she made us feel. If they want to discontine the discount cards, do it - don't come up with a bunch of arbitrary rules at the last minute... that just ruins things. \nWally's faces new competition in the neighborhood and if they want to stay in business they need to focus on service and keeping their long standing clients happy. The food is never the BEST or  WORST in the valley but the local feel and comfortable service are the big draw. Without that, there is no reason to go there. \nAlthough we've eaten at Wally's at least once per week for more than 5 years, sadly, it will be quite some time before we return. Phoenix resturants compete in a service industry and when service is gone there is little reason to stick around- there are too many other, good options. \nI'm giving my review a 2 rating because the food was OK. Based on service, I'd give it a zero!\nWe're looking forward to Steak 44 and The Henry is wonderful. Wally, bye bye for now. Clean up your act and maybe we'll be back... maybe.",0
Wally`s is my number one go to place in Phoenix to eat and bring people to when they are visiting. I go to Phoenix a few times a month and I frequently find myself eating here.  Their Gruyere and slab bacon s` mac is to die for. Probably my favorite Mac and cheese ever. And I eat a lot of Mac and cheese. Super good atmosphere for a date and they have great service. They were awesome to us last night and they were busy.  It was Valentine's and we still got timely and great service. Love Wallys!,1
"Visited last nite after a brief stint at nearby gym.  We sat on the patio,  Great service, good food.  I had NY strip Caesar salad, with martini.  Steak was done perfectly.   GF had Cobb salad with white wine.  \nWe hardly noticed the 3 pregnant women with the 3 toddlers running all over :).  Can't begrudge them for wanting good food!",1
"While visiting Phoenix we happened upon this place and were pleasantly surprised at how good the burgers tasted!  \n\nIt was a nice evening so we sat outside (coming from the snow we had this winter, sitting outside was something I didn't think would ever happen again).  \n\nThe menu was pretty extensive, I think anyone in your party should be able to find something to please them.  Usually I would expect with such a large menu the food would be just okay.  But not this place, at least not as far as the burgers.\n\nI ordered the buttons and bleu burger and my boyfriend ordered bacon cheddar burger.  We both ordered our burgers medium rare and they were cooked perfectly!  There was a ton of mushrooms and bleu cheese on mine and lots of bacon and cheddar on his.  So much so, that he was able to share some bacon with me.  \n\nThe burgers came with a mixture of regular fries and sweet potato fries (my favorite).  I loved the idea of mixing them so you don't have to decide on one or the other.  \n\nOverall, the food was delicious, the prices were fair (especially for amount of food) and outside sitting was perfect!  If ever in Phoenix again, I will definitely go back to this place.",1
"Taylor's is a consistently wonderful place for breakfast... probably my favorite. The mimosas are more champagny than juice-y, which I obviously enjoy. The servers have always been sufficient, if not friendly and kind. There's not a single thing I dislike about Taylor's, really. Even the children that are occasionally scattered about seem well-behaved. Maybe this is Stepford breakfast, who knows.",1
"Very good place for breakfast & lunch tucked away in the crowded shops at 44th & Camelback.  I kinda found this place on accident.  I meant to just run into AJs and grab a salad to go, but was forced to park basically across the driveway from Taylor's, and, being closer, I opted to go there instead.  \n\nTaylor's is open 6-4ish (I couldn't really tell, they probably just changed the hours and scratched off the hour number on the door), and they serve breakfast all day- well, all day they're actually open- which is always good with me.  \n\nI was in the mood for corned beef, and , bingo, there it was.  Nice mound of lean tasty beef with melty cheese (no saurkraut or thousand island, please.).  And the bread- oh the bread- grilled to be crispy on the edges but still soft inside.  How in the hell do they do it?  I don't know, but I'm in love.",1
"If you enjoy  the one on 44th street, you will love the new location in Scottsdale. The decor is beautiful! I realy love the bar top. It lites up.\nI had some of the best french toast ever!! This location is owned by\na father and son team. I have the pleasure of knowing them both, they are hard working, and give great care in bringing to their customers tasty, healthy and generous portions. I will definitely dine there again.",1
Everyone seems to love this place. I thought it was just 'aight. I had lunch and apparently breakfast is where it's at - so I'll have to go back again.\n\n4 stars because it did not piss me off. More later...,1
"We chose this place for breakfast this morning because of the wonderful reviews on yelp.  I was certain it was going to be one of my new favorite places. \n\nWe entered into a brightly painted orange restaurant and stood at the hostess stand for a few minutes waiting for the hostess to finish flirting with the server and notice us.  She clearly didn't want to be there and could care less where we sat, so opted for the table in the window.  \n\nWe sat and waited and waited and waited.  Tables that were sat after us already had their drinks and they were not busy.  Finally I tried to get the attention of the hostess who was standing half asleep at the hostess stand, mouth open wide, eyes half closed.  A few minutes later we finally had a server.\n\nOur server was not very friendly.  I don't even think she said good morning.  We ordered.  Tables sat after us already got their food and we finally got our drinks.  She bought out 2 cups of coffee, but I did not order coffee so I made her take that back. \n\nOur food finally arrived.  We ordered french toast which came with strawberries, bananas and a cinnamon sauce, eggs benedict with crab cakes and two orders of country potatoes. \n\nBreakfast was pretty good.  I enjoyed my crab cake and the cinnamon sauce on the french toast was a nice added touch.  The potatoes were not good, they had WAY too much pepper on them, I couldn't even eat them.  Gary ate a few of his after he drowned them in ketchup.\n\nWe never saw our server again.  We got a water refilled after we finished our meal.  AND THE WAIT BEGAN.  We waited and waited and waited for our check.  Tables that were sat when we finished eating had already finished their food.  We never saw our waitress. I guess we were her only table, if not I felt bad for her other tables as well. \n\nFinally some guy brought us our check and tried to drop it off and run, I said WAIT and gave him my card and said, \""""If I don't give this to you now it may be 20 more minutes before we see someone again\""""\n\nBecause I didn't look at the bill first when he brought it back I didn't notice until after I paid that they charged me $12.05 for the eggs benedict when their menu actually said $10.50.  I didn't say anything...  I just left a sad tip.\n\nWe were there for OVER an hour, they had lots of empty tables, and we only saw our server once.\n\nGary and I always over tip, because he and his family owned restaurants in the Valley for 35 years.  He has spent a lot of time being a chef and serving tables.  We know that when food comes out wrong, it's probably not the servers fault, and things happen, so we still tip well.  TODAY, I felt like we were invisible and I have no idea where our server disappeared to for the hour.  \n\nWe drove by Over Easy, La Grande Orange and IHOP to try this place.  We probably will not be back... unless we decide to give it a second try on jazz night... I do love jazz.",0
"Breakfast foods are the best foods and, I'm pleased to report, Taylor's does the genre proud.\n\nI've dined here twice, both in the morning.  Taylor's is located on the NE corner of 44th St and Camelback and, if you want to find it quickly, you should turn into the complex when you see Cork 'N Cleaver.  Otherwise, prepare to drive around in circles wondering if the map on Yelp was wrong.  It's a little hard to spot at first.\n\nInside, you'll find a cute little cafe with cute little tables and a cute little patio.  It's so cute I could just squeeze it.  Seriously though, it feels exactly like a breakfast joint should.\n\nBut let's get to the good stuff: the food.  I'm a big fan of morning grub and Taylor's certainly delivers.  My first visit, I had a chorizo and egg dish that was perfectly cooked and reasonably priced.  More recently, I had the poached eggs with salmon which was a giant mouthful of delicious.  If I remember correctly, all the poached egg dishes were priced the same regardless of meat choice, so I had to make it count.\n\nI did knock off one star for the lackluster service we received on our most recent visit.  Still, if you're in the mood for some breakfast eats and the Good Egg sounds about as exciting as a Coldplay mixtape, give Taylor's a try.",1
"After so may 4 and 5 star reviews I decided to give Taylor's another chance after my first visit, thinking perhaps I just had a bad experience and this place really is as great as everyone raves.. So now on to my second dining adventure and I am still not impressed. \nThe place is cute, it has a great charm and ambiance, really a perfect setting for a causal breakfast or lunch. The food is decent, but nothing exceptional and extremely overpriced.. My first time I had the huevos rancheros and they really should have been called huevos gringos. The dish consisted of beans folded into a wheat tortilla with a fried egg and very bland tomatillo sauce, what side do you get for 9.25$ - chips...needing more than chips I added a side of potatoes ($3),  I split this dish and was charged ($2) without even being asked.. Bringing the total dish to $14.25.. Get real for breakfast? .  I compare this dish to Harlow's huevos rancheros.. there is $7.95 and comes with potatoes and beans and tortillas..\nMy second visit I ordered the \""""create your own omelet\"""" for $10.75, this seemed high for an omelet but I went with it.. It was pretty good, but again the side... toast or a bagel, order the potatoes ($3) and another split plate charge ($2) without being asked.. Let me rant on this one for a moment.. They charge me $2 to cut my omlettee in half.. The bagel already comes sliced. LAME, bring it on one plate and I can cut it myself..it is not like we got double portions.. very annoying. So now the omelet is $15.95 ridiculous. Add an OJ.. $5 bucks! When most places have $3 mimosas on Sundays I found paying $5 for an OJ ridiculous. So in all Taylor's food is decent, but with so many good and lower priced options in the nearby area, I don't seem myself going back.",0
"Meh. Went a couple times too, just to be sure. Primarily due to the better Yelp reviews preceding this one. But now I'm sure. The food's not bad, but it's not that good, either - and overpriced for what it is, which is pretty standard breakfast fare. Service was dismal both trips. Barely got greeted, then long waits between waitress visits before she disappeared completely. I like the d\u00e9cor - it's a neat little place with cool artwork, but it's not enough to make up for the service (or lack thereof) and the overpriced food. Until I find a better place in my hood I'll stick to Acacia Cafe, which is just the opposite really - no atmosphere, but better food at a better price and friendly service - which are more important in my book. Oh, and what's with the charge for splitting a meal? My date and I often share a dish - we would have been happy to eat off the same plate, but we weren't even given the option, just charged 2 bucks for somebody to cut our omelet in half. WTF?",0
"Ok...I know I may cause a ruckus with my next musing....\nMatt's Big Breakfast or Taylor's Cafe?  Long lines or easy seating?  Crowded, on-top-of -you, loud atmosphere or just loud?  Ordinary food with buzz or ordinary food without the buzz? Easy pick for me -- Taylor's Cafe over Matt's Big Breakfast.  \n\nI love breakfast!  I do.  And, more than that, I love comfort food breakfast's -- no foo foo gourmet breakfast for me -- save that for dinner.  I think Taylor's Cafe is just fine.  Plus - they know how to cook \""""crispy\"""" bacon. You have to ask for it - but it never comes out burnt.  They have interesting omlettes too if you are in the mood.  And you know what?  For a girl who likes a thick stack of french toast - I really like their oatmeal.  Odd, right?  Well it's darn good with fresh fruit on top.    \n\nSo, while Talyor's Cafe may not have the buzz of a Matt's Big Breakfast - I think the food satisfies my craving and I never have to wait in line.  When the weather gets cooler, go on Sunday, bring your New York Times (sorry-that's the East Coaster in me coming out) and sit out on the patio.\n\nService is adequate, but not outstanding.  I'm giving my rating to the food and atmosphere.",1
"Blindly went to Taylor's with a friend on Sunday (had I known where we were going I would have recommended someplace else). I decided to be open minded and give them another try. I ordered an iced tea and the waffle, he got the poached eggs with hollandaise and a coffee. The server took our orders and returned with an OJ for me, forgivable offense - she took it away and brought me back a an iced tea. \n\nThen the incredible wait began... An hour later we finally flagged someone down to inquire on our food. He said he would check for us.. We never saw him again. There was a party of 3 and a party of 6 next to us, they both ordered after us and were almost done with their meal... Both parties were complaining about missing items, I overheard a bagel, a side of fruit and a waitress had all disappeared. At this point I was ravenous and we again went to find our server.. She finally brought our food, and it was horrible. The waffle was dry and tasteless and the poached eggs were drenched in hollandaise, thick greasy hollandaise that looked and tasted like it had been sitting on the plate for ages. \n\nOur horrible breakfast experience lasted 1:40 minutes. Ridiculous. I will not be returning, 3 strikes Taylor's you're out. I left a Yelp card on the table, hopefully they read this an make some improvements.",0
"Looked at the rating and thought it would be exciting....but nothing at all special.  The huevos rancheros SUCKED.  Very bland, nothing great at all.  We also got some dish that was mushrooms, cheese and spinach on a bialy (but they were out so it was on a english muffin)  not bad.  But for like $10 I and tons of good reviews, I would expect more than just tortillas from a bag on the side of over easy eggs and like 2 pieces of avocado.",0
"A solid brunch place! \n\n- Busy but not TOO busy, with no wait on a late Saturday morning\n- Coffee mugs are ginormous and plenty to last through the meal\n- Tons of choices too chose from. Thoroughly enjoyed my huevos rancheros. Three overeasy eggs atop a whole wheat tortilla with refried beans and salsa....I'm salivating just thinking about it. Other great options range from crepes to amazing looking omelettes, even breakfast burritos\n- Prices are reasonable for brunch: $8-$13 per plate\n- Service was attentive and friendly, although I felt slightly rushed with the busboys hawking over me\n\nMinus one star because we ended up waiting pretty long for our food to come out...makes no sense especially when neighboring tables get served faster? \n\nWill definitely come back again and look forward to trying other items on their interesting menu.",1
"Decided to try out taylors for breakfast today. I started with the fresh squeezed orange juice. This is the pulpiest fresh orange juice I've ever had. It was great. Then my dish came out I ordered the Asian crab omelet. It was very good it came with crabmeat, green onions, avocado, and cheese. It was excellent all the ingredients seemed very fresh. This is a nice new find for breakfast in my area.",1
"\""""I will go back to Taylor's the next time I feel like having someone hit me in the face with an orange while I hand them $5\"""" was my facebook status update right after I ate at Taylor's on Valentine's Day morning. The girlfriend and I had been planning to go to Over Easy that morning but by the time we got out of bed the line was immense. So we drove to IHOP...which was packed. I grabbed my phone and Yelp (oh dear me) told me Taylor's was a good place for brunch.\n\nWalked in and the place was pretty much empty (it's kinda sad when IHOP is fuller than you are but that may just be a sign of the economy). The inside was nice, full of well-dressed people happily eating breakfast so the girlfriend and I snagged a couple menus and sat down. As it was a Sunday morning and I hadn't had any coffee yet I wasn't paying much attention to the menu. I ordered a spinach and goat cheese omelet, some hash browns, bacon, and coffee; the girlfriend ordered some pancakes and OJ. The coffee came (GIANT mugs which I really like) and the waiter seemed pretty cool. I was thinking all was right with the world and then.....the food came...\n\nThe omelet was not so much cooked, mostly spinach, and severely lacking on the goat cheese. The hash browns were those typical of any diner in America, except greasier and cold. The bacon? Paper-thin and miniscule. My GF's food was equally unimpressive and then...the bill came...\n\nIt was like $46 for the 2 of us!! I knew the bacon would be extra but has browns? For like $4? Really?!? $5 for OJ? It was good but, like I said before, seeing it on the bill was a bit like being gobsmacked with an orange while handing over a fiver. Should've just waited in the huge line at Over Easy",0
"Literally one of the worst dining experiences ever. \n\nThis restaurant is in our neighborhood and it looked so cute, I was very excited to get some breakfast and enjoy a beautiful day on their patio. We ordered after waiting for 15 minutes our waiter to even come to our table, we told him we were ready to order and he told us he would get us our drinks first. After waiting another 15 minute to get our ice tea, he finally took our order. Our food was brought to us by a women who looked like she clearly hated her job, she slammed the food on the table and walked away. \n\nAs I went to take my first bite I noticed a long hair draped across my plate. ewwww. I could not find our waitress so I waited 5 minutes and had to flag someone else down, who apologized took my plate and walked away. Our waitress came back another 5 minutes later and asked where my food was, I told her what happened and she apologized and instead of offering to replace us, she told us she would get our check. wtf. \nI was blown away, I did not make a stink because I have worked in the service industry and I know you don't get anything when your rude.... but I wish I would have, because the owner or manager (I'm guessing)brought the bill and left a to go box for my sister. and that was that... they didn't even offer to replace my meal or comp it. \n\nThis place is truly a joke, I will never go back.",0
"Well, this is probably going to be my last AZ review for a very long time.  Expect a slew of Seattle reviews instead. :o)\n\nTaylor's Cafe was pretty awesome despite the fact that we had a little trouble finding it.  It sure is tucked away in a mass of twists and turns of pavement and stucco.  In any event, we found it and it was relatively busy.  Since there was only two of us we were seated immediately right by the door.  I kind of expected my waiter to be douchey just because of the location and the way he was \""""styled,\"""" but he was actually pretty awesome.\n\nAfter running through the menu I kept finding omelets that were almost exactly what I wanted, save one or two ingredients.  When our waiter came back and I told him my dilemma, he told me to just make something up.  Sweet!  I ended up ordering an egg white omelet with asparagus, mushrooms, and cheese.\n\nThe food came out faster than I expected and I was certainly not going to complain about that.  Obviously my omelet was close to perfection because it was exactly what I wanted at the moment.  It was delicious and HUGE!  I couldn't even finish it!  To make a lovely breakfast experience even better, my Diet Cokes were continually topped off without me having to ask.  Now that is service.\n\nI would totally come here again, if I still lived in AZ, but the location is kind of obnoxious and the dining area is a bit cramped.  Overall, a really great stop for breakfast.",1
"I've visited Taylor's Cafe off and on over the last few years, it's been months since I've been in but finally decided to write a little something. \nTaylor's is tucked away among a few other local businesses. You may need to look around to actually find it. Hint: park in the back parking lot/east parking lot, you'll have no problem spotting it from there.\n\nGo for the fresh squeezed Orange Juice. They squeeze it per glass, and go for the Victor Ostrovsky Art, and also if you're a fan of supporting local businesses. Give up on IHOP and Denny's, forget the \""""fad\"""" \""""big breakfast\"""" places and give a neighborhood place a try.\n\nI've generally visited early in the morning, before the \""""brunch crowd\"""" and have had exceptional service and food.",1
"It's such a beautiful day to eat outside at Taylor's Cafe!  The view of Camelback mountain is gorgeous!  \n\nLOVE, LOVE, LOVE my server JC.  He always remembers my name and calls me the cutest pet names.  Always happy to freshly squeeze my OJ (what a man haha) and knows I need my huge cup of hot brimming coffee.  \n\nToday, I was craving an egg/bacon/jalape\u00f1o/salsa with no cheese burrito.  It was perfectly cooked and juicy (yum)! Instead of their perfectly browned hash browns (the longing can you feel it lol); I had fresh fruit which was great.  \n\nOnce again, love JC for his attentiveness & always feeling he looks forward to seeing me.  Rest of staff and the food is always fab!",1
Service was slow..staff was inattentive and nothing was done when we complained.won't be back.,0
"Went to Taylor's Cafe for a fear that the line at LGO and Over Easy would be too long.  I wish I would have waited in line.\n\nThe place was pretty empty so you would have thought our sever would have been a little more attentive. \n\nMy cousin ordered scrambled eggs with an english muffin and they came out how she had asked.\n\nI ordered the french toast which I was highly disppointed in.  First, it had raisins in it-which it didn't state on the menu.  Secondly, it was severely undercooked and runny in the middle.  I had to sit and stare at it's grossness (yeah I know that isn't a word) so long that by the time our waitress came to check on us I didn't want a new one so I ordered just an english muffin so I didn't have to leave starving.\n\nDisppointing and I don't think I'll return.",0
"We used to go to Taylor Cafe all the time, but haven't been in a while.  Man, what a difference- and not in a good way.\n\nIt is unseasonably cool in Phoenix and Vincent's isn't having their brunch experience, so we decided to go back to Taylor Cafe.  There were several less than pleasant surprises.  First off, they no longer have a liquor license and thus no Mimosas or Bloody Marys.  That was a minor issue for us, but worth mentioning on a Saturday morning brunch.  I ordered a cup of coffee, some scrambled eggs with cheese for my hungry toddler, and we looked at the menu.  \n\nIt seemed to have gotten much larger and there were some new interesting items.  I loved the eggs benedict before, and ordered it again.  My husband ordered the crepes.  We anticipated our meals.\n\nMy daughter's eggs came out almost within seconds.  Shocked, I saw it wasn't just eggs, but hashbrowns and fruit.  It was also NOT warm.  That surprise was a $9 meal.\n\nWhile waiting for our meal, I drank most of my coffee.  The server asked if I'd like more coffee to heat up my cup.  He took my cup, which I though was odd, and brought it back with warm, steaming coffee.  Yay!  Upon getting the bill, I learned there was no such things as refills and I was charged for a second cup.  \n\nLastly, our food was delivered.  My eggs benedict was not warm...again!  What is with cool food?  There wasn't enough hollandaise sauce, and honestly, it just wasn't that tasty.  My husband thought his crepes were just ok- not bad, but not flavorful.  Our last surprise:  when the bill arrived and we spent $45 on at best a mediocre breakfast, we were less than pleased.\n\nThe only bright spot- our server was friendly and did his best.  \n\nWe will not go back.  This was just one disappointment after another.",0
This will be quick and simple. I just went to Taylor's Cafe to purchase a gift certificate and server informed me that only a manager could  complete the transaction. That's a huge big time FAIL! Thank you for that  waste of time.,0
Decent food for the most part.  I went on a Saturday morning with an expectation of the place being overly crowded but surprisingly it wasn't. Great!! The downside is we sat for 15 mins without an acknowledgement...I was not pleased. Had we been served in a more courteous and timely manner my review may be higher because I did enjoy my food.  Great portions and very fresh. I would go again and possibly consider revising my review.,0
"It's true...I have experienced better, much better.  I really want to like this place, but both times I've eaten here I have been unimpressed.  I ordered a veggie burrito with a side of fruit and some salsa.  Ugh, first off, the avocado that came with the dish was old, not old like it could have been made into some tasty guac...it was dark and tasted like it should have gone into a compost bin rather than my mouth.  Second, the fruit looked as though it had been cut (or taken out of it's package) many days prior to hitting my plate, so I didn't even bother eating it.  Lastly, the freaking salsa looked so pale and gross that I just gave up on the meal entirely.  I was really disappointed with their obvious lack of care when it came to the quality of food they were sending out.  In no way would I have ever sent any of that food out had it been my restaurant.  The server was nice enough and the coffee mug was huge, but I won't be back, sorry kids...I gave you a second try and you came up short again.",0
"It is were possible to give this restaurant zero stars, I would. I have been here 4 times in the past year in the hope that the service would improve.  I had first tried Taylor's several years ago and remember the food being good, but having very bad service. We recently moved close to the restaurant and are looking for a locally-owned breakfast place.  I am not usually such an optimist, but the local is right by our house. \n\nThe menu is very large and the food has always been fine, nothing great, but the service absolutely terrible.  Not bad, terrible. Every time. All four times.  The wait staff is incredibly slow to take orders, bring drinks and food, and worst of all, after serving food, never check back to see if you need anything or offer drink refills. \n\nI cannot tolerate such poor service and will not return.  Trust me, you can find a better breakfast or lunch place.",0
"I love our little neighborhood corner. AJ's, Wally's, Healy Bea, and little hidden gems like Taylor's. My only mistake is not trying Taylor's sooner -- not surprising, though, given the overabundance of breakfast choices in Arcadia.\n\nWe've been in three or four times now and each time has been excellent. Most notably awesome is the service: prompt, attentive, gracious, accommodating. My SO and I are used to picking off the same plate or awkwardly dumping half the meal onto another plate when we ask to share something. Not here -- our shares came out pre-split. Very nice touch.\n\nThe menu is ginormous and slightly overwhelming... even for a mushroom-phobic vegetarian. Everything I've had has been quite good - a solid 4/5. Servings are super sized (hence our sharing). Minus a wee part of a star because the coffee is very Starbucks-esque: dark, burnt, and puts hair on your chest. I just like my coffee like I like my men: pale, sweet, and weak. Heh. Minus another shred of a star for being a little pricey, and lastly, minus a tiny fraction of a star for the annoying car alarm that kept going off in the parking lot. EVERY. TIME. WE'RE. THERE. Same one.",1
"I can't believe I never knew about this place until now?!\n\nI went for breakfast the other morning and thoroughly enjoyed my experience!  The atmosphere is really comfortable and we enjoyed our table completely surrounded by windows!\n\nThe latte was good - they obviously do not use a thermometer, so it was a little hot - but still tasted good.  I got it in a \""""for here\"""" cup and was offered a \""""to go\"""" cup when I was leaving - nice touch!\n\nI love how early they open - 6am every day!  I always feel like I'm waiting around for something to open for breakfast on weekends, so it's good to know that Taylor's is an option.\n\nI had the eggs benedict with prosciutto and it was divine!  A really fantastic hollandaise sauce (which I am known to be picky about).  Hash browns were delicious too.  The portion was so big I got to take half home for leftover breakfast the next day!\n\nA nice option for a neighborhood breakfast - I'll be back!",1
"This cute place is tucked in the back of the plaza (walking distance to AJ's).  When I got there it was starting to get packed.  Thank goodness M was there a few mins earlier than me.  I was quickly greeted by the server and he took my drink order.  \n\nI ordered the country ham served on a croissant with melted cheddar and mozzarella cheese, served with a side of hash browns.  And had to order a single buttermilk pancake.  Everything was very good.  The server was good.  \n\nCons - the table was so small, our plates did not fit, they had to remove some stuff off the table.  And the chairs are not comfy.",1
"Breakfast!  Love the fact they are open at the crack of dawn.  The service was ok.  The table was very small with seats that will make you uncomfortable.  I got the \nEggs Benedict with spinach, bacon, tomato and avocado.  The server was nice to have them take off the avocado that I guess looked funny to him however, didn't really appreciate the extra charge of $2.50 for 2 slices of tomatoes.  The plate was cold and the eggs were luke warm.  The spinach was on the bottom of the plate and not layered on the muffin and looked like it was taken out of the frig and plopped onto the plate.  Not cooked at all!  Place was pretty busy throughout the morning, which is great for a small place however, need to step up on the food I think.",0
"RIP Taylor's! Somehow our friendly neighborhood breakfast spot morphed overnight into \""""The Daily Bistro\"""". Gone is the impeccable service, unassuming but expansive menu, and outstanding food. Now we have a truncated, trendified menu, spotty service, and incorrectly cooked food. What used to be a beautiful relaxing patio is now tainted with unnecessarily loud techno dance music. \n\nW. T. F.!!! No bueno. We are sad.",0
"Broke a pair of perscription sunglasses at the hinge.  Costco referred me to this place.  They did the repair by afixing new temples.  When I got them out into the sun, they didn't match the frames...the frames were black so it wasn't like it was some freaky color or pattern to match...just black.  When I took them back in to remedy the situation I was informed it was the best that they could do.\n\nA few weeks later the screw came out of the hinge, so I took it back.  I was informed that the policy of the store was not to do any repairs without charging for it....even resetting a screw, which I supplied.  \n\nHow much could it be to reset a screw you might ask? Would you believe $20.00!  I prefer to select who I let screw me, and this dump ain't one of them....",0
"I lost the screw in my glasses.  I went to COSTCO and they could not fix them and gave me a card for this place.  He told me I needed a new arm because the hinge was cracked; however, I had already put in a temporary screw and did not see what he saw.  He wanted $38.00 to fix them.  I decided to get a second opinion and went around the corner to an optical shop and he said I only needed a screw and fixed them for nothing.",0
"The spring on the right arm of my glasses broke when I squished my glass case in my teeny tiny gym bag. I was referred to The Frame Doctor by another eyeglass store. It was a little hard to find and I ended up parking next door and walking over.\n\nThe arm on my glasses had to be welded to the glasses so there is no longer a spring and the arm always flops down. I don't like that, but was told I had no choice. I waited while my glasses were fixed, reading Yelp reviews on my smart phone. I would have rated five stars had I not been charged $38 for the repair, but at least I can wear my glasses again.",1
Friendly professional service.\nIn from out of town and was provided with the needed services in a professional manner.\nHighly recommended!,1
This guy totally bait and switched me. I went in and he told me 50 dollars and I thought that was high so I went and called my insurance to see if it would be cheaper to just get new frames. I went back in and said ok I will do it. Then I pulled out a 10% discount card and then he told me 69 but he will do it for 50. I thought that was pretty unethical.  I told him I would pay 45 which would be his orginal quote plus my 10% off. He refused.,0
"Please note that I went to The Shoe Shop to repair two leather jackets-so I can't speak to their shoe repair services.\n\nI had two leather jackets with tears on them. One down a seam and the other on the arm(not on a seam). The gentleman that helped us was very short and rushed when quoting us a price. After being a bit flustered and agreeing to the $80 for both jackets to be repaired, we left. He told us we should expect to have our jackets fixed a week from when we dropped them off.\n\nThree days later we got the call that the jackets were done. (Which was a plus as the turnaround time was quicker than originally quoted). When I picked up the jackets the lady behind the counter was much nicer and more accommodating than the man that helped us when we dropped them off.\n\nShe brought our jackets out in a plastic trash bag and I looked them over to see the repair. The jacket with the tear on the seam looked to be repaired well, yet the stitching used to fix the tear was black, while all other stitching on the jacket was tan. I brought this to her attention and she asked if I wanted to send it back to be redone. I told her no, as I wasn't very thrilled with the idea of another interaction at the shop. The jacket with the tear on the arm looks to have been glued, and the tear (now glued back together) looks to be bigger than it was when I dropped it off.\n\nFor $80.00 I would have expected more. Maybe this shop is better at shoe repair than leather repair. \n\nDisappointed overall.",0
"I am amazed!\nI wear heels...all the time. \nI fall in love with certain pairs and inevitability need to have the tips of my stilettos replaced. I had been putting it off, because I thought I would be without my favorite pairs for a few days. I called The Shoe Shop. They were so friendly and said if I can in before 2pm they could fix my shoes while I waited. What???\nI got there about 1:30 and (having a blonde moment) was wearing one of the pairs i needed fixed. The gal took the shoes I was wearing and the other pair to the back, where the magic happens. She came back seriously 2 minutes later with perfectly repaired heels. I could not believe it! The cost was $12.50 per pair, quite a deal when they are done this fast!\n\nI am a forever customer, it was a perfect experience!",1
How could someone walk in this place and not have a great experience. I value my expensive Italian shoes and when the leather starts to crack and they are in need of a pro job count on this place. I just reviewed a nightmare shoe shop about a month ago down the street. This place puts the other place to shame. This shoe shop is run by authentic Italians that work hard and deserve more than their underpriced work. Thank G-d I finally found a proper shoe repair and shine store that I can count on doing not only a fantastic job but not ripping me off.,1
"Worst. Buffet. Ever.\n\n'Nuff said. No...scratch that, I must vent. Or Yelp.\n\nWow, what a disaster. My workmate and I were craving a buffet today, and on the way into work I had passed the Golden Coin and thought it looked like any standard cheap buffet from the outside. But I was fooled, it's not just ANY cheap buffet, it's THE cheap buffet. \n\nWell, as Roger Daltrey says, \""""I won't get fooled again!\""""\n\nThe sign outside says $4.86 buffet, lunch or dinner. For less than a Lincoln, it's worth a try, right? (Wrong!) First of all, cash only, people, no plastic. And here's the ENTIRE buffet list:\n\nRice (of the brown fried variety, bland)\nLo Mein (I'm not sure what that taste is, but it ain't Lo Mein)\nEgg Rolls (small, cut in half, and awful. And there's that \""""taste\"""" again...)\nFried Chicken (the only food of redeeming quality)\nWings (again, bland, though decent in size)\nSweet and Sour Pork (I'll get to this in a second)\n\nYep, that's it. The whole buffet. And no refills on the sodas, either. Some greasy chinese crispy noodles. No soup. (Hey, no soup means not having to provide spoons!)\n\nThe fried chicken wasn't bad, but other than that, I wouldn't serve this food to prisoners. Except the ones on death row, and that's to save money on electricity.\n\nI'm not quite sure what the deal was with the Sweet and Sour Pork. The sauce was the consistency of water, the meat was......wait, I don't want to know. \n\nIf I could give it 1/1000th of a star, I'd do it. Steer clear, and your digestive system will thank you.",0
"Let's be fair to Mike Kwan here & make it clear that this is NOT the worst buffet in Phoenix, much less the world.  For that, you'd have to decide between Hong Kong Restaurant & New Sun Star Super Buffet at Central & Southern!\n\nThe problem here isn't that the food is bad, it's that they don't have anything!  It's a tiny place with just a few hot food choices for $4.86.  Now, I'm not going to complain about the price, but I want salad, so that was it for this place... won't see you there!\n\nIf you want \""""cheap\"""", whip over to Best Wok Buffet at McDowell & 51st Ave. instead.  It's much better, & it's only $4.25 for lunch, & $4.95 for dinner!",0
"Walked in the other day. Looked at the dashboard size buffet of 8 maybe 10 items. One of those being fried chicken, which is probably better done across the street. Walked back out and will never return. The place is a rat hole! The building should be condemned.",0
"= = = = = =  DAILY LUNCH BUFFET  = = = = = =\n\n\nOMG, say it isn't true!  I have to come back to this one already & give it an update?  It's only been 3 years 2 months & 29 days since I was here last time!  Let's wait!     :-O\n\nIt's true, I did have to force myself to come back to this Buffet, but I felt that I owed it to them to see if they've improved it from it's former One-Starness.  It's amazing that they're still in business here, actually!  Look at all of the Buffets that have closed down around them in the last three years, yet Mr. & Mrs. Kwan here soldier on!\n\nThe negatives:\n\n*  The bathroom has one of those circulating cloth towels to dry your hands with, so you have to use toilet paper to turn off the faucets & open the door, if you want to leave with fewer germs on your hands than you came in with...  maybe!\n\n*  The doors on both sides of the restaurant were propped open, so I had to fight over my food with flies!\n\n*  The food selection was by far the smallest of any Chinese Buffet in the Valley, with only 8 trays!  It's not about price either.  Best Wok is CHEAPER than this place & has 32 main food items!\n\nThe food:\n\nThe items were Spring Rolls, Fried Rice, Lo Mein, mixed vegetables in a bit of a juice, fried chicken legs & thighs, crispy rice (?) chips, Pepper Chicken in sauce, & Sweet & Sour Pork.  Everything was the right temperature & tasted ok.\n\nThe dining room:\n\nIt's very blah, but was adequately clean & comfortable except for the flies.  The acoustics & light coming in were all right & there were a moderate number of customers coming & going during my visit, for both dining in & take-out.\n\nSO, Mike Kwan's Golden Coin here has improved a little from three years ago, but you're still better off driving west just over to 24th St. & right a block to New China Buffet.  They have a much larger food selection, a little nicer dining room, & $6.85 there includes help-yourself beverages.     :-)\n\nGolden Coin Lunch & Dinner Buffet always $5.16, cash only.",0
"Very small selection of food.  a little over $7 total with tax and drink.\n\nOne long tray of fried chicken.... only one thing missing. KETCHUP. Why bother eating fried chicken if you can't have it with Ketchup?\nNo refill in drinks except ice tea. \n\nI gave two stars because the fried chicken actually tasted good.  If you like eating loads of fried chicken. go to this buffet. Just bring your own ketchup. lol\n\n I will never go to this buffet again, except if i have a massive craving for fried chicken.",0
"this place sucked u walk in cash only had to go to chevron and pull money out biggest mistake i should have stayed out so its $6.95 with a drink and you have to get ice tea to get refills all the good ones u have to pay (not that the others were any better) another $1.40 (retarded) the selection is 4 or 5 dishes which include chicken, fried rice, fried noodles, small freaken veggie egg rolls and some pepper chicken (WTF) seat selection is not bad but you see drunk indians go behind the gas station not to mention if you need the restroom its a door that goes outside to another door smh this is NOT place you wanna go sorry but i will never return",0
"I have been going to this place for the last 7 years or more. It is what you expect for cheap Chinese food. It is even referred to by my wife a \""""The Cheap Chinese Place\"""". The Sweet and Sour Pork is a staple. The egg rolls are awesome and the Ice Tea is cold.. most of the time. The \""""To Go\"""" Order is an amazing amount of food for the price. I highly recommend this place for a try. Don't go in expecting the best but it's better than most.",1
"Wish I was able to give  1/2 of a Star! \n\nI don't know why the Yelper in me failed to check  out Golden Coin prior to giving it a shot.  However, I craved an all you can eat Chinese Buffet and went to Golden Coin because it was close to work. Probably the worst Chinese buffet I have ever been to, I take that back  \""""No Probably\"""" about it, Golden Coin is the worst Chinese Buffet I have ever been to!   \n\n                                  Eight Items on the Buffet \n\nFried Wontons, Rice, Lo Mien, Vegetables, Chicken, Chicken Wings, Egg Rolls, & Sweet and Sour pork\n\n\nAs I took my first bite of rice a single thought ran through my head: \""""How can a Chinese Restaurant not cook rice right\""""?  If the rice wasn't bad enough the Lo Mien sure was, not sure how to describe that taste, but it's not Lo Mien, so I will stick with tasteless soggy noddles. The eggrolls were equally bad, small, cut in half, and horrible and once again a taste that is hard to describe, so lets go with tasteless again, after all it worked when describing the Lo Mien. Moving on to the sweet and sour pork, this dish consisted of  small,dried out,  hard pieces of what  I am assuming was pork covered in a reddish sauce that had the consistency of water.  Tasteless doesn't begin to describe that dish! The Wontons can best be described as greasy crispy noddles and don't even get me started on the chicken and wings. How in the world does Golden Coin prepare that stuff? It's awful. \n\nSo there yo have it, that's it. The entire Golden Coin Buffet. Don't think you can wash down a bad meal with soda....no refills on the sodas at Golden Coin!!!!",0
"The menu is small and the restaurant isn't the fanciest, but the food was decent and the price was extremely low. Good choice for a quick lunch/dinner.",1
"The food here is surprisingly better than i thought it would be, considering i rarely ever eat cheap food much less cheap all you can eat Chinese food. But do far the food is edible, i don't think I'm gonna get food poisoning, and it was after all cheap $7.40 for dinner with all your can eat and soda. \nI'm dropping stars because it seems impossible to get a refill on soda. So far it's been fifteen minutes and I thirsty as heck.  Is normally leave a tip, but I'm not happy with their service here",0
"Pushing the boundary of the Chinese buffet.\n\nGenerally I'll visit an establishment at least three times prior to writing a review.  A second or third visit to Mike Kwan's Gold Coin would be of surprise to me. CASH ONLY, with tax included $6.15 paid for my admission to this buffet-style meal.  Kid's under the age of four eat for $2.  It was surprisingly busy.\n\nThe \""""buffet\"""", in its entirety:\nWon-Ton Crisps\nFried Rice\nChow Mein\nMixed Vegetables\nFrench Fries\nEgg Roll Halves\nFried Chicken\nHot Wings\nSweet & Sour Pork\n\nHere in lay my greatest criticism; Yes, technically, there is more than one Chinese item among the food set out in large trays for an individual to return to as many times as they like.  In no other way does the Gold Coin overlap with common consumer expectation of a \""""Chinese Buffet.\""""  So, why was it so busy?  Because, for a tick north of five bucks a person could gluttonously stuff themselves with the above items; it is better thought of as an economical \""""family-style\"""" meal.  If it was advertised as such, I bet Mike's would get better reviews as people wouldn't feel mislead when they walked in, and the balance of Chinese, to American, to Italian, to Mexican to whatever cultural dishes would be freed up as well.  It has its redeeming qualities, which is why it didn't get the single start rating; it's clean, inexpensive, and seemed like a friendly casual atmosphere.",0
"The receptionist was not friendly, and wears no name tag so I didn't know who was greeting me.  She actually never said \""""hello\"""" and never smiled.\n\nLong wait times, so schedule when you have a lot of time and bring a good book.  \n\n\n\nThe doctor removed several freckles for no reason at all apparently, because she didn't explain why, leaving me with scars that I did not want.\n\nCan't say this was a good experience and I won't be back.\nLook for a doctor who thoroughly explains what she is doing and why.    I prefer a doctor who answers questions thoroughly, especially since the wait time was so long.   I expected better quality of service during my visit but was very disappointed.",0
"I have had numerous appointments here over the past 4 years to treat breakouts, and I am less than impressed with the PA's and tx methods. You never see a dermatologist...only a PA. They don't ask questions about your skin, their exam of your skin is bare minimum, and they prescribe topicals and send you out the door. No education about possible causes & possible preventatives (other than their topical meds). This past experience with PA Kenan was ridiculous. He wouldn't prescribe oral meds, stating my skin wasn't bad enough. Well, in my opinion it is bad, and topicals are not working, and how would he know anyway because I had make-up on and he barely looked at my face. He offered nothing in regards to treating the breakout problem other than prescribing topicals & referring me to their aestatician, which neither have worked for me! If you need acne help, go to a real derma, not a PA, and another clinic if you want treatment for acne.",0
"They were SO rude....Dr. Romine was nice enough to stop by and said \""""anything you need make sure you contact us\"""" but besides that they were just plain rude. Definitely not going back....",0
"Dr.Romine is wonderful. However if you ever have to interact with Riley the woman that does the laser skin procedures I highly suggest going elsewhere. She was rude, abrasive, and poor communicator from day 1. I came in for a spot on my face that had been there since last year. She set up a series of procedures and did not realize until the 3rd one (2 wks apart each, costing $100) that was not the treatment I needed. She never seemed to recall our initial consult and concerns and was so wrapped up in \""""knowing it all\"""" and attitude she never took the time to listen to the patient and what the presenting complaint truly was. The incorrect treatment was for depression or differences in the skin texture of a scar and did nothing for the actual problem, her excuse being I termed it \""""a scar\"""" so that's just what you get. They are the professionals and they should know what treatment to recommend and that the brown pigment was the initial complaint which I said several times since I walked in the door. To top off the attitude every time we spoke- she canceled an appointment the day before which I had planned for over a month and was the only day until November I could do it because of the down time after. When I walked in for the appt and asked why the law was in place (doctor suddemly not in the office building that day so she couldn't do it) she just stated I don't break the law for a procedure instead of explaining the reason behind it.  Extremely poor commuunication and listening skills- highly suggest going elsewhere!!",0
"I asked a friend of mine if she had a good dermatologist, and she goes to Camelback Derm.  I made an appointment (dealing with mild acne), and was optimistic for some new treatment as well as to get a prescription for a topical I had already been using.  I knew going into it I would be seeing a PA first and then meet the doctor.  I made it clear on both the written forms they have you fill out as a new patient and verbally stated to the PA that I have an autoimmune disorder and cannot take certain medications with antibiotics.  I met the doctor for only 5 minutes.  i was still given a prescription for a topical with an antibiotic in it and when i got home, after doing more research, it was highly suggested on many websites (including the drug company's) to not use this medication because of my autoimmune disorder.  This was the first frustrating issue.  I called the doctors office and left a message with the nurse's line, and they did call back pretty quickly saying they would change the prescription.  While it was nice that the doctor gave me samples and coupons for the prescriptions, one of them was expired, and could not use it at the pharmacy (though I did end up later finding one online through the drug company).  I also found that frustrating-but only because it costed me an extra half an hour of going back and forth to the pharmacy.  Overall, I felt most bothered by the fact that I expressed more than once that I have this pre-existing condition that should be taken into consideration, and the neither the PA nor the doctors seemed to take notice.  I do understand that this doctors office is very large and busy, but being that I was a new patient to the office, I felt very rushed.  But, this office location is very convenient to where I live, and for the most part do not have many other skin problems to deal with, so I don't plan on having to go to this office very often, other than to follow up on my progress with these medications.",0
"This office is very incompetent. I asked for an annual check up but the PA Molly who is very rude, said she was not told I wanted that and spent THREE MINUTES total with me, and left without ever asking me if I had any questions. She was concerned with staying on schedule (she was already late) rather than treating me. The room I waited in was FILTHY--dirty dressing gowns overflowing the wastebasket and on the floor.",0
"Beautiful new offices at 40th street and Campbell, but apparently their clocks don't work. Just sat there for 60 minutes past my 8:45 am appointment time, and no one saw me. Had to leave for a meeting. If I was in customer service there, I would remind the doctors that their customers' time is more valuable than their own.",0
"I saw Dr. Romine's office for a few years for acne maintenance. Eventually I decided to see one of her aestheticians for a light chemical peel.  This light peel ended up scabbing over most of my face mainly on the sides near my cheeks. I went back to  them after it started to get more severe and was told by Dr. Romine that I was actually lucky because I was getting the result of a more aggressive, more expensive peel. What I wasn't given was the proper instruction and/or topical treatment for this type of peel which has subsequently left me with the darkening and scarring of my face. I went back 6 or so months later with these same concerns and was told that I have a skin condition and that it was not caused by the peel. However, I know that it was.  Seeing as this is a dermatology office, I felt confident getting this type of procedure.  I understand that sometimes things don't go as planned, but not taking accountability for these things is a different story.  Maybe I could have taken some sort of legal action, which I did not,  but would like others to be aware before deciding to get a treatment like this from them.",0
"Found Dr Romina on Phoenix mag listed best dermatologist. I tried botox and filler which made no difference at all. Wasted almost 1500$. Dr said she made me look natural! I am only not that I need a lot of filler/botox. Also had facial peeling, aesthetician spilled the chemical on my lip which caused dark spot!",0
"I am beyond happy and just tickled with the amazing results from Dr. Romina.  I have a horrible furrow on my brow and this angel of a doctor placed Dysport.  It is day 2 and the deep furrow is ironed out, my face natural and softly lifted.  I was so worried because I did have a bad prior experience with another office and I had no experience with Dysport previously.  She corrected the remains of the bad work and took care of my main problem.  I did pay a bit more than what I had in mind, but I am so pleased with the result it is well worth it to have someone experienced do the work properly. \n\nIt would be a five star, but it is true what the other reviewers said about the scheduling, as  I did take time off from work to arrive for my appointment and waited over one hour for the doctor to show. This could improve.  But it also could be looked at a good thing if the doctor is taking the proper time with patients, I don't mind waiting for great results.  Looking forward to getting more work at this location.",1
"beautiful new office but I had never been to their old one, overall was satisfied with the staff but only got to see the Nurse practitioner but not the Dermatologist on my first Visit, I do have follow up visit which I hope I will eventually get to see the Doctor Romina as well. staff were very professional and I was satisfied with my diagnosis and treatment",1
"Wish I could review this place on service but I wasn't able to get one.  Walked in at 1 PM on a Sunday afternoon for a mani pedi, was told by the front nail tech to have a seat.  I get it, I walked in on a Sunday afternoon so they are going to be busy and I am fine to wait.  My wait turned into 30 minutes and no one said a word to me.  Then the front nail guy tells me it is going to be another 20 minutes before someone would be able to get to me.  You know your salon, you know your techs and how long it will take them to do a service as well as how many people are in front of me so it would have been nice to have gotten a expected wait time before I wasted an hour my time.  I ended up leaving and going to another salon who saw me right away  \n\nThe place in general was dirty, nail polish spilled down the wall and dust everywhere.  I did not get to see how clean their pedi baths and chairs were but the front waiting and front desk area was filthy.",0
"I don't like writing negative reviews but honestly after my visit to Andys I have no idea what the 4 & 5 star ratings are all about...\n\nFirst the good ~ my pedicure was good.  The lady actually listened to what I told her I wanted unlike the 2 nail techs that worked on me later.  The massage was nice and the color and design came out great.  The only downside to the pedicure was the \""""upselling\"""" of services but most places do that so I don't consider that much of a negative.\n\nMy acrylics tho was a totally different story.  I told the tech I wanted french tips ~ what I ended up with were tips that were painted white which began chipping off in a matter of days.  Part of it was my fault as I was talking to my friend and not paying attention to what was being done.  Once I did notice I just didn't have the time for them to start over.   Even with an appointment I had to wait 30 minutes after before anyone could work on me.  The 2 techs that worked on my nails started having a rapid fire conversation in Vietnamese and took their time getting back to my nails.\n\nThe nails were way to thick ~ my term for the end result was hooker nails... ughhh!   Even tho the pedicure came out well at a good price I will not go back again.  I found a salon much closer with a very skilled nail tech who I will be going to from now on.  It costs more but then again you get what you pay for.",0
"I hate giving a bad review.  But I am PISSED and feel that I must due to the situation I'm going through presently.  I've been going to Andy's for off and on now for about 2 years (When I need a pedi last moment) and have not had any problems.  Then again, I really don't recall getting nicked or having a tech go overkill with the nippers.  \n\nFlash back to last Thursday.  I want to get a quick pedi before J and I headed to Vegas for the Labor Day weekend.  So, I head over to Andy's.  Everything is going well, until the tech starts trimming the cuticles and going after what she must think is a hangnail or something.  Next thing I know, a piece of skin is being what felt like ripped from the side of my toenail bed.  I'm not bleeding, so I think nothing of it.  \n\nThe rest of Thursday - toe is feeling so-so.  \nFriday - toe starts feeling a little sore.  \nSaturday - more soreness.  \nSunday, my toe is starting to full on hurt.  Got some redness going on.  Me not having any issues like this in the past, I don't think too much of it.  All week long, my flippin toe continues to hurt.  Even when I'm not walking.  So I decide that I need to do something.\n\nThis morning, I mention it to a coworker of mine who's dealt with nail fungus before from getting shoddy services at other establishments.  With my leg hiked up on my desk we take a closer look.  She then says to me, \""""That looks a little green.\""""  \nME - WHAT THE F_CK!??!  \nSure enough, right along the cuticle there's a small green patch.  She says that she's seen nailbeds turn green, but not the skin.  I'm pissed.  \n\nI was tempted to return to Andy's to ask them, \""""WTF is this sh*t\"""". But knowing that I had a regular nail appointment (for my gel nails, that i get at a regular salon up in N. Scottsdale), I decide to ask my nail gal about it.  \n\nSo I head on up to my appointment after work.  No sooner than I get back to my gel gals station, I tell her what's going on and ask her to have a look.  She gets down on her knees, looks at my toe, and immediately grabs some tool from her sanitizer container (the blue stuff).  A few presses of the tool and the next thing I know, puss is coming out from the side of my toe.  OMFingG.\n\nYUCK!!  GAG!!  My gal was super upset.  Upset at the fact that there are techs out there that are lazy and do not properly sanitize their tools and equipment.  \nWhich makes a bad name for everyone else who does do things by the book and follows State Board guidelines.  So now, I have to go and get my toe puss drained every day for the next week or so.  Toe Puss = FAIL\n\nIf I was a diabetic, I'd probably be having my toe amputated right about now.  Will I return to Andy's?  HELL TO THE F_CK NO!  \n\nAnd while its on my mind, let me make a call to the state board.\n\n(after thoughts) \nWhen I think about it, a lot of these chop shops do not properly disinfect their pedi bowls.  They're supposed to clean and disinfect the bowl and let circulate for 10 minutes.  I've seen this place, and other chop shops rinse with water, then wipe down with a kitchen type scrub sponge (sometimes spraying with a 409 type product), and then refill with water for the next customer.  \n\nFrom the EPA website on Disinfection for Foot Spa Basins - \nhttp://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/footspa_disinfection.htm\nAfter Each Client: (this can take place any time after the client's feet are out of the footbath, while feet are massaged, toes are painted, or other opportunities)\n\n1.Drain the water from the foot spa basin or bowl and remove any visible debris. \n2.Clean the surfaces of the foot spa with soap or detergent, rinse with clean water, and drain. \n3.After cleaning, disinfect* the surfaces with an EPA-registered hospital disinfectant (for description) according to the manufacturer's directions on the label. Surfaces must remain wet with the disinfectant for 10 minutes or the time stated on the label, which may be shorter. \n* For whirlpool foot spas, air-jet basins, \""""pipe-less\"""" foot spas, and other circulating spas: It is best to disinfect by filling the basin with clean water, adding the appropriate amount of liquid disinfectant, and turning the unit on to circulate the disinfectant for the entire contact time. \n4.After disinfection, drain and rinse with clean water. \n\nNext time you get your mani-pedi (at any nail place), start to take notice of how they're disinfecting/cleaning.",0
"I was referred to Andy's by somebody, but after reading some of the reviews I was a little bit hesitant to go in. Honestly, I am very happy I did. Despite what some reviews say, I thought the salon was very clean, and I saw the equipment being sanitized. I made a 5pm appointment, but i got there early and was seen immediately. I got a gel manicure,  Kim did the manicure, and Anne the polish. They were both extremely nice. My manicure came out perfect, and it was only $25. I will definitely be going back.",1
"Can in on a whim and asked the cost of gel on the toe nails (I'm at the pool a lot). They said $15 more than the place I usually go to. I was in a rush and really needed to get both a fill and a pedicure, they refused the service despite my agreement to the ridiculous price.",0
It's official Andys nail has went down the drain. I have been coming here for 6 years and can say will never be back. There work has got so poor! I stopped getting my nails done there 2 years but loved the girls that did the pedis. All those girl are now gone and the people now just suck. Especially this dude they hired. Over priced for the less then mediocre work. Very unhappy walked out with toe nails crocked and only half painted nails( they didn't paint the whole nails),0

"I've always considered myself a bit of a dive bar aficionado.  I love the complete and total lack of pretension that comes with them.  They exist for one reason and one reason only.  To get you fucked up.  That's why I was so pleased to find this little gem just stumbling distance from my house.  Emphasis on the word \""""find\"""" because you would never notice this place if you weren't specifically looking for it.  It's a tiny little hole in the wall sandwiched between a scuba school and some little collectible shop that doesn't look like it's been opened since Nixon was in office.  You have to park around the back.  When you walk in there's a bar a few tables, a pool table, a jukebox and that's it.  They don't a have a shit ton of TV's broadcasting every sporting event this side of hell. They don't serve food. They serve drinks and that is it.  As it should be!  They pour em strong and they pour em cheap.  It's not a place you go to to pick up chicks.  They cater to professional drunks who have no illusions about why they're there.  That's what a good dive bar should do and they do it well.  I look forward to many a night spent in it's dingy throes.  They take cards but there is a $10 minimum.  Hope to see you there!",1
"\""""Great Escape Lounge the\""""? Seriously? Whoever addresses my junk mail must be posting business listings to Yelp now. \n\nQuestionable grammar aside, this place in a word, rocks. I want to lick the crusty underbody of its cracked, upholstered stools and have its dive bar babies. I'll wean those tough as nails tykes on a whiskey nipple and have them hustling gullible pool players by the age of six. Yeah, that's right. You just got beat by a baby that sound like a chain smoking grannie, bitch.\n\nPicture that visual. It isn't pretty. Neither is The Great Escape. \n\nHell you've probably driven by it half a dozen times and never even noticed it. Maybe your cocktail radar needs some fine tuning. I know all it takes is the illusion that booze can be had for me to veer left into a parking lot and saunter up to the bar, primal \""""beer good\"""" sense a-tingling. \n\nI realize I haven't told you jack about the place yet, but the faded stucco, dated sign and busted up jalopy in the parking lot should tell you all you need to know. This kind of ambiance can only be achieved through years of hard living in the fast lane and a general air of neglect. Play pool. Fire up the jukebox. Make an ass of yourself and do the chicken dance. Whatever gets your freaky rocks off. Just don't spill my drink.\n\nBring cash. Or be prepared to pound three drinks to meet their ten dollar requirement for opening a tab. Ten dollars for two beers and shot. What the eff are you still doing reading this!? It's Friday afternoon. Get off your ass and go check out a little dive square at the corner of Awesome Avenue and Rock Your Face Off Boulevard.\n\nYeah I might be a little drunk writing this review but do you want the triple distilled Erica, or do you want the burning raw power that only some backwoods firewater to the bloodstream can provide? I think we all know the answer to that one. All you have to do is be brave enough to turn to the bartender and say, slap me fast and rotten with the hoppiest stank you got. And make it a double. \n\nUgh, get some.",1
"I am new to the area and I wanted a dive bar night. I hit Yelp up to help me find a few places, this was one of them. \nI had chose 3 from yelp to go to in one night and this was my second stop. It is not as divey as the previous reviews in my opinion. It is clean, well lit, and the furniture is in good condition. These qualities are opposite of a dive bar. It seemed to me that the customers were all regulars. there is one pool table in the center of the bar and a jukebox. Someone thought we would all enjoy three 311 songs in a row. Not so much. \n\nThe beer specials are great. i don't think I will be returning, the stares from the regular customers made me uncomfortable and the only thing dive bar about it is the stinky bathroom.",0
"My only direct experience with these guys was when I ordered flowers for my wife's anniversary present.  My initial conversation with the owner was very promising, in which he said that he could gladly make it a small and simply elegant bouquet, featuring purple to match our wedding flower colors, and involving a lot of reassuring yeses (picturing head-nodding as well).  But instead, after charging about $60, they delivered a generic looking arrangement of white flowers that I probably could have found at Safeway for $15.  I love supporting local businesses -- only if they are reliable enough to deliver on promises.  Not sure about going back here again.",0
"Based on reading reviews from Yelp, I picked this florist to send flowers to someone in the local area who has been dealing with an illness.  On a positive note: the recipient said the flowers were gorgeous and had never seen such a beautiful arrangement and variety of flowers.  On a negative note: I did not feel that the store had very good customer service.  The first time I called to place my order, the person who answered the phone basically told me she was too busy to talk to me because she was the only person there.  So I ordered online off their web site.  The next day, upon calling the store, I found out my flowers were sent out without any confirmation phone call or email detailing what exactly was being sent and the final fee with the delivery fee (for being outside the delivery zip code).  I was unhappy with this aspect and told the store owner such, and he refunded my delivery fee.  You can't just run through a charge on someone's credit card without giving them a final amount.  Overall, glad the flowers were superb but this store could benefit from improved customer communication/service.",1
"I have used Fresh Cut Romance in the past and haven't ever had a problem with them...until last week.  I was out of town and tried ordering a bouquet for a friend who is losing her mother.  I ordered very early in the morning on Thursday and then received a message much later in the day saying there would be a $40 delivery charge to deliver to Gilbert.  I wasn't excited about the charge but at that point just wanted to have them delivered that day and didn't have time to order something else that would be delivered in time so I said okay only to then be told oh never mind, we can't deliver to that zip code.  I was asking them to be delivered to Gilbert...not central phoenix albeit but still not super far away.  If they don't deliver to this zip code there should probably be a list of zip codes they do deliver to or perhaps their staff should be aware of this when they call saying there would be a $40 charge to deliver.  Then, I find out the next day that they also called the girl I was trying to send the flowers to because they wanted to let her know I had ordered her flowers but that they were not going to deliver them because it was too far.  In my opinion, most of the fun of getting flowers is the surprise.  This was a very poor business decision and completely deflated my intention of doing something to put a smile on my friends face.  I will not use Fresh Cut Romance in the future.",0
"I love this place! The staff are courteous and knowledgable. I am typical man that has no sense of taste on flowers, what to send per occasion, etc... Pam was there when I needed her.

"Though, I never had a friend with a grandma in Alaska, if I did, I am sure her trailer (if she lived in a trailer) would look alot like this bar. Everything tinged with a hue of grey from the years of cancer sticks being offered up with well drinks by her trucker friends and their kids. Collections of debris/life scattered around and odd papers pinned to walls - oh and weird fish tanks that are so clean they make their surroundings look even more crusty.  The staff is cool though - even if they don't really work there but have \""""filled in\"""" for 20 years....they make it worth a drink.",0
"In short, the Dilly is a drinker's bar.  Cheap drinks, tons of regulars, and dark enough to make it easy to forget the world outside.  Hipsters beware, this isn't the Little Woody, it isn't the Vig...hell, it's not even Hazelwood's, but it is a great place to unwind.\n\n- pool table, check\n- darts, check\n- TVs, check\n- jukebox, check\n- strange edibles served out of a liquid-filled jar, check\n- seasoned, female bartender that doesn't take shit from anyone, check\n- fellow customer offering to give you a tattoo right there, for free, check",1

"Dr. Bracken is very talented.  His staff is incredible.  He treats my pets with incredible love and attention (acts like their his very own buddies).  He is not only kind, but extremely knowledgeable.  He is willing to take the extra effort and time to ensure proper diagnosis and reviews all of the potential treatments.  He understands how important the smaller members of your family are.  \n\nHe came highly recommended by several friends of mine and I'll never go anywhere else.  Everyone that knows him gives him rave reviews.  He charges appropriately (its not the cheapest place to go, I'm sure, but the quality and value of care is far above anywhere else.)\n\nHe even notices your pets personality, which must be hard after seeing so many pets a day.  He goes the extra mile, ensuring your pet is fully cared for.\n\nIts a large facility with lots of employees, but there's only one Dr. Braken.  He answers each question himself.",1
"I have had dogs my whole life and have been to many different Vets around Scottsdale and Phoenix. I got a new puppy in July and a friend recommended Dr. Bracken so highly that I decided to go instead of taking her to my regular vet. I signed her up on the puppy plan which is great when you have a new puppy. It includes all shots, nail trimmings, visits and a discount on spaying. Dr. Bracken is the sweetest, most caring vet I have ever been to, he takes time to teach you puppy training and answers any and all questions you may have.  I have since taken my two other dogs and transferred their medical records to his office. You can tell on your first visit that Dr. Bracken's office is very busy but he is worth the wait. He loves dogs just as much as you do and isn't driven by the all mighty dollar that so many other vets exude. I would trust his honest, straight forward opinion over any one else!!!!!! I normally don't write that many reviews but if you love your dogs as much as I do, you'd taken them here!",1
"Dr. Bracken is the best vet I have ever encountered.  My dog hurt his back and they took fantastic care of him and found a great neurosurgeon for us to have his back fixed.  All his general checkups and teeth cleaning have been great. The staff there just really seem to love animals and it shows. They even call back to check in to make sure everything is going okay with him. It's a ways to Arcadia from my house ( I live in south Tempe ), but I wouldn't even consider taking my dog to anyone else.  If you are looking for a vet you can't do better than Dr. Bracken.",1
"Those who have cats and love them as much as I do, know that it can be difficult to find a veterinarian who is good with them. The reviews written by Teri B. and Sarah K. helped me to make up my mind and give this clinic a try since I was looking for the vet who was on the holistic side and really good with cats. And so far I haven't been disappointed. Dr. Bracken is very knowledgeable and progressive, and just like other reviews say - very kind, attentive to your pet, generous with his time and doesn't try to run the bill or prescribe/do any unnecessary procedures. The day before we went there I read somewhere online that a good veterinarian, before going straight to the exam, will try to interact with your pet, and that's exactly what Dr. Bracken did, even before he introduced himself to us! I have a Bengal and Dr. Bracken already knew what to expect of him, it was obvious he was familiar with the breed. But what is more important, my cat, who usually goes crazy at the vet's office, headbutted him marking him as his friend. He also asked me to tell him about my cat which had never happened before at other veterinarians' offices. \nWhen I told him my cat was on a BARF diet (Biologically Appropriate Raw Food) he didn't roll his eyes and didn't try to convince me that it was dangerous or inappropriate as I've read most veterinarians do. Actually, after talking a little more to him about it, I found out that he had done some reading on this topic and sees positive results. He even accepted \""""An open letter to veterinary professionals\"""" that I had printed out for him, which appeals to veterinarians to stop endorsing dry kibble and supporting pet food companies that have only one goal - profit and not our pets' health, and instead to learn more about ALL diets so they could help us to make better choices for our pets when it comes to their nutrition. He didn't try to push any vaccines (we were there for an annual exam) either.  To sum it up, the exam was not as stressful for my cat (which means for me as well) as usual, my cat likes his new doctor and I trust him. The only negative - you may have to schedule the appointment way ahead of time, especially if the only day you can go is Saturday. We had to wait about 2 or 3 weeks, but I say it's worth it.",1
"Dr Bracken is the best! He has a wonderful bedside manner, and he knows his stuff! \n\nHe loves big dogs (we have Newfoundlands) and knows problems specific to them. For example, when we were in a different state, our newf got sick, and we still didn't have an answer after $3000 work up. When we saw Dr Bracken (after we moved), he gave us the answer right away, without running a single test. And he was right all along. \n\nHe is super caring, and even if he doesn't see you back for a follow up, he always wants you to call and let him know how your baby is doing. \n\nThe only drawback is that I have referred so many people to him (as I'm sure others have), that his schedule is always booked, and unless you are an established patient, it may be hard to get an appt.",1
"Dr. Braken is the best vet, hands down!  He is the gold standard of vets and takes excellent care and thoroughness in his work!  I will not trust anyone else with my dog and wish I could give him a 100 stars, he's that great!",1
"I often say I wish I could find a doctor with the bedside manner of my dog's veterinarian.Dr. Bracken is amazing. \n\nMy parents have been taking our dogs their since I was little. I am now an adult and have been taking my pups there for 11 years. Dr. Bracken gets on the ground and talks to my dogs. He never suggests unnecessary procedures. I think his rates are very fair.  \n\nMy senior dog has had valley fever, a severe illness as the result of an icky pig ear, and a thyroid condition. Dr. Bracken has given her the best care possible and I know that's why she is 11 years old and still acts like a puppy. \n\nHis staff has been able to see my dogs with little notice when they've been ill, and can often suggest at-home treatment for run of the mill illnesses over the phone. \n\nHe is so patient with pet parents and gives thorough explanations. i cannot say enough wonderful things about him and his staff.",1
1-1/2 stars for the doctor's reputation. He's supposed to be exceptional.  1/2 star for the person I talked to being friendly but unconcerned. When calling I got a busy signal each time I tried for over 5 minutes.  When the phone was answered I was put on hold for at least another 5 minutes.  When I got a person I said I wanted to make an appointment for my dog. I wasn't asked what was wrong with my pet I was just asked if my dog was a current patient.  I said no and was then told it would be at least 3 weeks before they'd be able to see us.  To me busy signals and long holds don't bode well and then 3 weeks to get an appointment with them not even knowing my dog's condition?  The practice must be TOO busy and they need additional help.  Going elsewhere.,0
"My family and I have been going to Arcadia Animal Clinic for years! Even when we lived in North Phoenix, we have always believed the hour drive to see Dr. Bracken was well worth it. He is honest, caring, and does an amazing job at taking his time to explain what is going on with your dog in layman's terms. I, as well as everyone I know who sees Dr. Bracken, can testify that he GENUINELY cares about every animal that walks through the door!  \nOur dog has had some very random medical problems throughout his life. Dr. Bracken has always taken time and care to make a medial treatment plan that is FAIR! I am writing this review because in addition to already loving our care at Arcadia Animal Clinic, Dr. Bracken and the family at the clinic helped us in a way that they will never know. My fianc\u00e9 and I were 3 weeks away from our Sedona wedding when our lab suddenly stopped peeing and refused food. Dr. Bracken stayed late in the office to talk us through the process of decisions we had to make at the emergency animal clinic. After $1,800 (ouch!) and no real diagnosis, AAC's office called us to see how he was doing after the hospital visit. The decision was made to bring him in for a few days to keep under AAC's care and observation. \nWe were extremely nervous; first, for the uncertainty of the situation, and second, because Coltrane was going to be our ring bearer in the wedding and we didn't know if he was going to be healthy enough to come on the trip up North. We were also stinging from the hospital bill - the thought of him going in for more treatment with our wedding pending 2 weeks away was devastating. \nDr. Bracken kept him longer than the anticipated 2 nights. Their staff was extremely kind and patient with us (I don't know how they deal so well with all of us crazed animal parents!) and after 7 days of overnight care with a catheter, 3 prescriptions, and a scheduled surgery, they called us and told us Cole could come home. When my fianc\u00e9 went to pay our bill, Dr. Bracken told us to enjoy our wedding and it was a gift from the Arcadia Animal Clinic. \nThere are no words that can explain how special that moment was for us. In the midst of the most stressful and financially trying couple weeks of our lives, they showed us love. I will never be able to say enough about this act of kindness; it left us literally stunned. \nWe will work our way to repay the staff of Arcadia Animal Clinic and will forever be thankful for that favor which meant the entire world to us. Thank you Dr. Bracken and your team for showing us that good people still exist in this world, and thank you for the extra special care of our most loved family member - Coltrane!!",1
"Not the Dunkin Donuts that everyone remembers.\n\nTwo tiny shelves of stale donuts...I guess when the grocer is selling your way overpriced coffee like gangbusters, you can forget what got you there in the first place.",0
Having a tough time this morning Dunkin?\n\nI ordered a Large mocha and an glazed donut.\n\nI received a medium coffee with cream and sugar.\n\nIt was at 11:00pm and I was the only car in the line.\n\nI don't feel the need to say anything else...\n\n:),0
Not the best run Dunkin' Donuts.,0
"After hearing all the hype, the commercials on tv, etc.... I finally got to experience Dunkin Donuts first hand.  I tried their donuts, coffee and breakfast sandwich. HMMM... Let's just say, I am not too disappointed that i don't have access to one locally. Their donuts were dry, my local donuts shop have way better donuts.",0
I like dunkin'  but the service sucks ..  The cashier was rude but I would be too if I had that job. \n\n\n\n\nShe messed up on our order didn't go back to change it because it would've been a waste of time she probably would've messed up on that as well. \n\nJust left dunkin' 20min ago!,0
at this Dunkin Donuts they definitely take care of the drive thru before the walk ups. Everytime I come in here there are at least 3 or 4 cars that were in the drive thru as I walk in that are driving out f the drive thru before I even get served. I'm a honestly never come back to this location. It happens every single time I come here and it just happened again today right now. It's really aggravating when you have two clerks who are working their asses off to get the drive thru taken care of While totally blowing off the walk up people.,0
"Great place for chicken. I come here about 3 times a month, Love the corn and black bean sides",1
"Del Taco? Get the fuck outta here.\nTaco Bell? No way in hell.\n\nHands down the best fast food Mexican restaurant on the face of the planet.\n\nThe stuffed quesadillas are out of this world delicious.\n\nThe Chicken Tacos al Carbon: quite the tasty street taco.\n\nI can only assume the other stuff they sell is excellent too. Red salsa is ok, but the green salsa is where its at.\n\nHappy feasting.",1
"My overall take away was that it was a long wait (over 10 minutes and there were no other drive through or dinning room customers), the food was eh, and it was pricey. I don't think I'll be going back.",0
"Recently moved to Phoenix, and this place is in my neighborhood.  El Pollo Loco is overpriced food with very small proportions.  I spent like $10 on some quesadilla's and they came with a small packet of tortillas and mushy salsa.  I'm a skinny guy, but was still hungry after eating this. The staff at this location seemed uninterested in their jobs both times I tried out them out.  Not worth it.",0
"Our chicken was so over cooked we could not eat most of it.  Our enchiladas were stone cold.  The  place was filthy,  greasy!  I was shocked , my Dad would not eat any of it.  I will never go back.",0
"Tried this place for the first time because of a commercial I saw about their new stuffed quesadilla and it was awesome! Had the enchilada one, very tasty. The chicken was spectacular, the tortilla was fresh, the cheese was generous and they had some kind of cabbage in it that really brought all the flavors together very nicely! Only problem was the lobby was smokey. I understand that it was because they were in the process of making their awesome fresh grilled chicken, but it made my eyes watery and cough a little. But overall! It was very good!",1
"At this El Pollo Loco they charge more for some items than any other El Pollo Loco I have been to. What happened to me is I simply asked for black beans instead of the pinto beans in a burrito and was told they might charge more. The manager came out and rudely said it would be .49 more. This is even after I mentioned that the 3 other El Pollo Loco's I go to do not charge more. I wasn't asking for a side dish, just a simple substitute. Wow, customer service is bad and I should have gone to any one of the other places around there.",0
"Great neighborhood sports bar!! Price is right, lots of drink specials. If you like playing pool or darts this place is for you.",1
"I was headed to TeePee, but at the last moment had a change of heart. I decided to go for a new Italian place, and this small restaurant caught my eye. Very small dining room, with nice tables positioned so you can sit close to your date. I had the prosciutto and melon, which came served as a single slice of Cantaloupe sitting on a bed of prosciutto. It was OK, but I was not a fan of the presentation. For my entree I had the Veal Parm, and it was sub-par. It felt like a chicken fried steak. The wine selection was nice, but not anything noteworthy. I noticed three servers, only one of which actually fielding questions, the other two in charge of bread and busing only. I would have preferred a darker, more intimate atmosphere, but it was not bad. The bill for two came to approx $80. I don't think I'll be back, there are too many spots to check out before this place deserves a second visit. Nice if this is your neighborhood Italian spot for a mid-week meal.",0
"Extremely disappointed in this place... I brought my sister and a friend who were both in town from New York. Our waiter was full of inappropriate comments, starting with calling our male friend \""""Hugh\"""" and asking if he was looking for a third girl now that Kendra had left. He later told my sister she looked like Caroline Kennedy, which is NOT a compliment. (Smart woman, very nice, but definitely not a looker. Kennedy, not my sister.) I appreciate friendly, cheerful service, but not ill-thought conversation.\n\nWe started our meals with salads. The house dressing has a distinctive fishy taste, despite being told there were no anchovies in it. There were wilted pieces of lettuce on my plate, and the walnuts were not chopped making it difficult to pick up with a fork at the same time as any of the wilted lettuce.\n\nMy entree was equally as disappointing. I ordered the lasagna, generally a safe choice on a maiden voyage at an Italian restaurant. Unfortunately, this time that was not the case. There were at least a dozen layers of lasagna noodles, making the dish very pasty. Between the layers there was barely any sauce, no discernable meat and zero cheese. I ate barely a quarter of it, yet now, three hours later, I still feel like there is a brick sitting in my stomach.\n\nMy sister ordered the veal parm, despite my story of being stared at by an adorable baby cow on the back of a dairy truck for ten miles in traffic one day. She soon regretted her choice as much as I regretted my lasagna. Mushy and bland, she also barely ate half her dish - and only a forkful of the greasy side dish of pasta served with it.\n\nOur friend ordered a shrimp and pasta dish, which he found adequate. He was please that the shrimp were as large as they were and that there were a lot of them, but he still didn't feel the dish wowed him enough to pay $25 for it.\n\nI finished with a dessert of a ricotta-based cheesecake with lemon curd topping. This too was adequate, as long as the filling and topping was eaten after being scraped off the mushy, bitter bottom layer (one could barely call it a crust).\n\nWe finished our meal at 8 PM on a Sunday night, and we were the only patrons in the establishment. That in itself told us a lot.\n\nI know this place has been open since the '80s, but I'm not sure how. We won't be returning again.",0
"Recommended by \""""Steve the Realtor, from Scottsdale\"""", La Fontanella was a pleasant dining experience on our first night in Phoenix. My Veal Toronados with Porchini Mushroom Sauce over a bed of fresh spinach was tender and flavorful -- quite devine. My husband thoroughly enoyed his Veal Ossobucco with baked polenta, claiming it one of the best he has eaten. Our Server, Roy, was friendly and provided excellent service. \n\nOur only complaint was the Busser seemed to be a bit off his game -- maybe a bad day? It may have spoiled the perfect dining experience, but not enough to keep us from going back next time we are in town. Thanks, Steve the Realtor from Scottsdale.",1
"Friends of ours invited us to meet them at this restaurant to celebrate a birthday.  Never having been there, I checked out their website, and found that it is one of a (small) chain of restaurants based in Chicago.  The menu looked interesting, and I tentatively chose an entree (Clams and Mussels alla Uncle Roy).  Upon arriving at the restaurant, I discovered that that dish was not on the menu.  I had chosen it because it was not tomato sauce or cream based.  The actual menu only has such main dishes.  In any case, I asked the waiter about the appetizer of  \""""creamy mariniere\"""" musselson the menu.  He didn't know, or couldn't explain, what \""""mariniere\"""" meant.  I guessed it was the standard dish, but boy was I wrong.  The mussels, very overcooked and chewy, came with a heavy tasteless cream sauce.  My main dish, the \""""pescatore\"""" came with exactly the same cream sauce.  And the mussels were likewise overcooked, but the clams were cooked so much that they were simply paste.  Inedible.  The wine we chose, Penfold's Bin #2 Syrah-Mourv\u00e8dre (a $10 bottle in the supermarkets), was priced at $30, an exhorbitant markup.  Nothing to recommend this restaurant -- oh, and did I mention the gruff and unhelpful waiter?",0
"La Fontanella is NOT your average Italian Restaurant the food is better. Much of the menu is Tuscan or Sicilian with many house made pastas, Dishes and are seasoned surprising well with many being braised or roasted and service is very professional in a crisp very clean dining rooms that look almost like someones home.\nThe foods we tried so far have been resort quality at nearly strip mall prices.\n\nWe were impressed with our last visit here so we made our second visit.\n\nWe started with the upgraded fresh salad's are upgraded when you add Gorgonzola and walnuts ($2) they were extremely crisp and piled high on the plate so high that salad spilled off the plate as you ate it. The bread they give you is good and you are given their signature herb ed olive oil.\n\nI had the special Chilean Sea Bass with spaghetti and both were cooked to perfection. The Fish was so perfect and light and the spaghetti was also a perfect al dente. This dish was set in a VERY WELL thought out stock that was perfect ,not salty, not oily, not buttery but laced with perfect flavors. Fresh chopped tomatoes and onion topped this dish.\n\nMy husband had the Ossobuco (Veal Shank) that was served with a fresh rice blend. \n\nWe were too full to have the really great house made gelato but had it last time. Desserts are all house made.\n\nThey put out a coupon about every other week for an approx $45.00 dinner for two special that includes a bottle of wine (that is a cash only special) You should clip out the coupon from the Thursday AZ Republic even if you want other dishes they are somewhat flexible with the coupon and you can save a large amount of money.\n\nI have told people I know about this place after our first visit and it is a favorite dining destination of theirs and they go back again and again also with friends.\n\nAs a slight update,on a return visit I had the chicken pollard and honestly would not have given 4 stars for this meal since it only is chicken with a dusting of dry sun dried tomatoes a few caper and a sliced olive around the plate. My dinner didn't come with a side or vegetable and left me underwhelmed. I will leave the rating at 4 stars since the other times I've been here it was 4 stars good and I would return but I'd never try the chicken pollard again.",1
I went here with a party of 6 on Saturday night.  Our table was ready and waiting when we got there which was nice.  It is an older place with tons of charm.  The place was pretty busy and you could tell that the waiters/servers/busers were clearly over worked.\n\nAfter sitting for about 10 minutes we had to flag someone down to get bread and place our appetizer order.  After that we only saw our waiter every 20 minutes or so so it was difficult to order additional items or to get soda refills.\n\nThe service was pretty blah but the food was excellent.  Everything I tried was top notch.  Everything was freshly made and delicious  Probably some of the best Italian cuisine around.  Definitely some of the best gnocchi I've ever had.\n\nI would definitely return but hope the service is better.,1
"I went there with my girlfriend on Friday night and had a pretty underwhelming experience. To start with, service was far too leisurely. Our server disappeared for ten minutes between every interaction right up until the final twenty minute wait to get our bill. The decor and vibe was a little uptight and there was no music. The lack of music and the half-filled restaurant set the stage for periods of awkward silence that made me yearn for the cool vibrant atmosphere of a Houston's. \n\nHere are the dishes we ordered with a small commentary and star ranking.\nGrilled Artichoke - Swimming in oil and just tasted of grilled olive oil *\nVeal Osso Buco - The veal is not bad but it was served with bland rice pilaf **\nLamb Shank - Not bad; tender braised lamb and onions on some bland spaghetti***\nSpaghetti Bolognese - The spaghetti was cooked perfectly and the sauce tasted good but the pool of oil on the bottom of the plate made for an unappetizing finish. ***\nEscargot - They tasted fine but they just seemed old-fashioned. They tasted just like the garlic butter escargot I had on a cruise ship in 1988. **",0
"Tried this restaurant this past Friday for the first time.  Fodor's called it the best restaurant in Phoenix, etc etc.  Someone told me they had a coupon for  two entrees, two salads or soup and a bottle of wine for $44. Sounds fair, right?  We were served two pieces of bread (one for each of us) with oil infused oil.  The one I make at home is better.  Not enough herbs to really flavor it.  We asked for more bread and they didn't seem happy.  Two pieces of bread again.  Never saw that before, counting the heads at the table and then matching the bread pieces. Most restaurant give you a chunk of bread and that's that. The salads were small, fresh but nothing special (what do you want for a coupon???)  The entree choices for the coupon were either pastas or chicken dishes everything is excluded unless you want to pay more.(what do you want with a coupon???) No side dishes come with it. You have pay extra.  (What do you want with a coupon?) I ordered chicken a la berto. Which had fontanelle cheese, spinach, and pancetta.  It was just ok. nothing special.  I didn't bring my magnifying glass to find the pieces of pancetta. (what do you want with a coupon???)  My husband hated his.  I tasted it. Flavorless.  It was chicken something. The word Oggi was in it  and his attraction to the dish was that it had sun dried tomatoes.  I think they took one sun dried tomato, cut it in half and then took that half and cut that half into minuscule pieces and spread it around the plate. As I said before, I didn't have my magnifying glass with me to let him see what mini- sun dried tomatoes look like.. My poor hubby, no sun dried tomatoes for you! (What do you want with a coupon?)  We ordered a side dish, for which we paid extra, of rigatoni with marinara sauce. Rigatoni was cooked al dente perfectly and the sauce was good.  But not better than the one I make at home from scratch from fresh tomatoes.  Don't you guys expect restaurant food to be better than your own?  I do. And finally, the bottle of wine. Not the best and a little vinegary.  (what do you want with a coupon?) \nI guess everyone knows the conclusion to this review.  If Fodor's called La Fontanella the best restaurant in Phoenix, then Phoenix is a very small town with very few italian restaurants.  I, for one, will not be going back with or without a coupon.\n\nBy the way, I have eaten at Bel Fiore's, an unpretentious, no white table clothed restaurant on Cave Creek and the food is one thousand times better.  And I don't need a coupon to eat there.",0
I really liked the family owned feel of this place. The staff was friendly and attentive and the pasta was amazing. Our waiter had no problem taking a special order and the price was VERY AFFORDABLE. I WILL BE BACK .,1
"Don't use coupon!  You ate looked down upon and treated poorly. Waiters are not pleasant, choices are spaghetti dishes and chicken dishes without spaghetti! Food was tasty, however, not worth the abusive attitudes. Will not return.",0
"skip this place. there are much better Italian restaurants in phoenix. \n\npros:\n(1) the food tasted OK (as good as Olive Garden)\n\ncons:\n(1) the decor was extremely outdated...it felt like a retirement home\n(2) way too much \""""mozzarella\"""" cheese on my entree \n(3) it felt like my food was not freshly prepared...perhaps it had been under a heat lamp for a while.",0
"OK Quick tip food service industry. If you are a smoker and bringing me my food, it is not only appreciated, but absolutely necessary that you defunk after your smoke sucking out back by the grease trap. I get it, brining me my bread is stressful, and you need your nicotine while you bitch to your coworker how I am only drinking water. However this literally makes me sick and sets an overall bad town for the entire meal. \n\nNot only that... But this place is 30 years old... They hired servers once and they have all been working there since.   Not that they were not kind, or attentive. Those parts were there, just a very old school approach. \n\nAs far as the food goes, nothing was that impressive either. We ordered the antipasto for two which was a selection of cured pork, olives, peppers, a caprese etc. The tomatoes tasted like they got them out of the dumpster at Wendy's and the meat was sliced a bit to think for the fat content. \n\nOn to the entrees, I got a red sauce, seafood dish, the diablo I believe, which was supposed to be spicy, it's spice factor was on par with Taco Bell's medium sauce. Also, they didn't clean the shrimp. I understand in the cafes of Paris (Say it like par-ee) they will serve head on shrimp that are fantastic, however 40th street and Indian School is a far way off from the Mediterranean. Also the calamari was excessively chewy, the muscles and clams were small and dry. However the fettucini was cooked very well and was actually pretty tasty. The dish was honestly Fazoli's quality on a good day. \n\nMy Fiancee got the chicken piccata and while I thought it was not to bad, she said she has had better in the middle seat of a Delta flight from New York. \n\nThe waiters presentation of the aged desert platter was tempting, however after our shitty food, we were over it. \n\nStay classy Arcadia.",0
"Great food in a very homey location. Set up as a cute local family style place, we tested it with my well behaved 3year old grandson. Most of the other diners were our age and enjoyed the young enthusiastic Italian eater. The staff went out of their way to show him a good time. \nAs for the food, excellent homemade pasta with a very delicious sauce. Meatballs were light and tasty, ravioli were homemade ade delicious. I had the veal parm which was great. \nIf you are in town for a meeting, give it a try",1
"I don't know where to start.  There were 3 of us for dinner Friday 3/8/13.  We arrived timely for our reservation, after requesting drinks, the waiter announced that he had \""""never heard of  that\""""; having tomato juice on the side of a martini.  Ok, moving on, Carl asked for blue cheese dressing, and our curmudgeon waiter's response was \""""are you crazy, you are in an italian restaurant, not french\"""" ?  How do you, as a customer, process this?  Next, the food came, salad, with the house dressing, awful and sweet, the mussels not fresh and the baked clams were good, however, complete with a piece of rock salt in the dish.  Off to a really bad start.  One special ordered piece of fish (frozen at best) and the shrimp scampi-greasy on a bed of fetuccini alfredo, and chicken piccata-looked like it was removed from the Delta business class kitchen, and tasted the same.  I must say, it would be hard to find a worse meal in Phx, anywhere for that matter, and this is one of the only times in my life that I left a 10% tip based on really rude service.  We almost left after the cocktail debacle, but foolishly stayed for the rest of the abuse to follow.  This place is way past its prime.",0
Probably the best Italian food I have had so far the in the valley. Our waiter was very friendly as well. This is more of a spot to bring your significant other then a group full of kids.,1
the gf and I came to eat here a couple of days ago and loved it. The entrees were excellent as well as the escargot appetizer. Service (Eric?) was great as well. The only thing that was average was their fried calamari.,1
"This place has the worst service. Don't expect your server to be pleasant at all. They look like they just hate serving people and that it's a bother. They seem to forget that it's our money that's keeping them employed. \n\nI requested another round of bread and that was almost 30 minutes ago. Our glasses are always empty, no one has checked on us and our entree is still MIA after almost an hour. We've been here over an hour and our water has been refreshed once without asking for it. \n\nWe weren't advised of the specials. I think our bread is burning in the oven, still no sign of it and I've seen several tables receive bread already. \n\nDon't ever come to this place I know I will never come back to this place ever again and definitely will make sure that this is not on the list of restaurants that we recommend.",0
We LOVED La Fontanella and were so sad to hear they had closed. A neighborhood gem that has been around for years and years. Bummer!,1
"This is where I go to get my car washed.  They do a good job, it's never a long wait and the prices are good.  The guys are always super nice to me.  Every time I've gone, I've gotten some kind of random discount.  I agree with the other reviewers.  Way better than Danny's.",1
"I took my car here for an advertised basic wash $8.99, I drive a 98 Jetta k2 model. Once I pull in they tell me they have to hand wash my car because I have a rack on top. Puzzled, because I have taken this car to\nDanny's, Olivia's and numerous other auto car washes and never had a problem, I inquire further. They then explain that my rack isn't factory so the hand wash will be $24.99.. Not factory? I ask.. the rack came with the car, it's a k2 model..That was the big selling point of these cars 10 years ago.. The guy continues to argue with me in a pretty hostile tone so I decide to go somewhere else. I drive less than 2 miles away and see another auto car wash, I pull in they give my ticket and wash my car in the machine for $11.99. I give Simoniz 1 star for having no idea what they are talking about and being rude in their ignorance.",0
"Every time I've been here, there is a problem. Today, I dropped my car off for an oil change and wash and asked them to call me when it was done. Two hours later (one hour at most was promised) I figured it should be done so I went to pick it up. I got there and payed with no event. It was when I drove down the street that I noticed the car hadn't even been washed! I returned and they said I needed to sign off on a waiver due to a loose piece of plastic under my bumper--no biggie but how was I supposed to know?!  In general, they don't embue trust to me and don't really seem to know what they're doing. \n\nThe manager explained that I needed to sign the waiver PRIOR to them washing my car. So here I sit waiting while they wash my car, yet still haven't signed said waiver?????  Told you, lots of excuses and false promises. I don't even trust they completed the services they signed off on.",0
"How excited can you get about a car wash joint? Well, not very! Yet, this place does a good job for $8.99. They're pretty thorough, includes vacuuming, and it looked like they sprayed some waxey stuff on my Wifey's black, Honda CRV... Looks great! They have a lovely inventory of greeting cards as well.",1
"They could not do an oil change on a 2010 Kia Sedona - no oil filter in spite of the two auto parts store in the same block. Friendly, but do some problem solving guys?",0
"I decided to go and get my truck washed on Saturday at Simoniz.  First  professional carwash it has had in about 2 years.  For $5 you get a basic wash and towel dry. No vacuuming done. Most of the other Wash-n-Go places let you vacuume your vehicle, but I'd rather have my vehicle towel dried. \n\nI pull in and the assistant manager says their having a special $29.99 detail (which includes their $19.99 deluxe wash). We talk for a few minutes and I state I don't want the armerol or air freshener or any of that stuff done to the inside of the truck. I just wanted the seat vacuumed. He said he will do the deluxe wash and shampoo the seats (which requires a wet vac that sucks out 90% of the water.) for $29.99. I ask how long all of this will take and am told 25-30minutes, tops. SOLD! My truck is 15 years old and has 15 years work of grime in the cloth seats. \n\nI walk inside and watch them pull my truck up to the ramp thing. Then watch it go through the wash, making sure all the special lights go one for the different treatments. I proceed to head on down the the cashier and pay. $29.99 on the card. Apparently, I got a pretty good deal because the cashier said, \""""WOW!\""""   I know how to deal...whatever.\n\nI make my way outside, pull up a chair to the table out there, and watch my truck pulled around to the detail area. I wanted to keep an eye on things. I was pretty much staring at my truck the whole time. My truck proceeds to sit for about 15 minutes before anyone begins on the detail. \n\n45 minutes later, my truck is \""""done\"""". \n\nI first inspect the outside of the truck. I notice there is still some soot on the tailgate from when we went camping last. I ask him to clean it off. He wipes his finger over it as if it was damage. Then notices that its not, and wipes it off with a cleaner. \n\nI open up the passenger side door and have a look in. I notice that the seats still look a little dingy and the area between the driver and passenger side wasn't even touched. I point this out to the guy who was doing the detail work. He says sorry for missing it and proceeds to use some cleaning (degreaser) solution and rub it out. I immediately say, \""""I was told that the seats would be shampooed and then a majority of the water vacuumed out. Was that not done?\"""" And he couldn't lie stating he used the wet vac, because I never saw anything of that type rolled over to the truck. The guy tells me that that process would take a lot longer. \n\nUM HELLO...I FLIPPIN WANT WHAT I PAID FOR!!! I don't give a sh*t if you have to take the time to do the job correctly. I refrained from saying that though. \n\nThe detail guy goes and gets the assistant manager and brings him back and the asst. manager asks if everything is okay. HELL NO. Things are not okay! After explaining what the (Fail to) detail guy did, the asst. mgr apologized and proceeded to get another detail guy on the job. \n\nJust because I was pissed, I decided to talk to the manager too. He said, he'd make sure everything was done over again and correct. LIKE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE THE FIRST TIME AROUND! \n\nTime at Car Wash now - 1hr \n\nFrankie did an awesome job on detailing my truck. He wanted me to inspect both the outside and inside before leaving. Everything looked fantastic!! I had wished Frankie would have done the detailing the first time around. The manager gives me a free wash but only after I asked for some form of compensation. \n\nTime at Car Wash now - 1hr 40mins \n\nI get into the truck to leave and grab for my key. Hmm... Its not in the ignition. I holler over to Frankie a car away and ask if he'd seen my key. He walks over and says, \""""Its not in the ignition??\"""" I bit my tongue as a \""""Here's your sign\"""" comment was nano seconds from leaving my mouth. \n\nMy key is officially MIA. I wasn't about to say, oh its just the spare...dont worry about it. HELL NO! I have a habit of locking my keys in my truck, so I need the spare!! Next thing I know, I have 6 guys around my truck looking for my key. This is the WORST possible thing that could have happened after the failed shampoo seats incident. I was LIVID and everyone within ear shot knew it.\n\nFinally my key is located. The person who drove it from the line to the detail area put it in the cupholder. Why would someone remove the key from the ignition!? Why not just leave it there? \n\nThe other assistant manager is one of the guys looking for my key. After it is found, he apologizes and gives me a book of washes and a free hand wax. Says that from now on to ask for him personally when I come in and he'll make I'm taken care of when there. \n\n\""""Warren\"""" is all clean and shiny, but with the hassle that I went through...I don't even know if I want to use the free washes/wax. \n\nTime at Car Wash - 2hrs",0
"This car wash is terrible, we paid for the works, they did not wipe the interior down. They left dirty spots all over the car the windows were not wiped down inside. To top it all off they never told us our car was done and left it sitting in the sun, it was like an oven when we got in. On the whole a really lousy job. Left no tip and would certainly not recommend.",0
"Would prefer to have my face gnawed off by rats than go here again. Quite possibly the worst experience of my life. Pulled in at 1058 told them I wanted everything, hand wash, wax, the works but I was on my way out of town so in a bit of a rush manager asked me if 30 minutes was ok I said yeah. 30 minutes later I went to check and found they hadn't started yet!!

"This is one of those in-between ratings. It's better than \""""Meh. I've experienced better\"""" and worse than \""""a-OK\""""\n\nIt's a convenient location for me, and it's easy one-stop shopping for oil changes and car washes. They also have a nice punch card system.\n\nBut you have to be INCREDIBLY careful here. Their whole game is the upsale. They aren't making money of $25 oil changes and $5 car washes. Their entire goal is to find something wrong with your car and charge you bloated prices for the repair. \n\nFor example, your transmission fluid may be fine. They will tell you need a transmission flush. They will notice a wiper blade that might be cracked, and they will charge you double the price of what you can get a blade for across the street at Autozone. I know enough about cars to not get sucked in, but I'm sure others have fallen  victim to this.\n\nAnd while we're on the subject ... it's really wrong the way repair shops play this game. They have really given their industry a horrible name by preying on people's fear of breaking down on the side of the road to upsale repairs that are often unnecessary.  Sorry for the rant, but I thought it was relevant here.",0
"Complete and utter rip off!  I bought tires from them, had a flat and they were going to charge my $25 to fix it!  I called Discount Tire and they fixed it for free.  Imagine that, a company that will fix another company's problem and for no charge!  \n\nThe other problem I had with this place was that they wanted to charge me $125 to read the fault codes off of my truck when your local auto parts dealer will do this for free!  \n\nEverything about this place irks me and they prey on people who are not auto savvy and they have gotten away with it for so long.  Please stay away from this place as they are way too expensive and will probably be the place to sell you something you do not need if they have the chance.",0
Dont know why i came back to this location a second time! This place suckkss & lack major customer service. An hour & a half & still waiting...for an oil change & i even scheduled the appt online!!!,0
"Super disappointed in the phone mannerism of the staff. Can you say \""""no thanks.\"""" The story:\n\nI found myself in Phoenix, AZ with two bald tires and I really needed to get new ones. The person on the phone was a JERK. He didn't listen even though I told him that I had the tire size off of my tire. He said, \""""It may not be the right size, just tell me what car you have you probably don't know what numbers I need.\"""" Why? Because I have a va-jay jay? Really!\n\nHe also said that the last person could have used the wrong size... really? I also bought those at a Firestone in San Diego, CA. Nice... talk bad about the people in your network.. makes sense.\n\nSo, I went to a different store where they were awesome. The reviews on this site are spot on for this location. Maybe Firestone should take note that the person answering their phone is an IDIOT and do better.",0
"This place is awful!!!!! I've been going to Firestone for yrs all over Arizona. Never ever had an issue until this location!!! Messed up my appts 3 times in one week. I've been here a total of 4 times this week!! Refused to top off all my fluids. Never heard of this before. It's your job!!!! When asking for my keys back, he refused. Then I asked the guys in the garage to give them to me and the GM told me \""""to stop being crazy!\"""" Excuse me!?! No. Never coming back here again!!! They will screw up everything!!",0
they are dishonest and liars. dont believe them. poor customer relationship. never will go again.,0
"I stopped by Pride Cleaners on Saturday and dropped off two suits and two shirts. Ended up costing about $40 which is a little more than I am used to spending, but they did a really great job and my clothes were ready to go on time.\n\nOpen until 6pm on weekdays works for me.",1
Arcadia cleaners was able to fix a disaster - last week my son's fiance pulled her wedding dress out of their car after traveling from Kansas to find it covered in green candle wax - I brought it right in to Arcadia cleaners and within 3 hours they called to say it was white again. We are all so thankful!!!! I'm telling everyone about how they saved the day!!,1
"It was over a year ago that this place ripped me off and I'm still upset about it. I dropped off a queen size down comforter thinking it would be nice to have it dry cleaned rather than hauling it to the laundromat. My husband goes to pick it up after work and hands it over to me when he gets home. I immediately say, \""""This is not our comforter.\""""  What they'd given to my husband was a queen size synthetic poly-filled comforter that looked like it just came from goodwill or had been used for many years as the roof of a fort. It basically looked and felt very cheap and like something you'd have around for the dog to lie on or to eat on for a picnic at the beach. . I called Arcadia cleaners right away and was told repeatedly that it was my comforter. They said that everything is tagged immediately when dropped off and my tag number matched my receipt. I was told that there are security cameras and I could come look at the tapes. I went the following day and was told over and over again by the owner that what I had been given was what I had dropped off. I showed him that on my receipt the employee had noted that what I'd dropped off was a down comforter and he said that must've been a clerical error. He showed me the security tape and it shows my comforter being tagged and carted off. I don't know how they did it but someone somehow replaced my cozy comforter with the piece of crap comforter that was sent home with my husband. The feelings of frustration and anger were so overpowering I began fantasizing about standing out front of Arcadia Cleaners with signs boycotting the place. What made all of this even worse was the owner was a total jerk. Totally full of himself. I hope whoever stole my comforter at Arcadia is cozy. It cost me $150 and a lot of time and energy. As a school counselor I have little $ and little time/energy to be dealing with stuff like this. Shame on Arcadia cleaners!",0
"Words cannot express how amazing this cleaner is! Recently I took my mothers 50 year old wedding dress (handmade by my aunt) in to get cleaned. The originally white lace jacket was almost brown, the vail was brittle and dingy, and the silk and satin dress was yellow. After meeting with the owner Mark I had every confidence in his abilities. I picked this up last week and the dress is amazing!  Everything was restored to its former glory and I have this company and its employees to thank for that.",1
"Ah, the little things I miss about living in Arizona.  For instance, the Chicago Hamburger Co.\n\nWhat a gem.  You'd drive right past this place without blinking an eye, just another dive place branding itself  \""""Chicago\"""" or \""""New York\"""".  NOT!\n\nThis is the best slider I've ever had.  Holy crap they are good.  Reminders of White Castle and Krystal burgers, except these are better.  In other words, it doesn't have to be 4am while trashed to make them taste great.\n\nThe fries???  PERFECTION.  That right combo of crispy on the outside, yet nice and soft on the inside, not overcooked, not undercooked.  The perfect fry.  It's beautiful.  It's art.\n\nWhere is Dorothy's slippers???  There's no place like home...there's no place like home...",1
"Sitting here thinking of my shitty Wendy's experience of late and wondered why I didn't go here. Also, why haven't I Yelped this place?!\n\nThe lil' bad boys are awesome! Juicy, salty and hot.. all the elements for a great burger.. plus they're so little you wont feel badly, even if you eat 6 like I did! The only thing I felt after that was satisfied!\n\nI cant give 5 stars because of their messed up hours.. WTF is 8pm as a closing time?!",1
"Life on a budget often dictates my taste.  When my now-former boyfriend would come home with a sack of Windy City Sliders, my excitement would be so pronounced that I'd be horrified at my own gluttony.  My inner fat guy knows what's up and what's up is two people eating four oversized sliders for around seven bucks (including drinks).  The rolls are fluffy and good, the meat is flavorful, I come here if I'm in the east Phoenix area nearly every visit.\n\nThey also have one of the loosest stuffed animal crane games I've ever played.  I enjoy emasculating my male companions by winning them a stupid plush toy, sometimes two.",1
"Great place to grab a slider.  Have a banana milkshake.  They're delicious.  The Italian beef is a great sandwich too.  Hot giardiniera is the best on top.  Service is always great here, but I recommend ordering ahead and carrying out at lunch time.",1
"This place is AWESOME. It's easy to miss and easy to ignore but once you venture in you'll be hooked for life. Parking is scarce during busy times and seating is limited inside, but it's well worth the wait. I regret I never had a chance to make one last visit before I moved out of Arizona.\n\nLove the fries, love the mystery cheese goo they put on their hot dogs, and of course, love the sliders. Better than White Castle and definitely better than that rip off place we have here in Orlando called Krystal.",1
"Let's get right to it.  The smell of GRILLED ONIONS hits you before you even touch the front door.  That is the definition of a Chicago dog/burger joint.  That IS Maxwell Street.  That IS Chicago.\n\nThe Food - I ordered the fire dog, a cheese slider, and fried zucchini.\nThe firedog didn't let me down in the authenticity department.  Good meat, the correct and required condiments (neon relish, celery salt, sport peppers, tomato, mustard, onion. and seedy seed bun), cooked just right, and it smelled up the office when I opened it.  \nThe slider was the ex-factor.  I saw 'slider' and immediately thought White Castles.  But I didn't want to compare it to that, so I slapped my head to get the thought outta there.  Its a little burger with mustard, onions, and cheese.  What makes it special is the way the meat's taste melds with the onions, mustard and especially the bun.  Mine had a little too much mustard...and the bun wasn't a player on the field at all.  In fact, the sub-par bunnage took away from the slider.  BUT, I said I wouldn't compare it to Whitey One Bite's (White Castle's), so for what it is...ITS GOOOOOOD!  You will find yourself wishing you bought 2 or 82 more of them.\nThe zucchini was just filler for the car ride back to the job.  They were greasy and crunchy enough to get me excited at first...but their charm wore off after about 5 of them.  They are little chips of zucchini fried nice and crispy.  The taste of the batter just didn't do it for me, and the flavor of the  zucchini wasn't quite on point.  Doh, I REALLY hate saying anything negative about this place, because of....\n\nThe Atmosphere:\nYou know what kind of place you're in when you open the door.  A joint.  Pure joint.\nChicago newspaper clips, posters, political campaigns, pennants, whatever you can take from Chicago and stick on a wall.  This is the first time I've walked into a Chicago joint and was actually MOVED.  The place made me a little misty.  \nI miss Chicago.  \nThis joint made me remember some of my happier times as a kid, when life didn't suck.\nIts the kind of place you go and sit down with your team or with your buddies or with your kids or with your ma or with your worse enemy.  The SMELL OF GRILLED ONIONS makes everything just fine with the world.  Its the kind of place you go after you've just had some kind of fun, or even some kind of heartache.  Its just the kind of place you can go whenever, for whatever reason.  You feel like you belong here; like the world's bitter and evil hands can't reach you here.  You feel...safe.  Sorry to go off on that tangent, but its just something about the actual establishment itself...\nWho cares about what the floors look like, or what's in the corners?  Its a joint.  Its got joint floors and joint corners and joint tables and chairs.  Ain't nothing crawling.  Nuff' said.\n\nThe Service:\nAfter my nostalgic head-trip back to Chi-Town, I had to let the guy at the counter know they had done right by me.  Not much conversation due to the uncanny line that seemingly popped up out of nowhere behind me.  He told me that when I call in an order, \""""Aw, you ain't gotta wait in line, just come on up.\""""  That was almost the equivalent of him saying \""""I love ya', man!\""""  Without the awkwardness.  Oh, when I said I was picking up for 'Mike'...they all went \""""Mike's here!  Got Mike here!  Get Mike's order!!!  Let's go!\""""  Maybe its a routine, but it makes a guy feel like a million friggin bucks in a recession.  Let's just say I walked out of there feeling 10 times better than I did before I walked in.  And lastly, an elderly lady came in, and they all knew her name.  The guy immediately asked if she wanted something to drink.  I don't know...that just sat right with me.\n\nThe Value:\nOn.  The.  Money.  I kid you not, you got 5 bucks, you can eat...and good.  Get a couple sliders and fries for under 5 bucks.  Or one of the dogs and fries.  You're looking at a little more for an Italian Beef (which I intend to trek back there for), or something like that.  Money is an issue for most people, but you won't hurt yourself having lunch here twice a week.\n\nThe Bottom Line:\nDespite the lack-luster experience with my zucchini and bun, I must say this:  Go here.  Go here often.  Smile when you get to the counter.  Tell them they have a nice place, even though they already know it.  Eat sliders.  Eat dogs.  Eat Frito Pie (and tell me how it was....while you stand a few feet away from me with that corn chip breath).  Sit down here.  Bring friends.  Bring people you don't know that much.  Bring people you don't like that much.  Just see how things turn out.  Your stomach and mouth will be happy.  Your heart will be happier, but perhaps out of a few years.  Write about it.  Talk about it.  Grab a few menus and stick 'em on the board at work.  \nThis place is all right.\nThis place is all right.",1
"I am a carnivore.  There, I said it!  I love burgers!!  So of course when I drove by Chicago Hamburger Co. on my first week here in Phoenix I said \""""note to self......MUST try this place!\"""".  Today marks my second week here in Phoenix and after a long week at my new job, I was hungry.  I picked up my daughter and we headed over.  \n\nFirst off if you are from Chicago or love Chicago, this is your place!  It is filled with memorabilia from the Windy City.  There are all sorts of street signs and things pertaining to Chicago plastered on the walls.  It's pretty cool.  They have two TV's and of course they had the Cubs playing on one of them!  Go Cubs!!  I like the sports like ambience.  It's nothing fancy at all, just basic tables and chairs and a few booths.  \n\nNow for the food.......Mmmmm good burger!  I had a wester burger.  For you fans of Carl's Jr. Western Bacon Cheeseburger....oh man, this one is far better!!  Real bacon right off the grill and cooked just right, nice and crisp, bbq sauce, cheese, and onion rings to top it off.  The burger was juicy and cooked just right!!  It was one of the best burgers I've had in awhile.  My daughter had a hot dog and scarfed it down and gave it a thumbs up so I knew it was good.  The onion rings were nice and crisp and I liked the batter they used.  Not super greasy either.  Nice!  The fries where crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside...perfect!  They have Pepsi and the other usual sodas.  They also make milkshakes.  I'll have to try one next time.  Oh, and chili cheese fries......omg....I love those!  \n\nAll in all this is gonna be one of my go to places here in Phoenix.  YUM!!!",1
This is your quintessential Chicago dog place.  They do a great job on all their dogs/sausages.  We also tried their sliders and Italian beef which were both good also but the Chicago dogs were definitely that thing to get here.  I would recommend this place to anybody craving a Chicago dog and sliders.,1
"Every Saturday my father would take me here when I was a kid and I would always order the same meal, cheeseburger, side of cheese fries, and a medium coke. As an adult this order has never changed. I highly recomend this place to anyone who wants to indulge in a good burger. My one regret so far is I still have yet to try a slider from here. Also the cheese fries are amazing! Enjoy.",1
I love this place.  Great sliders and thats the only thing I get.,1
I have not been here in years and am wondering why.  I thought I was back home in Chicago when I walked in. This place is the real deal!  Chicago memorabilia on the walls the help in red white and blue ( ala cubs) t-shirts... and oh yeah!  Great Vienna hotdogs with the nuclear green relish.  I also had a two cheeseburger sliders.  Very tasty as well.,1
"This place sucks!! I am from Chicago just recently sentenced to the valley, but I will tell you what, the food at this place is as authentic as a three dollar bill!! I mean they were rude, unfriendly, and their food reflected there attitude..it sucked! Owners let me tell you something just because you order a sign that say's \""""Chicago style\"""" and hang it outside doesn't mean that it is and you may be able to trick your Phoenix natives but true chicago folk should know the difference. The reality is that if you were on Clark st. Competing for business you'd last about 10 minutes before you went dark. Your food is bland and nasty. Your employees seem like extras from the movie \""""coma\"""" and look like they could use an FMLA day, and your place is unkempt and dirty. I pray that a white castle opens nearby and steals your handful of customers, it would not be hard. Next time I will take video of the place and the food as well as the staff and their attitude and post it on you tube for those who have any doubt. Finally, try using real Vienna giardinara peppers not your own creation because your way off. By the way, I will post a link to view your county health inspection for all to see!! Have a \nwindy city day buckaroo.",0
"Back in the day, my daughter loved to come here for the peanut butter shakes and a bite o' meat.\n\nYesterday, a chili cheese dog was a supermarket frank with canned, soupy chili and a tab for $7.85 (root beer in a styrofoam cup included).\n\nAtmosphere? None. Stuck-on mirror tiles with gold particles? Aplenty.",0
Tasty burgers and onion rings. Clean and friendly. I'd go back again.,1
Best sliders in town! I went here every week in HS. It gets busy though. Park around the corner. Great food and a wonderful family run business.,1
"I went here last night. I was SOOOO excited to FINALLY go to The Chicago Hamburger Co.. I have been driving past that place ever since I was little, but never got to go in. \n\nWell last night was the night. The hubs and his friend Josh have both gone a few times and rave about how awesome it is. I HAD to go! \n\nWell....It wasn't what I expected. I will give them that the service was friendly and we had our food in about 10-15 minutes. They were pretty busy, but it came quick. \n\nI got two double meat cheese sliders. I was only able to choke down one. The meat was not good at all, it tasted sour. The buns were really mushy. The grilled onions tasted like they had been made days ago and warmed back up. I pawned off my other burger on the hubs. \n\nWe all split a couple other things because I wanted to try it all. \n\nThe cheese fries....GROSS. They were soggy...like the fries tasted soggy before the cheese was ever put on. And the cheese had ZERO flavor, I wanted to dump salt and pepper all over it to give it some sort of flavor. anything. \n\nThe Frito Pie...Now I was way stoked that they had Frito pie on the menu. There used to be this hot dog cart in this industrial area that had bomb Frito pies and I hadn't had one in about 7 years. Well, the chili was disgusting. In all my life I have never had chili like the Chicago Hamburger Co. It tasted like a bag of sugar accidentally got knocked over into the chili as they were making it and they just let it ride. So so sweet...so un edible. \n\nThe Onion Rings...They were good. Nice and crisp. Really thin though and the batter they use isn't very special at all. But I would eat them again and be happy. \n\nOver all....Its mediocre. I would never ask to go back, but if the hubs really wanted to go there for sliders again, I would go and try something different. They have a turkey burger which sounds good. \n\nSorry Chicago Hamburger Co I really really wanted to like you.",0
"I've made several visits to the Chicago Hamburger Co, I was initially introduced by a friend who knew that I was originally from Illinois and missed some good old fashioned Midwest comfort food. My first venture there I tried their Italian beef sandwich, which really hit the spot. I got it with mozzarella and a side of red sauce, not exactly traditional but sometimes I just get that craving. It was pretty good on this occasion, the beef itself was kinda average but the bread was PERFECTION and I was pleased. Round two, not so much...it didn't stack up to the initial experience I had. My quest for the classic Italian beef in Arizona will continue elsewhere... Due to the failed Italian beef situation,  on my next visit I got a burger. Good, but nothing amazing. Visit number four found me giving the double cheese sliders a try, and I think I found my mainstay for this joint. While the regular double burger was a bit much and left me feeling like a fat bastard for the next 6 hours, two of these delicious little double cheese sliders did the trick perfectly. The fries are usually on point, I dump a healthy dose of Cajun seasoning on them as a rule. All in all, a pretty cool joint that reminds me why Chicago will always be \""""home\""""...",1
"I have to begin this by saying that I am not from Chicago.  The midwest, yes, but I have only visited, but given the crowds this place packs in, I had high expectations of the dogs and the burgers.  \n\nMy boyfriend said, \""""eh\"""" on the hamburger and I had the same opinion on the hot dog.  Nothing special and I have definitely had better - even at a roadside stand.  The service and atmosphere were great along with the prices, but I didn't feel like any of the food made me want to go back.",0
"I have literally been coming here for wings for the past 14 years. Yes even when I was younger. It's the only place I will go for wings.\n\nGrowing up I always loved going to Chicago's. My dad would take my sisters and I just for some wings. They still have the same baseball pinball machine which is always fun to play when waiting for your food.\n\nAs I got older, I didn't get as often until I got to high school. From there on, I always brought friends with me to Chicago's to try it out.\n\nI've been going often enough that some of the workers there know what I'll order. I have the same order of hot wings, extra ranch w/cheese fries and a large Pepsi.\n\nI haven't yet to expand on different food items, I've only had sliders, wings, cheese fries, shakes and hot dogs. The food is good and it's such a unique place.",1
"Just do yourself a favor and go here and get the sliders, they are fantastic!!  I think the soft and chewy roll is what makes them so damn addictive!!  I have actually never tried anything else on the menu because all I know is that when I go here all I want is sliders!!  The decor of this place is really cool as well.  All stuff Chicago sports.  Although I'm not a fan of Chicago I understand this place.  If a place like this existed in Phoenix that had all things Boston I would love it!  I really don't have much more to say though about the place since I have only tried one thing but I will say this.  The staff is friendly and if the the Cubs ever win the World Series, it's free sliders!!",1
"Great food! My husband got a couple sliders, a hotdog and fries and enjoyed every bite! I got a hamburger and onion rings and was very satisfied! I also really like their root beer shake. Blended perfectly! 4 stars all the way! :)",1
"Great onion rings, and the sliders are as close as you'll find to White Castle in Phoenix. Lots of Chicago memorabilia for fans of the Windy City.",1
"Been to this place only once.  Coming from Chicago the experience at this place was ok, but I've had much better.  Would not go again since I think there are better places out here.",0
"Used to make this a weekly stop, but the hot dog buns have changed, thus changing the whole taste of the dog. This being one of the true chicago style places in town, I found that to be disappointing. \n\nOn a positive note, the Italian beef is very good. I enjoy the unique style of hot peppers that they put on their sandwich. I also love the cheddar burgers here. Made just like they do in Chicago, using the thick spread style cheddar. Nothing could be better then a cheddar burger with grilled onions.\n\nGreatest thing about Chicago Hamburger is that it is always good food in your typical small place.",1
I am from Chicago and I feel places should be care full about trying to title there places with anything CHICAGO in AZ. Those are mighty big shoes to fill! With that said this place is totally over rated...I mean We got a hot dog served as a sandwich....NOT IN CHICAGO!!! For this I will stick to what the Valley is  known for and go to In and Out or Lenny's!!! Quit it!!!!!!!,0
"Never been here before most likely because I rarely get to this end of town.\n\nHad a chicago dog and a couple of sliders.\n\nDog was good albeit the celery salt was a little salty for my tastes...and I like salt.\n\nSliders were good...somewhat reminiscent of white castle.\n\nFries were fries.\n\nSoda was soda.\n\nOverall pretty good.  Would eat there again, just gotta get to that end of town.",1
"I live right down the street and this is one of the best places to swing by (off hours are the best because it's not as busy) and just pick up a bag of sliders to chow down on.  Hadn't heard about the \""""Philly style\"""" cheesesteak; I'm going to have to try that out soon!",1
"I was excited about this place after reading all of the great reviews, but this place didn't live up to the expectations.  I ordered a Cheddar Burger and a Vienna Hot Dog.  The burger was awful; it had no flavor whatsoever.  In-N-Out blows this place out of the water, which is kind of pathetic because that's just fast food.  The hot dog was better than the burger, but it was just average.  I'm not sure that this place is worth returning to.",0
The burger and fries are nothing special....but not bad.  Be prepared for patties cooked in old grease.  The fries taste like frozen pre-packaged from sams club.\n\nParking is scarce.,0
"The place has an awful smell, the condiments table is super dirty, and my Chicago beef was lackluster",0
"When I miss my sweet home Chicago, I make a bolt for Chicago Hamburger Co.  Sure the hell beats dropping a G on round-trip tickets!\n\nSliders are a buck.  Same idea as White Castle, butt this joint is easier on the butt.  Chicagoans or anyone who has tried whiteys will know what I mean.\n\nThey're served on soft fresh buns with fresh onion and pickle.  The fries are damn good and don't taste like they were just pulled out of a freezer.\n\nDon't leave without trying a Chicago style Italian Beef with sweet and hot peppers.  The bread so super soft and fresh and all of the peppers taste like they were made right there in this dive... in fact, I think I could see a bowl of fresh peppers from the counter.  \n\nService is good and the environment and decor can't be beat!  All Chicago, everywhere!  Stuff you don't normally find in AZ, these guys know Chicago.",1
"This place is amazing. cheap but great food and really nice staff.  the place has a great atmosphere with old Chicago stuff.  Their hot dogs are great. I personally love the chili dog.  The sliders are great too and  the french fries are the type that are amazing when warm but are still amazing when there cold.  You can also get authentic cheese fries, which accordingly to my girlfriend (a Chicago native) is nearly impossible in Phoenix. This is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. We go to it at least 3 times a month.",1
"Ehhh... Kind of expensive for what you get. Burgers are soggy and the fries taste like they are cooked in old oil. Place is kind of dirty and parking is a nightmare.  Nothing special here, especially for the price. $10 lunch for a burger, fries and a drink. Also the dining room is pretty much standing room only for lunch. No thanks.",0
"Food just OK.  Health inspection was a \""""B\"""".  Doesn't look clean.  Makes you wonder!",0
I love this place. The chili fries are AMAZING! The best peanut butter shake I've ever had. Get it and you will not be disappointed.,1
"The food was great, the customer service was horrible! I called in an order and asked for it to be split into three. When I arrived to pay the man at the register basically scolded me telling me he wasn't going to make other people wait in line while he split my order. The person on the phone did not tell me this was a policy. I won't be back. He was rude and it was completely uncalled for. Maybe the person taking phone orders needs some training!",0
Great sliders! Went here for lunch yesterday with a friend of mine and we used a Groupon. It's not the first time I've been as whenever I'm craving a slider this is where I head to. I love their cheese sliders and french fries. Yesterday I tried a new menu item - garlic fries. They were okay but I don't think I would get them again. If you are into Chicago's sports teams then you would love this place. All the walls are covered with Chicago sports team memorabilia. You do have to get here early as the place fills up quickly but they do get the orders out fast. They have great prices and it's a good value for lunch.,1
"Ehh! It's ok! The decor in the place is awesome! The walls are covered with anything and everything Chicago, obviously. The food wasn't that great :/ heard good reviews about the place and just wasn't \""""wowed\"""". I ordered the sliders which the lady at the counter recommended as a favorite. She also told me to order more than one since there was just a 1 ounce hamburger patty on each. Didn't taste any better than McDonald's, to be honest. The friend I was with ordered some type of polish dog, I think, which he said was good. The fries looked good but I can't say I've ever complained about a fried potato.",0
"They close at 8 but will serve the person in front of you if they know them and the doors are unlocked at 8:30. Oh, and while the place is packed and you're not the only on in live willing to pay. A+ customer service.",0
"I would not go back for the Sliders or Beef Items.   I ordered the following(TO GO) on 2 Saturday afternoons 1 week apart:\n\nChili - There was sugar in the Recipe.  I did not like.\nSliders - Something sweet in the Meat, Perhaps sugar.   Nothing like White Castle.  If you are seeking the White Castle experience you will be dissappointed.  \nColeslaw - Raw Onion is in abundance and takes away from the very fresh Cabbage.  If they get a handle on the Onion they have a winner.\n\nWings -  Basic\n\nHot Dog - Basic - however the Poppyseed Roll was very fresh and the French Fries(although standard frozen potatoes) were delicious and cooked perfectly, both times.\n\nBiggest dissapoinment:   The Philly Cheese Steak.  There is something that is giving the meat items a bad taste/odor.   I really doubt the meat is old due to the Restaurant is quite busy.  Perhaps it is how they store the items as a strange undeterminable odor is getting into the Bread or Meat.  I ordered twice on busy Saturday afternoons.  Meat/Bread Items had the same Odor.   It is not a dirty odor. \n\nNevertheless, I would only return for the $4.85 Hot Dog which comes with French Fries.",0
Amazing for what it is...sliders and the banana shake can't be beat...best shake in arizona. Spend the extra 60 cents for the banana upgrade.,1
Maybe the best Chicago-style hot dog in the city.  Hot thick fries.  The banana milkshake is a winner.  Friendly counter staff and fast service.  Fun old Chicago sports and Blues decor. Parking can be difficult at lunch.,1
This place is legit !!!  Best burger I have had in 9 years in the Phoenix area. Great neighborhood spot full of Chicago pride which is evident from all the pictures and memorabilia on the walls. \n\nI had full intentions on showing a pic of my burger but I inhaled it. 2-3 cheddar with lettuce pickle spicy mustard and ketchup. Absolutely loved it. \n\nAnytime I am in the area I am coming back. Do yourself a solid and get down here.,1
"Great place. The sports decor on the wall really sets a fun atmosphere. I had the firedog with the amazing neon green relish and it was awesome. Also tried the special of the day which was sloppy joes, which were the best I've ever tasted. They were completely unique and tasty. The service was precise and quick. Definitely recommend.",1
Love their sliders! Everything is good here. Recommended.,1
"This place has Chicago Flair written all over it!!! The inside was filled with sports memorabilia galore from the famous Windy City. Arcadia for me has become an area of Chicago transplants and the food followed.\n\nI had the cheeseburger sliders, root beer float and onion rings. All delicious and left me wanting more. The quality was really good and everything tasted fresh.\n\nI also had their thick shake on my second trip here. I tried the chocolate peanut butter banana milkshake. It was creamy, dense and smooth. The shake was one of the best shakes I've ever had.",1
"This place has been around forever. I remember going here as a kid. I usually get a Chicago Dog or sliders with cheese. Bob is great!\n\nDrawbacks..... Parking is a pain, very small parking lot. The place is also a bit small & run down. But don't let that stop you from enjoying the best sliders in town! I drive in from Goodyear to eat here, that's how good they are.",1
"Faster, less expensive and friendlier than jiffy lube. I was in and out in less than 20 minutes.",1
"Came here on Ladies $5 off Wednesday so my charge after taxes was $33.87. They told me 20 mintues and 20 mintues later they were done with my car, awesome! While the short time I was waiting they did offer free fountain soda and coffee. They were nice and didn't try to hit on me like some of these cheap oil service places (I don't have a big ego , I'm positive it happens to most women who walk into those places). Also they top off most of my fluids and didn't sel to sell me anything extra like an air filter. Though they did suggest I needed to replace my wiper blades (but honestly that's because they really do need to be changed but not at $12.99 a blade in this city. Not only did they clean the outside of my windows but ALSO vacuum my floors, too cool. The only thing I question is that on my service information under Spare Tire, the cashier put Checked OK. Now, it is very hard to get to my spare tire, you have to a trick to jimmy the lock open since they key hole broke off on the glove compartment(don't ask) and that's where the release open button is and the lock on the outside is broken so really nobody can get into my trunk without me showing them how. Hmm, did you REALLY check? I'll come back, but you better believe I'm questioning how they \""""checked\"""" it. Otherwise, good place.",1
"Fast is fast..But faster is fastest. Avis, whom has no website or real web presence, is a quiet little  oil change spot whom is doing a damn good job....and fast. Let me go further...\n\n~The Good~\nSo fast. They change oil like Usain Bolt runs laps. Thats fast. I am trying to set a record for usage of the word \""""fast\"""" in a Yelp review. I might have already hit it, which would be super fast. But not as fast as Avis. It took them about 20 minutes to do my change, which included topping off of fluids, lube, filter change, and a general inspection. They also cleaned out the front seat and vacuumed it. This sounds too good to be true, but it isn't. They are efficient and fast, like a cheetah on the prowl.\n\n~The Bad~\nIn the day of the Almighty Groupon (praise be unto him) a $42 oil change sounds like a lot. But I did get the high-mileage oil change, which increased the rate. Overall, this is the worst thing about the place. Most people, though, will gladly pay a couple extra bucks to get out of the place without getting up-sold by some grease ball and on with their life.\n\n~The Downlow~\nPrice matters to me, but so does the commodity we are talking about. The commodity here, is oil changes....fast. They also checked my fluid levels properly, as well as lubed me up and checked general maintenance. Well worth the price. They get 5 stars for speed of service, efficiency, customer service, speed of service (again ;-D ), and array of services. They offer more than just a simple oil change: they offer a fast oil change with great service and a number of other maintenance items or suggestions if needed. They get the Jefe Endorsement of Awesomeness! Stop in, this place rocks!",1
"Baker Nursery is a Phoenix institution.  The original Mr. Baker is now 86 years old (as of 2008), and still lives on the premises, although his daughters and the other employees do most of the work.  It's frequently a busy place, but they always have time for a chat and whatever friendly gardening advice you may need.   The selection of roses especially (during the proper planting time in the spring) is first class.  The prices are somewhat higher than the big-box stores, but because the plants are well cared-for they are more likely to survive, and you can feel proud to be supporting a real honest-to-goodness family business that has been decades in the making.",1
"There are certain neighborhood staples that exist in any area. Baker's is that kind of place. I have been going to their nursery for more than a decade. When I drive by, they do a good job reminding me to \""""FEED CITRUS NOW\"""". I need that kind of thunk on my head. We also went to them to make our wedding gift take aways. We asked our guests to plant a tree to mark our special occasion and to help us make roots. Our guests have told us how those tiny little trees have really grown in a decade. Bakers had surprised us by nicely wrapping them up. From then on I was a believer. There are bigger, national sources but you cannot beat a sweet little place in your area, who knows your plants and the needs we have unique to Phoenix. Go take a stroll around, you'll find everything you need.",1
They have all their roses in now. We got the Cecille Brunner Climbing Rose bush and the Jean La Joie. They look healthy and are already starting to leaf out. Can't wait to see the show of roses in a year. They have a huge selection available right now but are selling out like crazy. So go fast if you want roses for your garden. Ideal time to get them in the ground is now.,1
"I like veggies but I don't like buying them. Following this simplistic logic trail I decided to plant a garden. Since I don't know a damn thing about gardening I sought out some professional help. To the Baker Nursery! \n\nI could easily spend an entire day wandering through the nursery. The place is huge, with an amazing assortment of indoor and outdoor plants, flowers, trees and veggies.  The quality of everything was great, everything was healthy and well tended.\n\nThe vegetable selection is fairly extensive and very reasonably priced. In no time at all I had the beginnings of a nice little garden picked out. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable, answering the questions that I had. \n\nThe garden is really coming along, I picked my very first strawberry yesterday. Thank you Baker Nursery!",1
"I love Baker Nursery! Their selection of plants is superb and the plants always look fresh. The staff is always very nice and helpful. And I love the atmosphere...sounds weird for a nursery, but it is very homey. It is as if you are walking into somebody's back yard...which is almost true. I believe that the house next door is the owner's property.\n\nI remember my mother bringing me here as a child - I always had so much fun there. She brought me here because she also used to go there as a child! Baker's has been around for so long and is a wonderful family business. You should go check it out!",1
"Have purchased trees here,tagged them,only to have them sold out from under me later.  Won't go there again, no matter how good the staff is. Miss the old owners. Kids don't count.",0
What a find!  A gardeners paradise!  A friend turned me on to Bakers and I was thrilled when I went.  A hidden gem in a neighborhood setting - so much better quality than the big box nurseries at a Home Depot or Lowes.  Gardners - go to Bakers - you will be so happy!  I promise!,1
"Bakers is the best from plants to those concrete gnomey kind of things that can inhabit your lawn and garden.  I have been going to Bakers for about 54 years.  When I was a little child I went with my mother, a woman who could literally grow anything and did, in the AZ heat.  The result I have seen just about any situation you can think of being dealt with using Bakers, successfully most of the time.  Truthfully, I have always had such a good experience here that anytime I have used anyone else, I end up returning.  They just can't be beat.  They answer your questions nicely about their tremendous supply of just about anything at any given time.  If your desire to garden never goes past house plants, they are just as much for you. They won't lie to you about what they sell. Don't expect to go home  from Bakers with what you planned on.  It will usually be more.",1
"A local favorite.  Baker family owned.  Anything you need to know, they grow.  If you wonder if a plant grows in full sun, that's where they stock.  Amazing selection of plants and trees.  5 star staff.  I have brought in a plant clipping and they will tell you EXACTLY what you have.  6 stars if possible for this place.",1
"Just lost my business.\n\nI have shopped at Baker Nursery for 7 years.  Most of the time the staff is helpful but on occasion they can be curt.\n\nLast week I purchased 3 \""""Raspberry Fuzzy\"""" plants. I have 7 already growing in my yard and have had them for several years.  I wanted a few more so I purchased them at Baker Nursery.  5 days later they are dead.  I didn't even have the chance to get them planted.  These are very drought resistant plants.  I watered them while still in the pots, but not everyday as this would kill them.  \n\nToday I returned them to Baker Nursery.  One woman looked at them and said I killed them and walked away.  I stood there rather dumbfounded for a few minutes thinking about what I would do.  I decided to go inside the store and tell them what happened but also that they had lost my business.  So I did.  I received essentially the same response from Bonnie, one of the owners.  All she could say was, \""""well.\""""  \n\nI have been gardening for over 50 years and I am familiar with this plant.\n\nThis is an incredibly poor business practice over $15 worth of plants, but clearly after talking to two individuals this is their manner company policy for treating customers.\n\nAgain, Baker Nursery, you have lost my business.",0
"You have 100% lost my family's business! I would love to give 0 stars!! So much for trying to support local businesses. I bought $75 worth of Gardenia's for our backyard wedding. The woman was very helpful and even carried them to my car {great service when you are spending $$$$}. Not even 24 hours after planting them, into a pot with the same normal soil I have planted all of my other plants and dwarf trees in, they were wilted and dying. My husband took one of them back to the nursery and upon arriving an employee says \""""well how'd you kill that plant\"""" in an extremely rude tone. My fianc\u00e9 was so shocked he wasn't sure how to respond. He went on to tell the lady and the manager what had happened and their reply was simply \""""you're fault, too bad\"""". I can't believe that after spending $75 at this place that they wouldn't even offer to help fix the problem. My fianc\u00e9 asked if they had a guarantee similar to Home Depot who will replace the plant within 90 days of purchase. In a rude tone again she replies \""""nope guess you better go to Home Depot\"""". Really?!? All of these business owners who are begging for customers and promoting local business, but won't do ANYTHING to help customers out. I am utterly disappointed and will NEVER go back again!!! \n\nI also can't believe the other negative comments on here and absolutely no response from the owners!!  I hope everyone on my Facebook reads and shares this post.",0
"I've been a loyal customer here for years and even highly recommend this nursery to every gardener I meet in person or talk to online forums. But today they have totally changed that.\n\nI went over there to buy some giant timber bamboo. They had some in 3gallon sizes so I picked up two of them. One was marked $72.95 and one was $58.95. I asked the lady that was at the front about why one is priced more than the other, and she said because one was probably bought from a different vendor even though they were the exact same size! So then I asked if she can sell them both to me for $58.95, and told me that she can't do that. I was shocked! Any other store or nursery would have jumped on the opportunity to create a loyal customer in this situation before I had even asked if they can honor the lower marked price! This is just terrible customer service! \n\nI ended up forking up the money for both anyway since I really needed them for my backyard. But this is definitely the last time I'm ever giving them my business and won't be recommending them again to any people.",0
"I've been going to Baker for about 8 yrs now. I like the nursery...they have a very good selection of succulents, starts (veggies, herbs), and a decent selection of trees, vines and desert-adapted plants. I wouldn't recommend them if you are looking for natives however because the selection is small.\n\nOver the years I've bought a lot of plants and trees here...and I've only had a few die...most recently, 4 out of 5 pedilanthus I bought (lady slipper plant) died almost immediately after bringing them home. When I went in to Baker to talk with them about it, they were unapologetic, unhelpful, and rude. They said they don't guarantee their plants at all...it was my fault completely and I killed them. I was upset, yes, but I kept going back and resigned myself to having just lost about $100. It is after all, a local nursery close to my home and maybe I did do something wrong...I'm not perfect.\n\nWe started getting serious about landscaping our yard a year ago, and I wanted more natives and desert plants. Since Baker didn't have them in stock, I requested them by writing down the item and giving it to the cashier who then would give it to the person who orders plants. I did that three times over about 3 months. No response. I tried to call...sometimes they don't answer the phone. I stopped by. No one ever responded to my requests.\n\nSo I finally went to other nurseries around the valley to find natives. It was then that I realized what I'd been missing at Baker--good customer service with a smile. Baker's staff seem disgruntled or crusty most of the time--even the 20-somethings that work there never have a smile to greet you.\n\nThe last straw: I've been asking around at all the nurseries for a certain plant called Rabbitbush. It's a Chihuahuan desert native related to our Sonorant desert's turpentine bush. I want several for my yard and I can't find them anywhere in Phx (most nurseries are supplied with desert plants through a wholesale company called Mountain States and I knew already that they didn't have it in their inventory.) I'm not an expert at plants, but I did my research on this bush and I knew what I wanted. I went to Baker about a week ago to get some succulents and while I was there, I asked about Rabbitbush. They didn't have it in stock of course but I could leave a note for Joy, the gal who orders plants. I thought, \""""yeah, right, no one will call me back\"""", but urged by the salesperson who said they sometimes order plants from Civano in Tucson, I wrote out the request: \""""5 Rabbitbush, Ericameria nauseosa var. nauseosa\"""" and left it with no expectation of hearing back.\n\nI got a call a few days later saying they got it them in. Thinking that was too quick, I called back several times and finally they picked up. I was transferred to Joy. I asked her what she had ordered and she told me Ericameria nauseosa. Yeah, but which one, I asked. The one you requested she replied. I asked her about the exact botanical name, at which point she got annoyed and told me again she'd gotten what I requested. I tried to ask whether it was the subspecies nauseosa or speciosa but she told me that Mountain States shortens the names on the sticker (shouldn't she have asked whether it was the right plant prior to buying it or calling me?). Sensing this was about to be a repeat of the Pedilanthus conversation where I was the one that was at fault for daring to question the all-knowing Baker staff, I quit trying to explain it and asked, \""""does it say Whitestem chamisa on the bucket?\"""" \""""Yes.\"""" I told her there was a difference between chamisa and Rabbitbush in the subspecies name, but she just said \""""do you want them or not?\"""" No thanks was my reply and we hung up.\n\nYes, maybe I'm just a customer and maybe I haven't worked at a nursery, but I know what I'm talking about on that one. I will probably go back to Baker at some point and I think it's a good nursery for Phx folks to check out at least once. But, if you go, set your expectations low:\n1. Expect to be treated poorly. Don't expect them to be nice to you or give you any respect, even if for one moment you know more about a plant than they do.\n2. Buyer beware: if a plant dies, it's your fault, not theirs and don't ask them about it because you will be told that you killed the plant in a rude tone of voice.\n3. Help yourself. Don't expect them to go out of their way to help you. (We have a hard time getting anyone to help us get our plants to the register.)\nWith low expectations, if anything goes right for you at Baker, you'll think it's great.",0
"Best nursery in Phoenix. Great selection of plants for shade and sun, helpful staff, bulk topsoil, pretty much everything you could want for the garden. Baker and Berridge definitely the best.",1
"I purchased a Banana Tree from Baker's on 06/15/2014.  It wasn't in very good condition to begin with and they only had 2 others.  The salesperson indicated that if it didn't do well that I could bring it back.  On 7/29/2014 I took the plant back in the pot it came in and with the receipt.  Baker's refused to give me another Banana Plant, give me my money back or give me a credit for another plant.  This family owned business needs to be bought out by someone with some ethics.  I will never shop for plants there again and I have reported them to the Better Business Bureau.",0
"They are going out of business.  Can't compete with Home Depot and customer service was always pretty bad, too. I remember the last time I was here in the August and I asked one of the clerks if she'd already swiped my credit card. She laughed and said: \""""we don't do computers here,\"""" with a sense of pride. And now you're out of business.  Go figure! LOL.",0
"Cute place for consistent neighborhood Thai. They handle all the usual suspects quite well, and the thohd mahn (fish cake) and yahm neua nahm tohk (spicy beef salad) are super.",1
"Great Thai cuisine prepared by a family staff in nice surroundings. The best Thai in our neighborhood, maybe even in this part of Phoenix. Parking is easy and convenient. Call first if you don't know the schedule as they go back to Thailand now and then for visits.",1
"Probably the best Thai restaurant in the valley save for Malees on Main, which is double the price. I have been to Thailand many times, and Thai Lahna represents true, authentic Thai cuisine like what you would find on the streets of Bangkok. Clean flavors, good preparation, friendly staff. \n\nThis family run restaurant is a pleasant change from the chain eateries so common in Phoenix. They have beer and wine",1
"Thai Lahna, is probably one of my most favorite Thai food restaurants in the valley.  Thai Lahna has been in the valley for over 25 years and once you've been in there to experience the food, you will know why.  One thing I wasn't especially thrilled about was the server we had.  She must have been having a bad day.  But other than that - it was DEEEEEE-licious.  My favorite thing on the menu is number 81 and the Red Curry Chicken.  The soup.  Oh YEAH.  If you have wimpy lips - you will definitely want to order it less than medium.  If you are good with spicy - medium is good.  But if you are a pro and I'm not sure I could ever go there - but hotter than medium would send me packin'.  The atmosphere in this quaint little restaurant is comfortable... nothing really GREAT... I would prefer some mood music, rather than silence, but it was nice.  Again - the food is definitely worth it!!",1
"Best Thai I have found in Phoenix, so far.  This is not just excellent Thai food for Phoenix, this is excellent Thai food for the Bay Area.  It's that good.  Thai Lahna's food will intrude into your thoughts for days after you eat here.  Like gustatory flashbacks, you will find yourself thinking about how wonderfully flavorful everything was.\n\nWe had dinner here with Christine O & Myles (+1) and shared 2 appetizers and 4 entrees.  We had Chicken Satay and Angel Wings.  The Satay was the least interesting item we had, it was merely good.  Everything else was great.\n\nOur entrees were Phaht Thai which we ordered with no spice and Khung Nahm Prik Pow which was sauteed shrimp with roasted curry paste, onions, chili, bell peppers and mushrooms.  Our friends ordered a spicy pineapple fried rice and a beef dish which I can't recall the name of.  All of the dishes were richly flavorful and had plenty of sauce to carry over to the steamed rice.\n\nOne enjoyable highlight was the point counter-point going from the spicy heat of the rice to the almost sweet sauciness of the Phaht Thai.  We can't wait to get back here and try more dishes.\n\nMy only complaint about this place is that they need to put some sort of tinting on the windows to a height of about 3 feet.  When cars are pulling into the spots right in front of the restaurant some diners were blinded by the headlights.",1
"When I have a hankerin' for a new Thai place, I contact Chris T.  He recommended Thai Lahna and I am a bit perturbed that it's so close to my house.  You see, I go pretty often.  Like twice a month.  \nI always get the #35, which is a peanut dish in a brown sauce.  It's orgasmic.  Seriously.  It comes with chicken, but you can substitute tofu, which is key in my book.  \nStaff is very friendly, though I almost always get take-out.  I drool as I drive home with my bag neatly closed, smelling it down Indian School.",1
"When it comes to Asian style privately owned restaurants, most of them run into each other for me. Thai Lahna, on the contrary, is in a league of it's own. The scene is what any would expect, and the service is curt, but the food is what you're coming for, right? The portions are generous, with no shortage of protein. The sauces are so far above average, it makes the entrees at other local restaurants taste like happy meals.\nI'm not kidding here, if they only offered their sauces over rice I would still go as much as possible. But let's not detract from the content, all ingredients are cooked to perfection. The bamboo shoots have never been too firm. The chicken has never been too tough. The scallions never wilted. \nDown sides: table-side manner (servers are all about the business here), only canned sodas, long wait when it's busy (but it's hard to hate on a place that is too busy), how full you are for hours after leaving... ENJOY!!!",1
"Disappointing, but I have to preface by saying that my taste is spoiled by the diverse Thai restaurants in Southern California (LA and SD), so my standards may not be representative of Scottsdale. \n\nWe ordered: \nBeef Pad See Ewe (missing that \""""pan-fried\"""" taste, it's soggy and too salty) \nChicken Pad Thai (sauce was not infused into the noodle) \nGreen Curry (okay) \n#29 Pork dish (i think)--too oily \nThai Tea-- Decent \nFried Rice--They ran out of crab so we got the chicken instead--nothing to write home about \n\nNo mango with rice because they were out of season. Sob Sob \n\nWe really had high hopes, but were left high and dry, plus an uneasy feeling of grease in our tummies...Sorry to contradict the high ratings, but if you are a spoiled brat and come from the land of diversity, you too will understand. :)",0
"One of the best Thai Restaurants in Phoenix. Nothing fancy from the outside, but inside provides an authentic vibe, great service and amazing food at good prices. The new website (includes photos of dishes) helps with take-out ordering. The Pad Thai and #35 on the menu are a must.",1
"I was a bit disappointed by this little place, as I've heard so many good things. I always order the same dish at every Thai restaurant (pad Thai) so it gives me a good basis for comparison.\n\nThe pad Thai here was a bit soupy, and was severely lacking in veggies. It didn't come with tofu either, which was too bad (all of the other vegetarian dishes did, however). It seemed to be made up of sauce and bean sprouts, with a few noodles thrown in. \n\nI wouldn't rush out to this place. There are plenty of other phenomenal Thai joints around.",0
"Talk about a stomach ache.  Too bad I can not give this place a 0 or negative star review.  First off, I have eaten very authentic Thai food in Thai Town in Hollywood.  The prices are dirt cheap and the food is excellent.  This place the food was more pricey and I had tremendous stomach and digestion problems the next 3 days!  My best friend who is Thai thinks that the curry I got lacked the curry.  Thai curry has the peanut sauce and curry base.  He thinks I got all peanut and no curry.  Just thinking how much peanut I might have ingested makes me want to puke right now.",0
"Me want to likey likey but no can do. \n\nI'm disappointed in this place and the 4-star rating it got. How misleading. I should have known this place was no good when I didn't see a single Thai person in the joint. Don't tell me they were all in the back cooking either. Its like walking into a Mexican restaurant and all the wait staff were Chinese. Well... now its sounding like ChinoBandito. Anway--- I digress.\n\nI came in for lunch and the menu was expansive! I've never seen so many words that begin with K.  I wanted to try something different than my regular pad thai, curry, tom yum but I couldn't decide and went off something from their lunch menu. I think it was Thai bbq chicken with spicy sauce. I figured, I can't go wrong with that. Not traditional Thai but I couldn't make up my mind about the others. \n\nWell, they ran out. I wasn't sure if they ran out of Thai bbq or chicken. Apparently its bbq so I settled for the sesame chicken. Bad idea. When in Thai- I should probably order Thai... but... um.. how do you screw up sesame chicken? The Panda Express has mastered it! Now you!\n\nIt will be a while before I try this place out again but I just didn't expect them to not be able to cook. I will start at a one-star for now and promise to order an authentic dish next time so I can be a better judge.\n\nI did have the thai milk tea and that was good. So one-star for good tea!",0
"Best Thai in Phoenix in my opinion.  I love their extensive menu and the service is great.  The Chef here cooks ALL the time, so the food is consistent and wonderful.  Try the Phat Thai is the best I've ever had (and I've had a lot of Phat Thai).  Always clean and has a fun and funky interior design.  Enjoy!",1
"This place has such good food.  The Thai curry is great.  Only issue, you have to ask the wait staff to fill up your water or drinks as they must think that Arizona is scarce with water.  I would give them a 5 star but I just can't because of the waitstaff.",1
"much overdue review, but...\n\ni guess it doesn't matter what was ordered here, because somebody has a heavy hand as far as salty condiments are concerned, so dishes are peculiarly salty, and it is possible that while en route to our table, someone surreptitiously powdered the food with yes, even more salt. flavor isn't necessarily bad, but if you didn't know, i prefer a blend of flavor(s), not just a flavor (salty). \n\nif you are luckily having salticious cravings, and would like to experience edema and other related salt and water retention, this is a great place.",0
"This place is the equivalent of salt lick Thai. I could taste very little else over the heavy hand with the sodium in the kitchen. None of the mouth watering aromatics that normally characterize Thai were detectable either. Sorry basil, lemongrass, coconut milk and galanga. \""""Mixed vegetables\"""" consisted of bamboo shoots and green beans (very adventurous), and the bamboo shoots were undercooked and mega crunchy. Hot apparently translates to a mild tingle on your tongue, so don't go expecting to sate your Scoville craving. And to top it all off the portions we received were meager for the prices. \n\nI might have caught them on a bad day, but there's much better Thai to be had in the valley. Even though I live in Arcadia, I don't think there's any way I'm coming back.",0
"I thought I try out Thai Lahna based on the many positive reviews.  This would be my first time to sample Thai food. Meh is how I would descibe the food. So it looks like I won't be booking any vacations to Thailand anytime soon. My wife and I ordered noodles with shrimp, Kung Pao chicken and pork barbeque for take out ($32). The food was bland and flavorless in my opinion.",0
"I have been here 3 times.  The first two times the food was good and everyone was nice.  It's a little dirty and dark in the dining room, but I don't mind an old divey place if the food is good.  Yesterday I went there with a colleague for lunch and they brought us water.  We waited for 15 minutes for the server and then left and went to Pei Wei instead because there were 3 other tables waiting for the server when we got there.  And they weren't that busy.",0
"I admit that this restaurant is in my neighborhood and has been a mainstay for us for several years, with 2-4 visits per month with consist ant quality and yummy-tude. My personal Thai favorite dish is Tom Kah Guy soup and Thai Lahna's is the version I use to measure all other Thai places we try when we are traveling. The menu is expansive and usually the selections are top notch. We will keep going back as long as they keep the doors open. And, BTW, if you get the chance, try the pumpkin custard and Thai tea with cream.",1
"This restaurant is mediocre Chinese type at best... Ordered the green curry and a red curry... The green curry was a lumpy, floating in grease mess.  The red was equally as greasy and neither had coconut milk in them??  I can't believe this place is still in business.  We did call as soon as the containers were opened to ask exactly WTH they were, and they were quick to offer a refund to our card (something tells me they get many similar calls)... Not authentic thai by far.",0
"So... I went to this place off of word of mouth for goo thai food. I took my 2 sisters and a friend. Tea was really good so I thought we were off to a good start.  My sister started off with cabbage raps that were over salted and not good. We all placed an order for different things so that we can get a feel for the restaurant. I ordered a noodle dish.... they brought me a rice dish. I was trying to tell the waiter that the dish was wrong and they were very rude and would not help me at all. I attempted to waive down another waiter and asked for a manager and they told me that he would not come out. After that My 9 months pregnant sister was served her sweet chicken.. (now keep in mind she is a little less patience then normal in this last month so not so easy to please).. gets her food and it was cold and bland and dry. She asked for them to fix it and got push back so then asked if can then order something else. The waitress said yes and then took the order. 15 Min goes by and she asked what was the eta of her food and the waitress said that they manager told her that she sent her food back and that he was not making her anything else....... Crazy right! SHE WAS VERY UPSET, NOT ONLY DID THEY SAY THAT THEY WOULD BUT THEN THEY DIDNT EVEN TELL HER THAT THEY WERE NOT GOING TO BRING HER ANYTHING ELSE.  We asked to speak to a manager and then he came out from the kitchen and yelled at us to get out and leave that he will no longer serve us. \n\nI don't care how good the food is....THIS PLACE HAS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN. I HAVE WORKED FOR RESTURANTS AND HAVE NEVER HAD PEOPLE TREAT THERE CUSTOMERS THIS WAY!!!!!!",0
"Went on Sat night at about 7:30pm, and place was about 30% full..somewhat worrisome for Sat night of Mothers Day weekend.  I ordered red curry with chicken and my wife ordered steamed tofu with vegetables.  They were out of the steamed tofu and so she settled for eggplant and vegetables.\nHad a glass of chard.before dinner--good price, average wine.\n\nFood came fast.  Curry dish had lots of chicken, excellent curry spice but lots of salt.  Only had carrots in it.  Menu had \""""no substitutions\"""" all over it--not very flexible in that area!  Her dish had the eggplant so tough she had to order a knife to cut it.  After the meal, when we complained about the eggplant, the waitress said \""""I'm sorry\"""".  When we asked if she couldn't do anything more about it, she then offered to take 50% of her meal.  The service overall was polite but not attentive.\nTotal bill for two entrees, one glass of wine and no dessert or appetizers was $23.00 and then they took $5.00 for the bad eggplant.\n\nIn summary: all the good reviews we had found about this operation seemed to be \""""old\"""" or maybe the lead chef was not there this night, because we would not go back.  Reasonable prices, ok atmosphere for a strip mall Thai restaurant, some dishes are probably excellent, but overall, not good enough service to make up for an average to poor meal experience.\n\nRob A, May 7th, 2011.",0
"Yay I am here with a happy update! The past few times I have been back, they have NOTICEABLY improved both timeliness and friendliness, which brings them to a solid 4 stars in my book. \n\nKudos, Thai Lana, Kudos.",1
"A great takeout restaurant, it is a sit down restaurant as well but I don't much care for the atmosphere of the restaurant. The food is delicious, I recommend the yellow curry with chicken.",1
"I love this place for their pad-thai; it's SO flavorful and delicious! With the perfect amount of heat too! I find that the chicken is a little dry, so I order it without and stick with all prawns. SO GOOD!\n\nI've only tasted the other dishes from friends plates. I find the curry (I've tired yellow) is a little salty (and lacking in something...) I generally stick with the pad thai, since it's so good. I have had the chicken in coconut broth. It is pretty good, has a lot of lemon grass flavor and, obviously, coconut. Again, I find the chicken is a little dry (you wouldn't think that for a soup, but, it is) presentation is really cool....they serve it in a silver, thai style bowl, with a flaming center (you generally share it with the table, all dipping from the same bowl).\n\nI've never had problems with service, they are very friendly, a little slow, if anything. It is a small restaurtant, a little out-dated, but o.k.",1
"Even after hearing about this place for years, I had still not taken the time to check it out.  Tonight was the night.\n\nWhen my friend and I walked in, the waitress looked at us, then the clock and with a big sigh said, \""""We close at 9:30.\""""  We thought about informing her that it was only 8:45, which meant they were open for nearly another hour but, instead, we just turned around and walked out.\n\nI doubt I will ever return.  What a nasty first impression to give out to people.  Judging from some of the other reviews on in, I'm not the only one underwhelmed with the customer service here.  Can't judge the food.",0
"I got to the restaurant, looking forward to some great Thai food in the area. Lunch hours end at 2:30 (they close before dinner), and I arrived at 2:10. Didn't think it would be a big deal. When I walked in, the lady immediately told me that they close at 2:30 and handed me a menu as if I should order takeout. I asked, \""""Can I eat here?\"""" and she said I could. I sat down, looked at the menu for maybe 1 minute, and she came by and wanted to take my drink and food order at the same time. When I told her that I was still looking, she again reminded me they close at 2:30. I should have gotten up and left figuring I was not going to have a relaxed lunch, but I did not. \n\nThe dish I ordered had a star by it, indicating it was spicy but could be modified to customer's taste. So when I ordered it, I asked if it could be prepared mild, and she said no. Okay then. The food came quickly and it was good, but they made it clear they wanted me gone quickly by giving me the check right away and asking if I wanted a takeout container while I was eating. I must have made them uncomfortable reading the New Times while I was eating. Here's the kicker--after I boxed up my food and was opening my fortune cookie and finishing my drink, some other lady came over (she put a vacuum nearby) and said, \""""I'm sorry, we close, 2:30.\"""" I glared at her and told her I was almost finished. \n\nSomeone needs to tell them that the doors should LOCK at 2:30, but not to expect everyone to scram if they are having a meal. I will never go back.",0
"I used to love this place but I suspect it has changed owners in the past few years.\nwe had a friend in town who fondly remembered a meal he once had there so we decided to try it again.. It was a pretty bad experience with bad service-they were unprepared for a busy Friday night. What a disaster! The food is ok ( too salty) but the presentation, lack of care is evident both in service and overall experience.\nSomeone at Thai Lahna needs to regroup and reorganize. I hope they get their act together because it is a great location and has been good in the past.",0
"I came to this place several years ago, when I swear it was the only Thai restaurant in Phoenix.  I remember I really liked everything.  But this most recent trip after all those years made me realize it has really gone downhill.\n\nMy first and biggest gripe is that they don't even have Thai Basil on the menu.  That should be a staple everywhere and it is my favorite dish.  Maybe it is hard to get fresh basil in the desert?  So instead I had some yellow curry with potatoes and chicken.  It was okay.  Nothing special.  The rest of our meal was just mediocre as well.  \n\nAlso, the Thai iced coffee had cream in it, instead of sweetened condensed milk.  That is a big fail right there!  I am sure that by now there are many many better Thai food restaurants in the Valley.  Go and find them.  Pass this one by - unless you are really hungry and stuck in the strip mall for some reason.",0
"Thai Lahna, some of the best flavors around. From the Tom Kai Gai, to their Prad Prik Khing rice, its just a food orgasm in your mouth. \n\nLike many, i'm always dissapointed in the service. They're shorthanded and they have their wait staff help with kitchen duties like cutting vegetables, etc \n\nI recommend either A. ordering take out or B. Order your food when you get there, to minimize the wait.",1
"When we first sat down, one of our party asked the server if they had sparkling water.  She, unfortunately, spoke very little English.  Rather than getting someone to help her with the question she didn't understand, she shoved the drink menu in his face and walked away.  WOW!\n\nWe made our order, beginning with Chicken Satay.  The response - we are out of chicken satay.  So, we decided to go with beef satay.  A few minutes later, she came back and said they were out of that also.  So, we decided on the egg roll.  We were very upset to see the table next to us receive an order of chicken satay.  What is going on here?\n\nNow, unlike every other decent restaurant on the planet, dishes do not arrive together at this restaurant.  My Phaht Thai (allegedly one of their specialties) arrived first.  I was about to dig in when they came and grabbed it away from me claiming it was for another table.  Then I watched as the dish that was on MY table was given directly to another diner.  No wonder this restaurant has so many Health Department violations.\n\nFinally, all the dishes arrived (one at a time) and we were able to eat.  The Thai Lahna Special Fried Rice (with chicken, beef, pork and shrimp) was the best thing we had - good flavor and tasty.  Not particularly generous with the meats, but for $9.95, we weren't expecting much.  The Kai Phaht Khahnah (Chicken stir-fried with broccoli in a light oyster flavored sauce) was the next best thing - the oyster sauce was really pretty good.  Everything else made us wonder if the chef could even find Thailand on a map.  The Phaht Thai was horrible.  It was basically rubber bands masquerading as noodles and bean sprouts with a couple small pieces of chicken and 2 shrimp.  The Vegetable Curry was unlike any curry I've ever seen.  The \""""sauce\"""" was so thin and runny, it was more like a soup than a sauce.\n\nAll in all, this was a terrible restaurant that I would highly NOT recommend.  The only thing good is the price.  Certainly not the food and DEFINITELY not the service.",0
"I've had one okay experience at Thai Lahna and one pretty bad experience. \n\nThe first trip, my friend and I received our food promptly and it was good. I had the pad kee mow and it was tasty and the serving size was large enough to have a take home box. The service was nothing to write home about but it wasnt awful. \n\nThe second time I came with my husband, the service was deplorable. It took us 20 minutes just to get a glass of water and an acknowledgement of our presence. My husband ordered pad see eew (I'm so sorry I don't know the correct spelling, I'm just going phonetically here) and the waitress told him that they didn't have it. It's a pretty common thai dish so he asked for it by a different name, like drunken noodles, and she said she didn't know it again and only knew \""""the number\"""" - common for restaurants with hard to pronounce dishes. She said she didn't know the names of the dishes, she just wrote down the numbers. She was really short with us and basically belted that if it wasnt on the menu they didn't have it. \n\nShe then asked her colleague to come over to our table to again point out that they don't have the dish, and began speaking over our table to each other in Spanish. \n\nShe then left for 10 minutes when someone from the kitchen staff came out. My husband asked again for the dish he desired and the staff member knew it immediately and put in the order. \n\nI can understand a fresh server and someone who isn't as familiar with the menu, but to be put on the floor with zero training and to be so rude to a customer really blows my mind.",0
"Got the #13 Tom Yum soup, which was salty to almost unedible, with shrimp cooked to within an inch of their life, pretty poor example of this type of soup\n\nThe #54 Pad Thai was done reasonably well, however the menu states chicken and shrimp, there certainly was no shrimp in this dish it was just chicken, - Americanized but still tasty \n\nBased on this trip I would probably not return",0
"I have been eating at Thai Lahna on and off for about 4-5 years now. Not many know but Thai Lahna is the first Thai Restaurant in Phoenix. This is what their chef/cook told me months ago when I was there. I don't know if this is true, but it made sense to me. \n\nWhen I first started enjoying the food here the one thing I did not enjoy was the service. Orders were wrong, and the servers rarely would come to refill drinks. I am happy to say that this has all changed. The servers are on top of their game making sure that all customers are being attended to in a timely manner. \n\nThe Sweet and Sour Tofu was amazing!!!! I felt like I was having a desert and dinner at the same time. It was so good my friend and I ordered a second entree. The serving size for this entree seemed a little small, but on the other hand we get over served portions at most restaurants. \n\nOverall I really enjoyed my meal here and look forward to coming again. Also the Tom Kai Gai or however you spell it is amazing as well!",1
"Love the Phat ti. (Pad Tie)? That's how it sounds. :-P\n\nAmbient - Walls and decar are all pretty much thai inspired.  Red table cloths and golden accents all around.  Dim lighting, coozy, booths and tables.\n\nService - They are for the most part very attentive and friendly.\n\nFood - LOVE LOVE their pad ti or is Phat tai, well how ever it is spelled.  IT is DELICIOUS.  We have tried other places and its just not the same.  This is the place for Pad Tie! :-P",1
"I have tried this place 4 times. The food is not very good. I have lived in Thai Land but don't expect to get the same excellent food here. I love Thai food and Thai people, don't think much of this place, I live close by but go elsewhere. The food is bland, overcooked and pretty Americanized. I have always been pleasant, patient and courteous but never gotten good service. The servers are lazy and sometimes rude and you are going to wait a longtime for every step of the service process. With so many good Thai restaurants in Phoenix there is no reason to eat here.",0
"Two times eating here and two times leaving very satisfied. The pad Thai is perhaps the best I've had in Phoenix. The panang curry was nothing short of addictive. The mango w/sticky rice was a delicious end to the first meal there. \n\nI believe they've been in business 30+ years making them the oldest Thai place still in operation. \n\nThe service has been friendly, the location clean, so I will certainly be back!",1
"We used to love this place and get take-out from there 2+ times a month but something happened over the last 12 months and their philosophy on customer service became non-existant. \n\nMy girlfriend is vegan and we ordered (take out) pad thai without meat/egg. It had chicken, no biggie... We called them up and they told her that it did not have chicken in it and that we would have to take it back to prove they had prepared it wrong. When she brought it back, they hadn't even started cooking the food because they believed that she was lying. We swore we wouldn't go back... \n\nToday we thought we'd give it another go. I ordered chicken pad thai and wanted to replace the shrimp with veggies. After putting the phone down for minutes, I could hear her talking to the manager. They wanted me to get veggie pad thai and add chicken (Another $2). She told me that this is because they pre-prepare their food. \n\nWe've decided to just get thai from Sa-Bai and they will get our 2+ times a month thai fix.",0
"We used to go here a lot and service was always slow, but the other night service was horrible as we waited 5 minutes to be seated and another 10 minutes before leaving as we had not even received water or any interaction with our server... Very disappointed as their food was always good, but going to try something else next time.",0
"Ok, I've ordered takeout from them twice now and it's been a challenge. The staff has no knowledge of the menu without ordering by numbers. The dishes are not spicy and portions are on the small side for the price. When I arrived both times I was not greeted and it was dead in there. I asked for chili oil just anything that would make the dish spicy and neither staff member knew what I was talking about. I will not be coming back just for the fact that they may not know where they are working!",0
"Thai food is pretty easy to do well. Unfortunately thai lahna cuts a lot of corners and serves mediocre food. It's a neat little space with cool decorations but it's nowhere near the best thai you can get in the area \n\nChicken satay was ok, but the peanut sauce was runny and gross. Chicken lahb (I normally see it called \""""larb\"""") didn't have nearly enough citrus and I could feel granules of chili powder on my tongue. Green curry with beef was underwhelming in flavor and lacked any interesting tasty veggies\n\nIf a friend made this meal for me, I'd be like great job, keep working at it! Unfortunately this is a restaurant, so it gets 2 stars",0
Would be 3.5 to 4 stars for solid food but phone was busy for an hour straight.  I decided to go there and place my order. I saw the phone was left off the hook for the last 2.5 hours...phone was ticking on screen. She then told me they were busy with orders and lied (server who was taking order at desk). I guarantee the owner who is very nice doesn't realize why no one called to put in order all night. I called every 2 minutes for an hour and no one even picked up order.,0
"I love thai food and go to various thai restaurants weekly. I went here recently. Waited 10 minutes to be seated. Then waited another ten minutes before leaving. I overheard a \""""to go\"""" customer complain about the wait. She had been there for an hour! Very dated decor is another negative.",0
"Is the food here Thai or Chinese?? Where is the basil, an important ingredient in Thai cuisine, in their dishes?? And the fish sauce, another crucial ingredient that marks Thai flavors?? This could pass for Americanized Chinese food though but I'll pass on this place next time...",0
I have been to many Thai restaurants and I usually always rate a Thai place by their pad thai. I have to say I was not impressed.  First of all when your paying for shrimp pad thai and not inexpensively cone to find they only give you 3 shrimp. There service was good and the decor was very authentic but just was not worth the price you are paying for. Even tho it was ok I will not be returning. There are more places to choose from.,0
"WORST THAI we've ever had. Greasy, gross, packaged mix flavors. And not Thai--it's bad Chinese food pretending to be Thai food.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n1) Mii Krobb (me grob as it's called at other Thai restaurants). This sticky yumminess is supposed to be created in a wok and the sauce cooked *with* the noodles. The crap they gave us was a bunch of short, pre-made crunchy rice noodles with red-dye #40 sweet/sour sauce DRIZZLED on it. Seriously????? Gross. We took one bite and no more. \n\n2) Phaht Thai (pad Thai at other Thai places): so gross we didn't finish it! Very greasy and tasted like the sauce was made from a packaged mix.\n\n3) Sweet n Sour Tofu: the tofu was disgusting--it's fried first, then dipped in batter and fried again. I took one bite and didn't eat any more. Massively greasy blob of gross. Sauce says it's homemade on the menu but it looks nuclear red and tastes packaged.\n\n4) Spicy Thai rice: again--\u00fcber greasy and also not flavorful.\n\nWe will never go back.",0
"I purchased my bed at this location just over 1 year ago. The sales guy seemed nice, we tried a bunch of beds, he wasn't pushing me in any expensive direction, and he guaranteed delivery the same day. I paid $800 for a double bed and box spring. \n\nOne year later and I'm ordering a new bed from someplace else. This is the worst mattress I've ever slept on. I'm not a particularly picky sleeper - even my college dorm mattress was fine. I am sensitive to drooping mattresses and this one felt sunken almost one month out of the gate and after one year I can't take it anymore.  Take a look at any mattress warranty and you'll see that up to 2 INCHES of drooping is considered normal and does not warrant replacement or compensation. Rad. \n\nMattress purchasing is so insanely subjective that I wouldn't dissuade you from shopping at Bedmart; I'm sure someone else could find a bed they love and use for years there.  My own experience is that I wasted $800 with no recourse.",0
"Please make 0 stars an option Yelp!  Avoid BOB and STEVE at the Thomas/44th St. location at all costs! Got suckered into a Serta Perfect Sleeper here, and within a MONTH the nearly $1500.00 bed was sagging!  We didn't want to deal with it and are moving and called Bedmart about the warranty weeks ago.  They looked up our file, and said that an inspector would \""""be in touch\"""" to set up an appointment to inspect the bed.  I waited a week and called back but they said not to worry.  I called a week later, and they said they would \""""look into it.\""""  Called again and they said they'd look into it again, but go no return call.  Finally, I called again today, for the 4th time, and STEVE told me there was no way it would happen until next year (after we move).  \n\nThat's annoying, and bad service, sure, but the reason I'm writing this is that they were patronizing, rude, and just plain insulting.  When I said I was dissatisfied at having to wait a month, after we move, just for the initial appointment, STEVE spoke to me like he was doing me a favor to look into why we had not been contacted!  In fact, he actually said this!  He was vague about the whole thing and when I asked a question about it, he actually said he could fax my request to the \""""factory today\"""" or \""""THROW IT IN THE TRASH!\""""  \n\nBTW, the \""""manager\"""" Bob said the factory is actually closed, so faxing it was not a favor at all!  Either way, are they really doing me a favor to follow up on the bad service for the crappy product they sell?  No!  \n\nI called back and asked to speak to the store manager, who answered the phone and identified himself as BOB.  Without even giving me a chance to say hello, he gruffly said he had heard the whole conversation and was not going to allow abuse.  I explained that I was the abused one, and that unless I had been on speaker phone, he had only heard one side of the conversation.  He did not like facts, and was even more rude after I pointed this out.  Needless to say, he clearly did not care about customer service, talked over me and cut me off, and spoke to me like he was Donald Trump and I was his peon contestant.  He proceeded to tell me that there would be no inspection anytime soon, since the Serta factory was closed until the New Year. \n\nBut he offered a hollow favor...if I wanted, he would call me Monday, Xmas Eve.  Umm, hello, but you just told me the factory who sets up the inspection appointments, is closed for 10 days...so what new information would you have in 2 days?  BOB did not want to be bothered with facts, and just wanted to shove it to me, whether it made sense or not, so he kept repeating and belaboring this.  \n\n\""""When does the factory open, I asked?\""""  But BOB, who either made up the whole thing about the closure, or knew only half the facts, or just wanted to keep shoving it to me, wouldn't tell me.  \""""When do you want me to call you back, since you want everything on your schedule,\"""" he asked.  \""""How about right when the factory re-opens.\""""  \""""How about we just have them call you to set up the appointment,\"""" he said.  Um, but \""""I already did that weeks ago, and they didn't set it up,\"""" I pointed out.  (That's why I called 4 times.)  \""""Whenever the factory opens, the next day would be fine,\"""" I said.  Then BOB decided, even though I told him this would not work, he would not follow up on why they hadn't called and just start over.  In other words, throw the follow-up request in the trash!  No, I said, I don't want that.  \""""That's what I'm doing,\"""" and then hung up on me\n\nWe went to BedMart looking for a latex mattress that was firm.  But Bed Mart on 44th/Thomas convinced us that this spring bed would be great and would not sag.  They lied.  Then we call about the warranty because the bed is crap and they know it, we don't hear from them repeatedly.  Someone else at the 44th/Thomas location was supposed to follow up with me two days ago but never did (on my 3rd call).  Clearly, they want to get a bed sold, period.  If you have a problem, which eventually you will, they will tell you it is someone else fault, not return calls, patronizingly tell you that they are doing you a favor to follow up on your lack of service, and basically treat you like you are crap because you have a problem with the bed.  To top it all off, they will hang up on you and be rude.  Stay away from this location, from BedMart generally, and from Bob and Steve!",0

Bedmart is a sleazy company.   Dishonest...   Pricing is horrible.

Keep 1 hand on your money if you deal with this sleazy company.,0
"I agree with the 0 star rating. Ordered box spring for Cal King and received Regular king box spring instead.  It's their mistake but would not admit and charging another delivery fee to come pick them up. It is insane! Nothing is written as return policy.

Great service from Sherry! She helped me out a lot with finding the right matress for my daughters new loft bed and I got a great deal!!!,1
"I rent from here often and have always had a good experience. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The service is quick, easy and the equipment and party rentals are reasonably priced.",1
"I planned my reception myself and used A-Z for a big part of my site- ranging from the chairs to the generator to glasses and tables. The staff there, Becky Rodgers, in particular, was a joy to work with- very responsive and helpful (which was great as my order changed a lot of times). She made sure my order was right and worked closely with me to ensure everything was perfect. They delivered and picked up everything exactly as promised and were very professional and fast. They also have tons to choose from and will help you make the best choice for your money. Pricing was competitive too. Highly recommend!",1
"I entered the store and was not acknowledged. The party/wedding rental area was abandoned, save for a price list and a variety of wedding vendor business cards on a table. Walked around, nobody came in. Not really my job as the customer to go LOOKING for a warm body. Found the prices on the list to be higher, item for item, than any other rental company in the valley. This place was a total waste of my limited time.",0
"I just wanted to add that in addition to party and catering equipment, they also rent heaps of tools and equipment. Think hedge trimmers, lawn aerators, cement mixers - stuff you might need for a once a year or special project, and so, don't want to invest in the equipment.\n\nIn our case, we needed a chainsaw to take down some dead stuff from last winter's freeze, an unwelcome sapling, a dead tree, branches encroaching the roof, and to tame some monstrous oleanders.\n\nI was just about to head to the tool rental department at that big box home improvement store, when a friend mentioned A to Z. I gave them a call, and their prices were competitive. Plus it had that feel good factor of being a local biz.\n\nThe process was pretty easy. We got a thorough tutorial on chainsaw operation and safety, and were on our way to some serious arboreal carnage.\n\nPro tip: rent on Friday after 4pm. You can return it Monday morning, and only be charged for one day (Saturday), since they are closed on Sunday.",1
"Do NOT expect timely service....or really any service at all.  Thankfully, due to them not getting me a quote because \""""they are busy\"""", I found Andrews Party Rentals and went with them for an event.  Also, as noted in other reviews, keep in mind that they will not actually bring the items to the location, but actually only dump them off curbside.  Maybe it's just me, but I'm not keen on dragging tables, linens, heaters, ,etc off of the curb and into the actual location of the event.  I gave them 1 star only because you have to in order to post a review.",0

Perfect on the drop off of rented tables and chairs but when it came to pick up on the Monday morning absolutely useless. My wife and I took a day off work with the plan that we would go out for the day once these people had picked up but when I hadn't heard from them by 11.40 I decided to call. The response was we are running behind schedule because Monday's are always busy but we should be there in another couple of hours so there goes our vacation day wasted. I would not recommend this company.,0
"After being on hold for 20 minutes and being transferred to several people, someone finally offered to help me. I needed to rent tables, chairs, and more for a birthday party. Long story short- they have horrible customer service and I was told there is no guarantee on time of delivery. They were unable to work with me and could not offer a solution. If you are looking for a party rental company- call Michael at rentaffordable.com in Tempe. A-z is awful.",0
I really needed a cigarette at the Vig the other night and they were closed at 11:30 PM on a Saturday night. I'm deducting a star and holding it hostage until the next time I need something and Empire is actually open for me to get it.,0
"We used Dr Lieb for several years until recently when we felt we had to find another vet.  We had Dr Lieb put our Westie, Emma, to sleep and the experience was not a good one.  Our expectations were driven by what we had read online about how most vets will give a sedative and then time to spend saying goodbye.  When you are ready they will administer the med which puts them to sleep permanently.  \n\nDr. Lieb said that by the time Emma got a sedative she could have her done by then.  So while Emma was still aware and able to feel everything the vet shaved her leg and rooted around for a vein.  Emma, could feel all this and was not happy and fought all three of us.  This went on so long that I got completely nauseated and upset and had to leave the room.  My husband said the vet eventually gave her something to calm her down since she couldn't get a vein with her squirming.\n\nEmma had 15 good years and I wanted her passing to be as good an experience as it could be.  She did not get that.",0
"I am very sad to be writing such a poor review for Desert View Animal Hospital. I have been taking my dog there for almost 4 years and the previous Vet was wonderful. Sadly she retired. I have been to see Dr Derksen 4 times now and I am not impressed. \n\nThe first few times I noticed how prone she was to push medication on the problems with my dog. I, also, noticed a significant increase in the price of the medications. I have no problem spending as much money as needed to help my dog. However, I am a nurse and I know some of the choices of medications could have been different, saved me money and still treated my dog. I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt, because I really like Denise at the front desk. She is the only staff member I recognize now. All the vet techs I knew and really liked no longer work there. The other good thing about this office is they always schedule me in a timely manner. I got in right away today. I enjoy the convenience factor, but now I am wondering if that is because they do not have a lot of clients!!  \n\nThe last visit was my last straw. When I got to the office the vet tech did not even say hello to me. She was very nice to Finn, but did not make eye contact with me once. \n\nWhen Dr Derksen came to assess Finn she did a focused assessment. Once she was done she prescribed an antibiotic and was literally trying to walk out of the room when I was still asking questions. She then said try this antibiotic and if that does not work we will test him for valley fever. My dog is very important to me and telling me he may have valley fever, but we will wait and see is completely unacceptable to me. The prescription she gave me was doxycycline. I am a nurse and I know this medication is extremely, extremely  expensive. When I went to fill it at Walgreens they told me it was going to be 500.00. I call the office back during regular business hours to speak with Dr Derksen, but she had left for the day. I was then told by the front desk about a pharmacy that is significantly cheaper. Why would they not provide that information when I was at the office? \n\nI then spoke with a family member who is a vet tech in another state and she said Amoxicillin will treat Finn the exact same and it is 8 dollars. My family member also said that all the Vets she works with knows that doxycycline is very expensive right now and Dr Derksen should have known that. Whether she knew about the cost difference and did not care or she is incompetent, I do not care. I will not be going back to see her again.",0
Dr. Lieb performed surgery on our guinea pig and did an excellent job.  The surgery was flawless and our guinea is healthy and happy now.  The price was excellent for her work including general anesthesia.,1
I had an amazing experience with the new veterinarian. Her name is  Pamela Boyd.She is amazing.She took care of my dog like Doctor Lieb.I recommend this veterinary to everybody who wants a vet who cares about the animals,0
5 STARS..I cannot switch the stars in my precious review but I give them 5 stars:) The staff is amazing and very loving:),1
"It pains me to write this review. I'm hurting. But, I must yelp the truth. \n\nLet's start with the positive because I want more than anything to feel good about Kachina Dry Cleaners. \n\nThe location is good (40th st and Indian School) and I love the kitsch of their name and the sign. It's so old Arizona that I wanted so much to love them.\n\nThe woman who (I think) owns the joint is SO SWEET. I just love her. She's always happy and you leave thinking that your clothes will be in the tenderest of care. I also have made up this story that she and her husband moved out here in 1950 and opened up this dry cleaners on the outskirts of Phoenix and her husband has passed away, but she carries on the business. (Understand that I've made all of that up in my head.)\n\nThere are two OTHER women there though that are the most unpleasant creatures I've ever come into contact with. \n\nI've tried. Seriously. I've often pulled up, sat in the car and screwed up every bit of nice I had in my body to try and get them (especially one) to smile back. But, no. I get a downright grimace, no eye contact and barely an utterance. Oh, I've tried!!!! \n\nPlus, they always need at least three days. \n\nThen, they lost my clothes once. Someone ELSE had picked up my clothes. \n\nBut, I kept going back because I just love the owner. \n\nSo, I'm sorry, Kachina Dry Cleaners lady. I love you. And I want to support you. \n\nBut, I can't.",0
"I was referred to Kachina Dry Cleaners by the gang at Park Avenue DC (my regular dry cleaners) on Indian School Rd. \n\nWhat a sad experience! The lady at the counter was so rude that after I dropped off my \""""special\"""" items a pair of newly purchased thermal drapery panels - I almost went back in and asked for them back. In hindsight, I should have followed my instincts!\n\nSince the items had to be \""""sent out\"""" and were over two weeks in the processing - I called three days past the promised date to be screamed at by the lady who answered the telephone. She yelled, \""""did anyone call you?\"""" When I replied \""""no\"""" but the ETA was three days ago ...she slams  down the telephone, returning 5 minutes later - saying, \""""yeah they're here\"""" and hangs up!\n\nMy husband picked the drape up the next day - the cost was twice what was quoted...the items were not pressed, still having the original wrinkles from the packaging AND they have glue-like spots all over them. These drapes were brand new and in perfect conditions sans the packaging wrinkles...\n\nThe customer service staff is terrible - and the dry cleaning services are worse. Do not use this dry cleaner for anything that you don't mind throwing away!",0
"After reading all the reviews for this clinic I really wanted to take my kitty there, but I also called \""""Alta Vista\"""" and \"""" Dog/Cat/Bird Hospital\"""" and was pleasantly surprised to find out that apart from being rated the best \""""Blue Cross\"""" had the most reasonable prices. I called on Monday and they were booked but after I told them what was going on with my kitty and that we needed to see the doctor as soon as possible, they said they might be able to \""""squeeze\"""" us in some time that day and that it would cost extra $20. I also requested Dr. Ryan if it was possible at all. So, our appointment was scheduled for 4 p.m. but since I don't drive I had to ask one of my friends to take me there, and one of them could do it but she could do it at 2 p.m. which means I would have to wait there.. It worked out well: somebody cancelled their appointment and they were able to take us in at 3 p.m. and we didn't have to pay extra. To cut a long story short, I completely agree with all the previous reviews for this clinic. Dr. Ryan is the best doctor one can wish for! Unfortunately she wasn't able to save my kitty because it turned out she had cancer and was suffering, so I had to let her go, but Dr. Ryan was there to support my decision... I just told her I didn't want my little girl to suffer, and if she couldn't have good quality life anymore it was time to let her go. She didn't try to run more tests than we needed, I could feel it wasn't about money but about my pet. She was very gentle and considerate with her. I absolutley trust Dr. Ryan and would HIGHLY recommend her and the clinic to anyone. Brandie - the girl on the reception, was also really nice and helpful in trying to get that appointment for us the same day. I don't have anything negative to say about this place and if I have another pet I will definitely be going there for our checkups and etc. They are open Mon.-Fr.: 7a.m.-6p.m., Saturday:8 a.m. - 12 p.m. Office visit and exam - $42; chest x-ray (2 views) - $125",1
"I live in Gilbert and drive to Scottsdale for Dr. Dutton, that says a lot. She understands people who have financial situations and does not push unnecessary treatments and provides other options. \n\nOne quick story to show why I love her so much: My female rottie came down with a rare blood disorder. When I brought her in during the day because of her 1st symptoms all the needed tests were run and we had to wait for the results. I brought my dog home and later that night her nose started bleeding. Around 7pm I called their office, totally expecting them to be gone for the night and for me to be transferred to the ER Clinic, but one of the other vets answered. I explained I had seen Dr. Dutton earlier that day and what was going on. She told me she would try to get ahold of Dr. Dutton, 10 minutes later Dr. Dutton called me from her home. She told me to bring my dog and she would meet me at her office. I have never heard of a vet willing to come back into the office, or even calling you from their home! I highly recommend her and know several friends who also use her! \n\nI have also taken my dogs in and they were seen by the other vets on staff when Dr. Dutton wasn't available, they have all been great.",1
"So disappointed. All the reviews here are great, and this is so close to my home that I was excited to bring my kitten in to set up a health relationship with these veterinarians. But in the past two weeks my cat has had two different non-emergency but still urgent care situations come up and BCVC totally dropped the ball.  Please note that the 2 star score is because the doctors themselves are pretty nice. If you can get to them.\n\n Last week it was diarrhea, which could mean a myriad of larger problems. I called after business hours and left a message for the on call vet, Dr. Dutton on the 'non-emergency' line. I just wanted to find out if there were symptoms to be looking for. The Dr. never returned my call. The next morning and a totally unconcerned receptionist told me there were no same day appointments, 1 appointment the next day in mid-afternoon (when I'm at work) and a few the 2nd day in the morning.\nThe 2nd day appt was made and I went in to see Dr. Brandt who was fairly prompt and examed Josie, gave her a 72 hour vitamin med to help her bowels and sent us off. \n\nLast night I got home to a cat with one eye almost completely shut and weeping, with green mucus, a very red third eyelid. Scary. I knew I had to wait until 7AM to call, because BCVC doesn't take messages, and clearly the on call vets don't give a shit, so I got up this morning and just brought her in at 7, hoping they could spare a minute to look at my cat's freaky eye problem. There was no one else in the waiting room (of course) when I arrived, yet the receptionist told me there were no appointments available until 4PM (again when I'm working) and had no interest in letting me see someone now. I asked if they had affiliate clinic recommendations, or a nearby rec at least, and she said no. She did offer to let me leave my cat ALL day in a cage at the clinic so she would be there for the 4PM appointment, but well, my cat can't explain her symptoms to the doctor now can she?\n\nFinally I squeezed the name of an emergency clinic on 40th and Cactus out of her and took off for there. \n\nLook I'm sorry my cat can't get sick on your schedule Blue Cross Veterinary Clinic, but maybe for your next customer (since I won't be returning) you could offer a bit of compassion for an animal in distress.",0
"I have decided that I need to be writing more reviews since I base so many of my experiences on what other Yelpers have to say yet I have never sat down to write a review myself. This Vet is going to change that.\n\nI could easily go on and on about how amazing this place is, but it would inevitably repeat what many others have said so I'll try to make it short...ish.\n\nAfter being TERRIBLY dissatisfied with The Scottsdale Veterinary Clinic I seeked the guidance of Yelpers to help me find a new Vet for my dog Slapshot who was having a mixture of issues with arthritis and stomach problems. After reading so many good reviews of BCVC and comparing them to various great reviews for other places, my gut instinct (and the feeling that BCVC treats 1st time visitors with love and care; many other places have good reviews from folks going there for 20 years. That doesn't help me determine how they are with 1st time visitors) led me to give them a try. BOY am I glad I did!! I called one morning and they were able to get me in that afternoon with Dr. Ryan. She is a GODSEND when compared to the many vets I have visited in the past. She is kind, honest, INCREDIBLY caring, and she understands folks being in financial distress. I dont make much money, so when it's time to go to the vet, I get that queezy, I'm-about-to-spend-$400 feeling in my stomach. Not anymore. After thoroughly checking out Slap's symptoms and actually LISTENING to what I had to say, Dr. Ryan printed out a quote and went through each and every option with me. We decided what was best to do now and what could wait. The quote was for over $400 and I left, HAPPILY spending $179 (X-Rays & Exam), despite the potential that Slapshot may have a life-threatening tumor. She was so thorough and caring that she wanted me to give her a call the next week to bring Slap by so she could feel the tumor and see if it was growing or shrinking, free of cost and appointment. All I had to do was call to make sure she was there and I could stop by.\n\nTurns out, Slap was having some issues with the aspirin we started giving him for his arthritis and after 2 weeks, he was acting kinda strange. We called and talked to Dr. Ryan and she wanted to set up a formal appointment to make sure she had the time to do a thorough exam. After an in-depth exam, we have noticed a decrease in the tumor size and believe the intestinal problems were due to the aspirin. She prescribed 2 pills to help clear out his GI Tract as well as Tramadal for his arthritis as it will not have the harmful side effects of aspirin. (Despite prescribing 3 medications, she is very fond of providing over-the-counter and \""""natural\"""" forms of relief. Foods you can feed, etc. in hopes of avoiding unnecessary medications, so those who feel like they are always bombarded by \"""" your dog NEEDS to take THESE pills\"""" will feel great comfort with Dr. Ryan)\n\nWhen we were paying at the counter (which, I forgot to mentioned is staffed with awesome, caring, genuine people who you cant help but smile around and feel like even THEY care passionately about your animal) we were given the total of $42 for the 3 different pills and told that the visit fee had been waved by Dr. Ryan bc she wanted us to come in formally vs just stopping by for a quick check. How can you not LOVE THAT!?!?\n\nOk, I lied, this isn't a short review, but I just had to tell my story and this is only the surface of it. Long story short. I have NEVER been so happy with ANY Dr experience in my life. And quite honestly, if I go there and face $400 of work to make Slap better, I wont question her judgement one bit bc I KNOW she only has OUR (myself, Slapshot, and MY wallet) BEST interest at heart. She knows how much money things are and if she tells me that I NEED to pay for it, I will. I have yet to walk out that door with ANY REGRET.\n\nI can't speak for any of the other Dr's (although everyone who comes in for care seems to leave the same way I do), but trust me when I say that Dr. Ryan is AWESOME and if you are looking to find a new vet, you should ABSOLUTELY give her a shot!! And the place is clean and bright and the staff is AWESOME and they offer treats and kisses (for the dogs) as you pay your not-as-high-as-every-other-vet-bill. Not sure of the general exam cost but I want to say it is $45 compared to the +/- $65 that I was charged at Scottsdale Vet Clinic (and a few others that I had called in the past). That alone is worth giving them a visit. Dr. Ryan and staff will do the rest of the convincing themselves!!\n\n10 STARS and 4 PAWS UP!!!  Thank You Dr. Ryan & Blue Cross Staff, I have my vet for life!! \n\n- Dustin F. and Slapshot...F.",1
"Our poor dog, Duke, started forming a huge lump on his side in February. We started by taking him to Banfield- don't go there! The vet there told us that his condition was a \""""medical mystery\"""". Great, thanks. We took him to a different Banfield clinic, which didn't give us any better answers.\n\nFinally, I decided to look on Yelp for reviews of vets and find the best one. I read Dustin F's review of Dr. Ryan and decided to try her. That turned out to be a great decision. Dr. Ryan was able to quickly diagnose him (bone cancer :-( ...) and give us some medicine to take away his pain. She also consulted with other vets and a cancer specialist, to be sure she was correct.\n\nOur dog lived much longer than he was predicted to. He had to be put to sleep at the end of July. Dr. Ryan was always there for us, though. We called her every day the last week of his life. She always worked to fit us in to her busy schedule (she is popular!) and made sure we understood everything about Duke's condition. The last night he was with us, we paged Dr. Ryan and she called us back within an hour on her day off! She truly is an excellent vet and cares so much about the animals she treats.",1
"I really really wanted to love this place.  It comes highly recommended by so many people here on yelp plus it is located in a great spot.   I liked Dr Ryan right away on our first visit.  I was hesitant about her because she is so young but she won me over by the end of our visit.  I decided the 30 minute wait must have been just an emergency issue and chalked it off.  \n\nToday was my second visit when I brought our other dog in for his shots.\nI had requested Dr Ryan because she had been so good the first time.  When I had to change our appointment a week out I decided to wait a few days longer just so we could get her.  Well, again I was tapping my toes in the exam room.  This time for almost an hour.  I finally told them I had to leave and the staff offered me Dr Dutton who came in right away and gave  the shots.  \n\nMost places, would give you a break on the visit fee or write it off after making you wait almost an hour.  Not them.  Full price.  The fact that people work hard to get to their appointments on time seems to escape some establishments.  Blue Cross is apparently one of them.  Only one person stuck their head in to say she was running late.  Other than that I could have been running a prostitution ring out of that room and no one would have noticed.\n\nSorry Blue Cross...burn me once shame on you...burn me twice and shame on me.  I won't be returning.  You have nice vets but there are lots of good vets in the valley that will actually value my time and business.",0
"Dr. Bennett is the best vet that I have found anywhere.  My dogs are my children and last Fall my 13 year old pug was diagnosed with terminal cancer.  Dr.  Bennett was kind and compassionate, yet honest with the prognosis and quality of life ahead.  After going to a cancer specialist that she recommended I made the difficult decision to let my little man go with as little pain and as much dignity as possible.  3 months later I adopted another male pug, so that my female pug would have another companion.  Dr. Bennett has been fabulous with both.  She will personally call me to answer any questions/concerns I may have and my pugs adore her.  Anyone looking for a vet who will love and care for their four legged children should schedule an appt with Dr. Bennett.  BTW, she has 2 pugs of her own, so pug owners looking for someone who understands the unique issues with pugs, here she is!",1
"I've had cats and dogs treated here and have always found the staff to be caring and professional.  Dr. Ryan, in particular, is a kind, warm person whose love for animals is obvious.  I would recommend her to anyone.\n\nThe only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is that, on one occasion I watched the front desk receptionist make a woman feel guilty because she opted against a recommended treatment due to the cost.  I'm sure the pet owner didn't feel great about the fact she couldn't afford the care - there was no need to make her feel worse.  I've heard this is done at many vets, sadly.",1
"We have been using Blue Cross since we moved to the Valley nearly 15 years ago.  We had always thought they were great.... until recently.  We had a cat who had been their patient since we moved here.  We had been in several times with him over the preceding month or so because he was old and showing his age.  The day I called them and really needed them, though, I asked if they could see him that day because our guy had stopped moving around very much, and stopped eating and drinking.  I told them this over the phone, only to be told they could 'fit me in' next Thursday (more than a week after I was calling).  I'd been bumped and forced to wait for myriad emergencies of others; I figured this was the time we would be the emergency.\n\nI understand that the vets have lives.  But I seriously expected someplace I'd been going to (and spent lots of money with over the years) to be a LOT more accommodating when a pet is in need of end of life services, especially one who has been a patient for so long.  \n\nThe doctors have always been great.  Unfortunately, the quality of the staff has been going downhill in recent years.  This latest experience has caused us to finally decide to find another vet.",0
"I would choose this clinic for my own medical needs if I could, but my health plan does not currently allow me to see a vet.\n\nDr. Ryan is the  most professional and caring veterinarian in the business!\n\nI would highly recommend Blue Cross Veterinary Clinic!!",1
"To update my major disappointment in the staff.. so about three or so months after our kitty passed, we got a reminder post card for him that it was time for shots. I called and explained that he had died. Now I've just gotten ANOTHER  reminder card, 5 or 6 months later.  Thank you, pathetic staff, for not  having either the brains or the common sense to ensure I don't get these little cards to remind me about losing my pet.  I would give them a zero if I could.",0
"I just had air duct cleaning for my home and they did a great job.  They explained everything before and after.  They were done in the time that they alloted.  They also cleaned 2 chiminies.  They did so good that I had them come 3 days later and do air duct cleaning at my commercial building.  The a/c feels so much better and the building cools down faster.  They were a little bit more expensive in their quote than other companies, however the other companies charge extra for every little thing and Top Hatter just charges a flat fee.",1
"I struck gold...twice!\n\nAre you one of those people who has a fear of the dentist's chair? Well, this is the place for you!\n\nI'm originally from out of state and refused to see a local dentist, opting to wait for visits \""""back home\"""" where I could be seen by my favorite dentist to whom I've been very loyal. He was very skilled and we had a great rapport.\n\nThe day finally came when I couldn't wait for that trip back home due to the lifetime supply of plaque in my teeth. A friend recommended Dr. Choules' office because  of the reputation for getting patients out of the chair in time to get to work early in the morning. I had no idea what I'd also find was skilled, friendly, personable service to rival what I left behind back home.\n\nEveryone --- from the front office to the hygienists to the dentists --- have provided professional, sensitive service with a smile. Melissa, in particular, has been a joy to have as my hygienist. We never seem to lack for things to chat about --- which is a challenge when you're having your teeth cleaned! You'll never feel nervous or uncomfortable in her care. She's the most thoughtful, gentle and considerate hygienist anyone could ask for. I hope someone's reading this and giving her a big, fat raise!\n\nSo, if you're shopping around for dental care, do yourself a favor and make an appointment here. You won't be disappointed. Oh, and the $50 take home bleaching kit offer with a Yelp check in can't be beat! :D",1
"They had good shredded beef tacos and great enchilada sauce.  Much like Jessica, my family, and others who frequent here, have been going forever.  It's always been there and we thought it always would.  We'll miss it but I have a feeling they'll pop up again somewhere, hopefully in AZ too.",1
"Please remove that closed sign you have written across my old review.  Don Jose's is back in business!  I know.... miracles happen.  After 41 years as one of the best and most authentic Mexican food restaurants in Phoenix Don Joes's closed for a short period of time.  But alas, we can all stop the sniveling.  Don Jose's has reopened after a good deal of remodeling.  The best news is everything else is the same.  All of the great, reasonable and made to order food is one waitress from you getting exactly what we loved all those years of weekly dinner at this family owned restaurant.   Don Jose himself will be right there to greet you.  Same food, same great customer service.  What a great way to start the New Year",1
"There are not many places where you can get good food at very reasonable prices.  This is comfort Mexican done well, clearly the same way forever here.  What seems to have stayed the same over the years are the prices.  $3 for a bean burrito, $5 for a chimi.  Re-opening look the same with a new a clean kitchen.  Also, free refills on drinks and chips!  That's a good change.  Now that Don Jose is back, so will I.",1
"My 2nd experience with this restaurant yesterday was NOT positive! A few weeks ago we heard that Don Jose's had reopened so my daughter & I went running over to try it out. The salsa was just as good as it was before but the cheese enchiladas were disappointing. The original Don Jose's cheese enchiladas were the BEST in the Valley. When I ordered a Togo for my husband I was told that they weren't doing \""""To Go's\"""" yet and I would have to put it in the Styrofoam Togo box MYSELF. Yikes! The owner maybe didn't think that there was a liability to his customers by doing that themselves as the plates were steaming hot and I could have burned myself! I scooped the food from the STEAMING plate being very careful not to burn myself. BAD IDEA! \n\nAnd then there was yesterday. We attempted to go again with some friends of the family. We all \""""grew up\"""" with Don Jose (including my Mom who ate there once a week when she worked at Anita's back in the day) and thought this would be a great restaurant to meet at. My sister, daughter & I were 45 minutes early to the restaurant . To our SHOCK the owner would not allow us to be seated because our \""""party\"""" was not all there. There would be 7 of us and he would not hear of it! Hum...there were two big tables sitting there empty. I told the owner that were were tired (just having finished the Willo Home Tour in downtown Phoenix and saving our appetite for Don Jose's) and would be ordering our drinks and a cheese crisp to hold us over until the rest of the girls came. Nope...would not let us be seated and were told \""""that we had to think of him!\"""" \n\nWe then went outside and called the rest of our party and told them that the NEW OWNER would not let us sit down 45 minutes early so we would be going to \""""Manuel's\"""" on 28th Street & Indian School to meet. There we WERE SEATED, spent $85 for the 7 of us PLUS $20 for additional takeout. Sorry NEW OWNER...you missed out on our patronage yesterday and forever! That negative voice and attitude better change because negative publicity travels quickly and in these challenging economic times that is financial suicide... no matter how you try to imatate something that can NOT be reinvented! \n\nTake it from a \""""wise Latina\"""" your customers ALWAYS come first!",0
"It's back, baby. And unlike most sequels, this one's as good as the original. In fact, the new Don Jose is so perfectly recreated that it's like they never left. The new owners are incredibly nice, and most importantly, they loved Don Jose as much as we did, and took great pains to get it right--including partnering with the original owner and family to make sure everything lived up to the name. I've eaten there twice since the reopen and it was like coming home again. I gained five pounds in a week, sure, but that's a problem for another day. \n\nSure, foodie hipsters might not like the place--oh, they didn't redecorate! Waah, they didn't have huitlacoche or cochinita! Insufficiently complex notes in the salsa! Not enough bacon and bacon-related accessories! Egads, cold beef sandwiches!--Boo frickin' hoo. If you care about that stuff, this is likely not the kind of place you'll dig. I totally get that. I feel the same way when I go to a Mexican place that serves squid. Here's the purely objective truth: It's a little bit of a dive but that's just how we like it. It isn't \""""foodie\"""", it's actual food. It's not trying to be anything it's not. No new frontiers or exotic taste adventures here. Just simple, tasty comfort food--classic Arizona Sonoran, with enough vintage American diner-style items to keep the grandparents happy--at a low price, in a warm, clean, classic, friendly old-school environment. If you dig that, you'll love it. If you need more, you'll find it elsewhere. Here the salsa's still tangy, the chips are just right, the beans--delicious. Tacos, burritos, enchiladas, combos, the works--just as it was. All is right with the universe.",1
"Ok, I have to try to take this star rating of this place down a little. For the sake of those that pick a place based on the ratings, I think I owe it to them. \n\nI have lived by this place for years and always wondered why they hadn't torn it down because it was empty, and then one night the place was packed. I was very intrigued. And then when my husband described his receptionist declaring the reopening like it was a state holiday (with tears in her eyes) I thought \""""I gotta get me some of that!\"""" \n\nWe decided to go on an off hour on a Saturday and there was still a 45 minute wait. I liked the old inside, the no need to upgrade attitude was just my style. All of the anxiously waiting people and being right near the kitchen while waiting...I was screaming on the inside with excitement for the sure pleasure my taste buds were about to be hit with....and then we were seated. \n\nFirst, no alcohol. OK, this is a newly reopened place and may not have their license yet (darn I wanted a margarita!), oh well diet coke it is. They bring out a 6 oz cup of drink, a little syrup container of salsa (cute!) and a bowl of chips. I finished the drink in two sips, the salsa had no flavor, and I avoided the chips after the drink because I think the server was a blackbelt in avoiding interaction once the order was placed. \n\nThe food came (and finally a refill, which I should have asked for no ice because the ignoring annoyed me the most) and we began to chow down. My husband got the chili relleno and I got the cheese enchiladas. My first bite I thought \""""hmmm this reminds me of that frozen crap my mom used to try to pass off on me\"""" and I looked across the table to see my husband eyeing my food and his food barely touched. Now, my husband is an ex football player with a huge appetite that used to eat oysters out of a can in college, so that tells you something about his meal. Mine was edible and we shared with an overwhelming violated feeling . \n\nSurprisingly the server was very quick with the bill. I tried to talk my husband into not tipping but he is a gentleman. When I got home I began listing friends that I trusted their opinions to go and tell me that we are absolutely crazy (one of which likes Spam) and should give it another shot. The overall rating...bland, cheap and the salsa scared one of them (she described it like ketchup). \n\nBottom line, don't be fooled like me. The place is no good and should have stayed closed (and I really wanted to like it!).",0
"Greasy, flavorless and unappealing. I will not go back here and recommend that you too find an alternate lunch stop.",0
"First, let it be known that this is another Phoenix establishment that I have been eating at for all of my life, with the exception for the past few years while it was (sadly) closed.\n\nI really, really, really like Don Jose.  It's simple, no fuss and very affordable. And it's TASTY!  The staff has always been friendly in that \""""neighborhood restaurant\"""" kind of way.  They hand you menus on the way in and tell you to sit where you like.  The glasses are cheap and brown and plastic, but thanks to the efficient bus staff, never empty.  The salsa (ahem, hot sauce), and chips are simple but yet it's impossible to stop shoveling them in, meanwhile insisiting that \""""I'm going to stop with this one, so I have room for my dinner.\""""  And then, there's the quesdadilla - flat, thin, crispy, cheesey and delicious!  Is this the BEST mexican restaurant in all of Phoenix?  Maybe not...but what they do, they do very well!  So glad to have them back!",1
"Pretty ghetto. Cash only and Mexican food for gringos, ie not good. They charge you for more chips.",0
Still love this place!__,1
"Tried this spot on a recommendation from a friend.  His words \""""dumpy building, but great food\"""".  Oh he was right about the building!  But the food was horrible.  Let me define horrible in my terms- wouldn't feed it to a dog.  The beef taco was so dry even drenching it with their mediocre salsa didn't help.  Save your money, T Bell is an upgrade compared to this joint.",0
"In Short GREAT FOOD, GREAT PRICE!  Wish it were on the west side. But we still seem to make it over.",1
"All time favorite restaurant! Good prices, good food, fast service!!",1
The owner was so rude I walked out! And they only accept cash and the only reason I gave them a star is because the review made me! I mean this guy was ridiculous! I never had anyone greet me at the door like that!!,0
"This was just about the best Mexican food I have found here in Phoenix. Simple menu with their specialty being chimichanga's. They use a seasoned tortilla that is red and quiet delicious. It ad's the finishing touch. I would recommend their cheesy tortilla crisp. It is baked like a pizza, covered in melting cheddar cheese and strips of roasted green peppers. If you go, bring your cash. They do not accept anything else but cash. But, it is extremely affordable. Late lunch for 2 including: 2 great margaritas, cheesy pizza and we split the chicken chimi that comes with rice & beans = $25 including tip. We overstuffed ourselves!! We definitely could have gotten by with less for sure. It is located in an old waffle/breakfast house building with a read roof. Very old school, hole in the wall, very friendly service! Smiles abound. It is just a cool place that has been in Phoenix forever and has good cheap food. What's better than that!",1
"Being from TX and OK most of my life, I have a certain expectation for Mexican food, and unfortunately numerous places I tried in Phoenix haven't fit the bill - until I found this place.  Only drawback is the menu is small (no fajitas for example), but if you are looking for good chips and salsa and a good enchilada then look no further.  Keep in mind this place looks like a complete hole, and only takes cash.  Enjoy!",1
"The food here is mediocre at best. I went after reading all the above positive reviews and was really disappointed.  The service was great, hence the 2 stars, but my relleno was soggy and my tamele looked & tasted like it was made in a factory.  The guacamole was decent and at $3 I didn't care that the margarita tasted like a mix.",0
"First time here. Smoked chicken tastes amazing. Salsa is excellent . Water service on point. Food came out quick , hot , and tasty. Decently priced",1
My favorite place. My family has been coming here for generations. ...since they have been opened. Love this place!!!!,1
Perhaps some of the best tacos I have ever had. They had a great smoke flavor to them. The beans and the rice were on par as well. \n\nOur whole table was happy and the service (speed of food too) was really really fast. \n\nI wish they were a bit closer to my side of town.,1
"Love there red sauce for there enchiladas.. FYI, they only accept cash but they do have an ATM.",1
"Good serves. But got bad serves from the owner (cashier). We had no idea it was Cash Only. We ate there before, but had no problems. Until we were ready to pay, he told us Cash Only & said there's an ATM machine. Which we had no problem using, because we didn't feel right leaving a good restaurant without paying. So after getting the money, he got mad because we didn't leave a TIP. We are good citizen and know hardship when it comes to having no money or not having enough money. So we always leave a TIP when we eat out, just that we had no money at that time, we only had a debit card. He should've asked nicely to leave a TIP. But he took $6 from us and said NEVER COME BACK!! Who does and says that??",0
"Cash Only!!  Muy importante!\n\nI kind of feel bad doing this because we ordered the cheeseburger at a Mexican restaurant, but even our worst expectations were blown away.  You get a school cafeteria type burger with a patty as slim and small as McDonalds but without the flavor and fried crispy.  It's such a weird texture...  No tomato or onion, just a little bit of shredded lettuce.  The fries were soggy with oil, obviously not cooked at the right temperature and very unappetizingly brown.  Oy!\n\nI wouldn't rate it so bad just on the cheeseburger, though it was pretty darn bad.  I had a burrito enchilada style with some rice and it had much to be desired as well.  It was edible, there's some dry shredded beef in the middle of a tightly rolled burrito.  The \""""smothering\"""" of enchilada sauce and cheese left much to be desired.  I usually don't like a huge pile of cheese on top but this was laughable as it probably covered maybe half the burrito.  I guess the ration of sauce and cheese is about 2 tablespoons.  \n\nThe chips were good, but I don't think you should be able to call hot sauce salsa.  It's more like hot sauce, no chunks of anything and not much seasoning of anything.\n\nI think I'll check out Del Taco before coming here again sorry to say..",0
So far the many times I have been here this is my first review of this place but it's really good. So far the times I have come it has been worth it to drive from where I live to here.. It's quite good and keeps me going back..,1
"I've been here a handful of time, and have yet to be disappointed. You start with chips and salsa which are nothing more than average. I ordered the Don Jose Special it comes with a tamale, cheese enchilada, shredded beef taco, and a bean tostada, with a choice of rice or beans. Everything was amazing, my personal favorite was the tacos! It's a small restaurant but don't let the size intimidate you, the food is delicious. Best part is their only 2 minutes away from me :)",1
"Absolutely the worst service I have even had in my entire life.  I recently moved here from out of state and was referred to Dr. O'Clair by a coworker.  On my way to the appointment, my GPS took me in a round about way and I knew I would be late so I called ahead. The staff told me that it was not a problem.  I finally got to the office at 4:15 and was asked to sit down. After waiting for another 10 minutes, I was called up to the desk and told that I was MORE than 15 minutes late and had to reschedule my appointment. My appointment was at 4:00, so apparently they cannot tell time.  I explained that I called ahead, got lost and that I was a student who also worked part time so it was very hard for me to reschedule and  the doctor actually refused to see me. The staff was incredibly rude and should have told me not to come in the first place. I left the office in tears out of frustration and embarrassment from the way I was treated. It is clear that Dr. O'Clair has no respect for her patients...as if we have never waited 15 minutes for a doctor before.",0
"Haven't been to the doctor in 5 or 6 years, so I thought I would go and get checked out.  My insurance covers preventative care 100% and I have a large deductible for sick visits.  I went, had no health complaints, and the nurse told me I was the healthiest person she had seen all day.\n\nThe practice then billed a sick visit code to my insurance, which applied $130 to my deductible.  I called the billing number, explained the situation, and asked that they bill the prevantative visit code to my insurance.  The billing person told me the doctors pick the code, not the billing people, but he would check with the doctor and call me back the next day.\n\nHe never called.  I left two voicemails for the billing guy, which he never returned.\n\nI appealed to my insurance, who denied because the doctor used a sick visit code.\n\nSooo, my doctor is still sending me bills for the prevantative visit that is covered 100% by my insurance.  The office is yet to explain the \""""problem of medium to high severity\"""" described is the CPT code.  The only diagnosis billed is V70.0, adult well visit.\n\nThis post is probably more about the billing dept, but still makes me mad.",0
"They charge an annual administrative fee that is not covered by insurance.  Basically, it's like a credit card annual fee.  This year 2012 it's $60.  I'm not one to pay annual fees at my bank, on credit cards, and definitely don't want to start at my doctors office :(  It's up to you though.",0
"i've been seeing dr. goldman for more than 10 yrs..  very happy with him and his staff.  about a yr or so ago, i stopped going to him.  he charged an administrative fee of yearly $35 or something ridiculous for seeing him for paperwork, etc. processing.  Really?  even couldn't be grandfathered in after i complained for being a long standing patient.  he moved from 40th & bell to camelback and i continued to see him.  i didn't ask him for more gas??!!!  i continued to make the much longer trip & nvr complained.  this took the cake.  a drs. office charging an adm fee?  argh! i have since gotten a very nice doctor around the corner i'm happy with but decided since apparently i'm still good enough for their email list and had a yelp link, i'd give my 2 cents worth!!",0
"Finding a new doctor can be a pain. So, when I came to Family Practice Specialists I was pleasantly surprised. Each time I've gone, I've had minimal wait time - and have always been greeted with friendly receptionists and staff. I started seeing Dr. Ungar - who was friendly, comforting and extremely thorough. All things you'd want in a doctor. \n\nI've also found that this office also several doctors on staff that also specialize in other areas, including Women's care issues.  Which will turn out to be very convenient in the future. I recommend!",1
"Let me preface this review:\n\nI live a healthy lifestyle, exercise regularly, don't smoke and rarely drink.  \n\nI rarely go to the doctor and visiting this practice reminded me why. I came in because I've been having trouble sleeping. I made an appointment with KATE MONTGOMERY , RN, CS, FNP.\n\nAll I can say is WOW, I've never felt so judged in my life! She was down right rude! Canceled all my remaining appointments They also charge some BS annual fee not covered by insurance. \n\nI will finding another Doctor that is not so judgmental. If I were you, I would pass on this facility.",0
Our Dr. is great but the administration fee is completely inappropriate.  They charged my wife an annual 49 fee and myself a 49 fee.  We are not going to pay $98 a year to be seen at this facility when they collect our co pay and bill our insurance company.  We will find another provider.,0
"Unfortunately, this administrative fee will prevent me from ever going back.  It's sad b/c I feel the care was really great.",0
"Well the administration fee is true and now I will not be going back.  You have got to be kidding me.  Like someone stated earlier, I pay a copay every time I go in there and they bill my insurance for anything additional they do.  This is total BS.  I thought I was going to the doctor not a gym.  The Doctors are good there, but it is soooo slow.  If you have a 10am appointment, don't expect to get in before at least 10:30am.\n\nI called and I was told this fee was to offset the cost of the Lab, EMR and Patient Portal cost.  I'm not sure what Lab they are referring to because every time I have blood drawn they send it off to some place called LabCorp.  Isn't this the cost of doing business?  So should I start deducting a set amount for the employees that work for me for the cost of internet and the payroll system we use?  I don't think so.",0
"I've been a patient of Dr. Wyse for several years. I have always booked my appointments first thing in the morning to avoid waiting in the 'little white room' too long. After the third time of waiting over an hour after arriving at 7:30 in the morning and nothing more than a \""""i'm very booked\"""" as an apology, I've decided it's best to move on and find a new family doctor. \n\nThere are some rare services or individuals that are worth the extra wait. This, unfortunately, is not one of them. I find it very arrogant when anyone feels their time is more important than yours.",0
"I have used yelp to find doctors in the past. I found a wonderful doctor through Yelp who unfortunately closed his practice. :(  I can't say strongly enough, use this Yelp review and find another doctor.  I wish I had read the reviews on this practice before I went for my first appointment. It would have saved me a lot of unnecessary stress.",0
"It took me several years to find a family doctor that I could truly trust. I found Dr. Goldman about 2.5 years ago after having a severe allergic reaction and he was able to help me pin-point the cause and put me on a path to recovery.  Dr. Goldman and his nurse Maddie are truly great!\nI am saddened to say I am now leaving this practice because of a silly Admin fee they have now introduced along with a calling list they put their patients on to receive recorded advertising messages of medical services they provide. Really, you want me to pay $49 a month so you can send me infomercial voicemails to spend more money at your practice?!?!  I am generally a healthy person and maybe visit the doctor once or twice a year.  They already bill my insurance up the wazoo and also charge me a co-pay every visit, is that not enough?   Maybe if this doctors office was a luxurious spa, with outstanding customer service, would I consider spending a yearly fee.",0
Great service and they had what I came for. Some work boots. Rand H. and I called in first to make sure they had what we were looking for and they did indeed. Big 5 Gets my big 5 stars!,1
"This store NEVER has what I'm looking for (hiking pants, baseball cap, sports jersey, any type of college or professional team gear (I think they just have ASU stuff)etc.), everything looks picked over as if I have just missed the motherload of all sales on sporting schtuff. \n\nI have tried to give them business on 4 separate occasions and always leave empty handed.  \n\nAnother turnoff is that the people lurking around the inside and outside of the store kinda creep me out. It's almost like a Cabela's (they sell firearms, hunting knives, and whatnot) but lame.  Sorry, but I won't be back.",0
Spinning.  Hardcore.  That about sums it up.  Give it a try if you want a workout that will totally kick your ass and leave you crying.,1
This place might well be cited for disturbing the peace. On week-end mornings one can often hear the throbbing bass beat inside of other nearby businesses and even out in the parking lot.  The ambience reminds me of a low-rider with one of those souped-up stereos that you can feel coming down the road long before you can hear it. Seems like I've been front and center at punk rock shows that had less prominent bass lines than this place has on Sunday mornings.,0
"I love studio 360!! It is an Arcadia institution. If you live in Arcadia and you have not been here...that's fine because I don't want you taking my bike, but you really are missing out! If you like working out in a group without feeling like everyone is staring at you this is perfect because it's dark (with the exception of the occasional black light). Spinning at 360 is group exercise but like yoga it is individual with a sense of group support. It is drop saddle style, so you stand the entire class, which I actually find easier than the alternative. It's good for people who enjoy dance as well, it is very rhythmic. Best work out I have ever had, but you don't have to be a work out freak to enjoy 360. The instructors are great. If you are new to it I suggest Tues night with Denise. Always show up at least 15 minutes early to get a spot and learn how to ride. Their motto is \""""to see the light you have to ride like hell in the dark\"""" :) Enjoy!",1
"Very few spinning classes in Phoenix so limited of where you go. But as far as decent bikes, good instructors and great sound system, 360 will give you a workout, your legs moving and your heart beat way up. The yoga is in a separate part of the building and is very small space.",1
"Love spinning here! It's always a hard workout and I've only been to the beginner classes - can't imagine what the advanced ones are like.\n\nThe Mon and Wed evening teachers are great and play fun music. After a crazy day at work, this is the perfect outlet and a great way to clear your mind.\n\nThe only other spin class I've done were at LA Fitness - these are 100x better. It's intense, you never sit down, black lights and fun music and everyone is super nice and helpful.\n\nI've been coming here for more than a year and would recommend it to anyone!",1
"I've been to both Yoga and Spin classes at this studio and really each of them.  I'll break them down...\n\nYoga:  I have been to almost every yoga studio and town and 360 is definitely one of my favorites.  It has a great, open vibe to it and the teachers are fantastic.  I've been to 4 or 5 different instructors and they are all really good (Lonnie and Ana are my favorite).  I get a good workout - and feel totally energized after.  I started going to 360 a few months ago and my yoga was very beginner and I was pretty rusty.  But I felt totally comfortable in every class going at my own pace.  They've got a lot of different types of classes and a pretty decent schedule.  Try them out!\n\nSpin:  The spin classes were a little overwhelming for me at first.  They ride drop saddle (meaning you are standing the whole time) - so that was hard for me to get used to.  But, after I went to a few classes I got the hang of it and was able to get an amazing workout.  Definitely makes you sweat!  Finding a teacher who plays good music is key because it makes the class fly by (Cinnaree and Laura are awesome).  I ended up buying my own spin shoes, but they have ones you can borrow at first which I thought was nice.  \n\nPlus, both types of classes are really reasonably priced compared to other local studios - not easy to find.",1
"I'll preface this review by saying this is the first Yelp review I have ever written. I've thought about writing a review before, after a fantastic meal, a so-so gym, etc. etc. but I've never been so compelled as I am right now to give feedback about my experience with this studio. And one more thing - I work in the health industry, in a job that is very much customer service-oriented, and I genuinely am not writing this for the purpose of bashing a well-intended small business. I am also a pretty serious recreational mountain biker (point being, I'm more than comfortable and well versed with the right way to ride a bike). I do hope this review serves as constructive-criticism, which is why I've also emailed the studio this exact feedback. \n\nI had arrived with a half full stainless steel water bottle and asked if there was anywhere I could fill it up. (I try not to drink water of out plastic bottles, for both health and environmental reasons.) I was told by the employee at the front desk that, no, there was not but I could purchase water. Really? I've been to A LOT of fitness centers, from big-box gyms to small boutique-style studios, and I have never NOT been able to fill up a reusable water bottle. (I tried from the bathroom too, but faucet wasn't high enough). \n\nMy primary complaints with the class itself include the following: \n\n-Standing up on the bike the entire 60 min. just doesn't make biomechanical sense. Don't get me wrong, coming in and out of the saddle throughout a spin class can be a great way to add some variety, intensity, and fun to the workout. Standing up though is more quad-dominant and neglects the \""""pull\"""" movement of the hamstrings compared to sitting. Why would a studio have classes that ONLY has riders standing for every class, all class? Recipe. For. Injury. \n\n-Spin classes are upbeat. The music blasts. It gets loud. I get that, I dig that... that's why I choose to pay to attend one, rather than working out on a stationary bike on my own. The problem was that I couldn't hear a SINGLE word the instructor was saying the ENTIRE class. Perhaps the mic wasn't turned up enough or something but I honestly could not figure out what she was saying, the few times she was saying something. I actually started doing my own intervals about half way through because I was so frustrated. \n\n-Intervals or what? Granted I couldn't hear what the teacher was saying, but from what I gathered we were performing 1 minute intervals with 30 seconds recovery time in between. Intervals are awesome, here's why: you work at a higher intensity during the work time and a lower intensity during the rest time. Your heart rate gets higher for a short term and then recovers and a result, you train all of your body's energy systems, rather than just aerobic. Your resting metabolic rate also stays elevated for much longer after higher intensity intervals. With that said, we weren't doing intervals. The teacher was encouraging riders to only use the recovery time if they needed it. If you don't need recovery time, you're not doing intervals. You NEED recovery time to do intervals, otherwise you're simply working at a steady state the whole time.... which is what the class was.\n\n-Music came to a complete stop between songs. I've taught group exercise classes before. It never goes perfectly, I totally get that. But to completely stop the music between every single song before finding the next one to play? Come on. \n\n-Lack of instruction. When you pay to participate in a group exercise class, spin classes included, you are paying for the instruction of the teacher, the subject-matter expert. Not all teachers have the same style of instruction (which is great), but they all should have SOME form of instruction. On a spin bike, this should include cuing body position on the bike - for example, reminding riders to keep their cores engaged, their shoulders relaxed, arm/hand position, proper breathing,  etc. Cues like these are especially important in order for the rider to get the most out of their workout, but perhaps more importantly, to stay free from injuries on and off a bike. The instructor last night gave absolutely ZERO body position instruction. \n\n-Encouraging riders to sway from side to side on a stationary bike is ridiculous. In fact, it's probably the #1 piece of advice that any responsible exercise professional would warn against. How about teaching the riders how to properly engage their core muscles for functional strength, rather than show them how exert energy through their lower extremities without ANY core stability? \n\nWith all of this said, you will sweat in this class. But just because you leave with a drenched shirt and tired legs doesn't mean that what you're doing to your body is, in the long-run, healthy. This could be a GREAT little spin studio if they took the value of sound instruction a bit more seriously and started teaching the riders who are paying money to come to class how to ride a bike.",0
"I stumbled across this class by accident. I had done spinning at home in the UK and had tried an LA Fitness class here in Phoenix which was ... ok. I came to Studio 360 and couldn't believe I didn't collapse in a crumpled heap on the floor. Somehow I kept going to the end of the class. It was HARD. I was completely addicted.\n\nI have since been going for probably about 6 months. In that time my father in the UK has been diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor and I really can be honest in saying that going to this class 2/3 times a week is the only time when I have 60 minute periods in which I don't feel like I'm crippled with fear and dread about what is happening at home. \n\nOh, and I've dropped 2 dress sizes. It would probably be more, but I REALLY like wine (I'm European. We drink. Too much.) So what my boyfriend affectionately refers to as my \""""wine pouch\"""" reamins. But I have abs underneath. \n\nMost importantly - for 60 minutes of the day I feel like a champion.\n\nThank you Studio 360.",1
Best spin class I've ever taken. Been going here 3 years now and it just gets better!,1
"I have a been an athlete my whole life and I was even a runner for awhile but with the way I was dreading running these days I thought I'd try something new. It was my first spin class and I was pretty anxious because I had no idea what to expect.\n\nAs soon as I walked in I was put at ease. The employees were extremely friendly and welcoming. They got me some shoes to borrow, they showed me what to expect and how things were done. They even helped me clip into the bike. \n\nThe class was all girls that night so I really felt this sense of unity or dare I say girl power. Everyone was friendly and supportive. I think I can even make friends here to hang out with socially. The class was fun and challenging. It was like working out in a dance club. I loved it. I bought a card to come back for more classes and the prices are better than their competitors. They also have times that fit my schedule much better than other spin classes around town.\n\nThe only downside was how sore I was after my first class, but that's to be expected so it's really not a downside after all. I am a cheerleader for Spin 360. I back it.",1
"OK, full disclosure, this was my first \""""spin\"""" class. I'm usually seen on a road bike, and in daylight. \n\nThe class amazing, the music perfect, attitude great and the work out..fantastic! I will be going back. It was a little difficult to get the 'moves' down that are particular to this studio, but I was told everyone goes through it. \n\nSimply put, it was the most fun I've had doing a workout. =)  Good job!",1
"I decided to take the plunge and finally try a spinning class.   Glad that it was here, a perfect environment to feel like a newbie. (The spin studio is dark, really dark.  Arrive with plenty of time to find a bike and to adjust it for your frame & body.)  I was greeted at 8:45am by the instructor and spinning phenom, Samantha.  She played great music and inspired everyone to push harder.She would turn up the music occasionally when the black light was on, it became also trance or rave- like.\n\nAfter visiting a few more spin classes at the Village on Camelback, I learned that Studio 360 is a stand-up studio (they rarely sit down when riding.)  After more spin practice, I will return and see if I can ride standing up the whole time.\n\nSorry that I missed out on the Yoga Studio 360, that segment of the business ended a few months ago.",1
"My mom and I used to go here at least twice a week, it is the most amazing workout ever. I just wish I could do it every day. I love the music, and the energy!!\n\nIf you want a workout that is fun and also pushes you and gives you wonderful results go here!",1
I like Subs by Jim. I tried their Egg Salad sandwich and they just piled it up! I couldn't finish it and only ate half a sandwich 'cause it was huge. The place is operated by an Asian guy and his wife. The place is cozy.,1
"I remember driving by this bar a couple of years ago and laughing out loud because the parking lot was packed at 8am.  I was asking myself, who the HELL *are* these people, getting loaded this early?!\n\nFast forward two years later, and I've become one of \""""those people\""""  Well, with the caveat that I'm not getting loaded.\n\nNow I figger that my excuse is about as good as they come.  I'm working nights from 6pm to 6am, and after putting in a 12 hour shift, sometimes a man wants to have a damn drink, get something to eat, read the newspaper, relax a bit.  This avoids the unwelcome alternative of \""""unwinding\"""" by drinking at home alone at 7am,  which tends to generate feelings of being a total loser.\n\nSo anyway, ye Old Brass Rail opens bright and early at 6am, which is perfect.  As with any bar opening at this hour, there is your contingent of old man alkeeholic regulars, but this particular place also seems to be popular with the nurses getting off the night shift at a nearby hospital.  They usually enter in groups of 2-4, ordering double long island ice teas, and getting their drink on in their scrubs.  Some of them are even cute.\n\nThe service is attentive and low-key.  Drinks are cheap and there are several breakfast specials available for under $5.   The food is nothing amazing but it gets the job done and the price is definitely right.   The first time I walked out of there after paying $7 for breakfast with a tall  gin and grapefruit juice, I knew that I had found a winner.\n\nThere is a smoking patio with misters, but much to my dismay I got bawled out one day for taking a plate of pancakes out there. APPARENTLY, there is no food served on the patio, nor is the consumption of food that you have brought out to the patio yourself tolerated.  The reason given was pretty lame too, it basically boiled down to the fact that they didn't want to deal with people bitching about smoke ruining their breakfast, or something, blah blah blah.   So far, that has been my only negative experience at this place.\n\nThe joint could use face lift, like another reviewer mentioned, but doing so might erase some of its character.\n\nJust watch your step on the way out the door, there's a slight incline that's easy to get tripped up on. :-O  Regulars will back me up on this.",1
"The Old Brass Rail has replaced Ihops and Denny's pretty much completely for me.  The breakfast is just perfect for me and its 3 bucks!  2 eggs any way you want it, 3 bacon/sausage, hash browns and 2 slices of toast.  I eat pretty much all of it and I'm neither stuffed and slothy nor wanting more.  3 bucks!\n\nI gotta say once in a while the bacon is a little bit too crispy, and the hash browns aren't as crispy as I like it, but hey for 3 bucks I'm taking that risk every time!  And its not like I haven't paid more for flops at a more expensive place before.  \n\nI would also recommend the spicy/seasoned fries.  Very good.  Other than that, the sandwiches and burgers are pretty run of the mill.  Good pricing of course.\n\nThey also have dinner specials.  I think something like meat loaf dinners and pork chop dinners on certain nights for like 5 bucks.  Never tried it but have been meaning to.\n\nAll in all, this place is pretty awesome once you get past the dark, dingy atmosphere.  But I think its on purpose.  :)",1
"I went in for the cheap breakfast for the first time at noon today. I had the $3 plate. It was okay. My toast was perfect & buttery. I was going to have the $4.75 plate with french toast until I learned it came with one slice of toast! That was very disappointing to learn the price jumps a $1.75 and you get only one slice of dipped toast but could get two pancakes, it doesn't make sense. I wonder how big and fluffy the pancakes are, but not enough to risk it and order them. I just don't get it, why they think one slice of french toast is a fair deal. \nAnyhow the eggs and bacon came with that, they were cooked okay. Could have done a more presentable delivery of the meal at home. Have seen a more presentable job done at many other eateries through out the USA at independently owned or chain restaurants. So I'm in no rush to return here for the breakfast, even if it is cheap. Unlike some I won't be abandoning other long standing breakfast joints for this. After all you get what you pay for. And i prefer my breakfast in a sunny and brighter place as well verses a dark drab bar, but to each their own choice.",0
"For some reason, probably a reason associated with heavy drinking habits and/or retardation, I can't ever remember the name of this place.  Since I'm unable to, whenever I bug my coworkers to go there I simply make up a new name for it.  For example:\n\n\""""hey guys, we should go to old Mcdonalds house of Brass Railroad Tracks.\""""\n\nor\n\n\""""Hey, lets go to Brass Traintrack Rails at noon.\""""\n\nSince most of my coworkers have not been afflicted with heavy drinking habits and/or retardation they know what I'm talking about.\n\nI sought this place out as a lunch time place during work hours since often I crave a simple beer for lunch instead of caloric \""""food.\""""  Usually my fellow workers and I will end up at the Dirty Drummer, since it's right across the street from our office building.  This was fine for a while until I realized that The Dirty Drummer is actually fucking gross, the atmosphere is depressing and the servers are visually annoying.  Thanks to my obsession with Yelp and alcohol, I was able to find this little gem, a simple and tasty dive bar that is literally four minutes from our office.  \n\nOld Brass Rail is large and not at all intrusive, it's not so local that everyone looks at you when you walk in and it's not so detached that they don't care that you're there.  Plus, they have those high top bar tables that are fun to sit at, especially when they're spread out and you don't have to hear other people's conversations.  They have a million flat screen TV's for when the conversation slows or when you dine with boys who are distracted by lights and moving objects around them.\n\nI've only been there twice, both times we had the same server, both times all my comrads ordered the amazingly reasonable and genius idea of a three dollar breakfast until 2 p.m.  Everyone loves breakfast, and to serve a cheap breakfast at a BAR until 2 p.m. is god damn fucking brilliant.  The server was super nice, sweet and friendly, remembered us, offered suggestions, was not put off by the fact that we are an unlikely group to be at bar in the middle of a weekday.  I can honestly say that both times I thoroughly enjoyed my Old Brass Railroad Tracks experience. \n\nI didn't order breakfast because I am not a \""""breakfast food\"""" person.  I order lunch, even in the morning.  I ordered the chicken strips and a salad, I've also had the fries.  Everything was what you expect as far as bar food but genuinely not gross, with the added bonus that it was NOT, in fact, The Dirty Drummer.  Also, it's not over priced for what it is, 7 for an app, 7 for a burger, cheap beers, good specials, 4.50 pitchers, such a great find.  Also, 3.50 breakfast AT A BAR- GENIUS.  In addition to the totally acceptable food, pleasant service and good prices, you get the added bonus of checking out an old school cigarette vending machine on your way out.  I hope to return to Train Tracks of Brass Railroad Bar soon.",1
"This is a great place to come for breakfast. \nIt's cheap and yummy. You can get hashbrowns, eggs, biscuits & gravy and bacon all for $5.50 and its a large portion. I also love that they cook their Bacon properly and its not fatty or gross and limp.\nNot only is the breakfast awesome, but the drinks are strong and the service is always friendly and on point.",1
"Maybe it's because I was drinking heavily (which is NOT a usual occurance!) but I really liked this little hole in the wall!  The server was fantastic!  She kept our glasses filled at just the right times (which was way too many!)  I don't think most people tip well here because she was shocked with a good cash tip. (So when you go...be nice and tip well!)   The bathroom was clean, the music was great!  The band was ReGroove, and it was just a fun night!  The clientele was interesting ;o) Drinks were pretty strong and cheap!  We'll be back for sure!",1
"Food poisoning alert. There is no doubt in my mind that this incident was caused by the order of potato skins I was served at this un-fine dining establishment. First off, the cook looks like somebody off the street, at least wear an apron buddy. \n   Now we are watching the games there and it's about 30 minutes after I eat 4 fairly large skins which I dipped in sour cream and the rumbling in the stomach started. Five minutes later, I was depositing those skins in their tiny toilet and trying to hold on while the games ended. Lastly, another stop was needed on way home to drop off some more skins. This place is full of local drunks, but a good watering hole (yeah literally). Go here to drink and stay away from all food. Also, it was 8 bucks for one order of skins. Why do places charge the same price for apps as they do for sandwiches. It's another sign of a clueless place with poor food and hygiene. Bad choice.",0
"Came here with a friend yesterday for breakfast. The food was good and the service was excellent. They have lots of televisions so I was able to watch the inauguration and highlights from the playoff games while I enjoyed my food. They have a standard two egg, hash browns, and bacon or sausage for $4 but I went for the $6 option and added pancakes.",1
"Denny's + a local dive bar = The Ole Brass Rail\nThis place is nasty dog. Only had 1 beer here, but the poor ventilation left me smelling like greasy hash browns.  Was misled by the sign that indicated that this was a sports bar.   It's not, it's a sketchy dive bar in a sketchy area that for some reason specializes in breakfast food.  If you eat anything here, say your prayers before and after you eat.",0
"First off let me tell you that my husband and I have been making this a regular stop about 8-10 times a month. When we have to go to a couple stores and we we stop there first to have a meal because it is across the street.  One I had worked till 3:30am and had not woken till about 10:30 am and When my husband said we had to go to a couple stores I suggested a stop for something to eat at what had been one of my favorite places. Good food, mostly nice service friendly atmosphere and seemingly clean. My husband always orders for me so he asked what I wanted. I told him I would like coffee with my food because I was cold  then I might have something after eating. I ate my taco's my husband ate his breakfast.  When the second person came around he asked if he could get us anything else. I asked for a rum and coke. he said something to the effect of he wasn't serving anymore drinks that day. We actually thought he was joking then he brought us the bill. I asked him again for a drink and he said I looked drunk. Tired maybe but hadn't had anything to drink that day. I paid my check and told him that we would not be back. He said, \"""" who cares\"""". He heard my husband order coffee from the other barmaid with my meal. My husband always orders for me. Point is that although they stay busy most times they just lost over $200+ a month because of his behavior. Maybe they should think to ask the person they took over for what the story was. Did my shopping and now I will go spend my money somewhere else.",0
"This used to be our favorite breakfast place.  Now the food is hit or miss and service is very spotty.  Sometimes they're really slow, sometimes they just get the order all wrong.\n\nLast time we were there, our eggs over hard came out easy, the bacon was like jerky (which I didn't really mind), and the hash browns were burnt on the bottom.  My dry english muffins were sogged down with butter (squeezed a tbs out of each half).\n\nLike I say, its been spotty so I think I'll give it some time before I try them again.. :/",0
"Down-home live music dive that's family owned and offers a great value for the money. Cheap drinks, good food, no cover (usually). Opens at 6 am most days. Get over here.",1
"Okay, here's the scoop. I went into Pruitt's in January, hot little Visa card in hand, ISO of a nice, big comfy sectional that they could deliver in two weeks (I had just moved into a new house). Salesperson Elaida (run if she comes up to you ... and: she has no last name on her card, I should have known ...) said 'No problem, they tell us we have to say three weeks, but it will be there in two!\"""" Okay, sounds good. More than two but less than four grand later, said couch was paid for and supposedly on its way to my new home. (I think you know the rest, but I'll continue.) Two weeks later. Nothing. Three, nothing. I call. Oh, it had to be shipped. It will be there right away! Shipped? I call in mid-February. 'They ran out of fabric ... it will be there the first week of March!' They're making it? She said it was in stock. Well gang, it's the first week of March, so I call again today. Now it's looking like the end of March AT BEST because it is being MADE overseas (so much for the assurance that this was a stock item ... and it's being made in Taiwan). Long story short, Pruitt's kept my $$$ for 7 weeks ... did nothing ... never called ... and lied when I called them ... repeatedly. So I made them give me my money back this morning. Save yourself time and trouble!! I didn't even buy one of the (many) cheap couches they have and they still treated me this way. Shop elsewhere! Oh ... and if you know somewhere I can buy a nice, big comfy sectional ... let me know.",0
"My sofa was delivered as promised without any real issues.  The sofa had a medium dirt smudge on the side despite being delivered in plastic.  I was told the delivery team would call me when they were 30 minutes from my place but they showed up without a call.  Regardless, they were friendly and efficient.  I'll be purchasing an occasional chair in the near future and I'll definitely make Pruitt's my first stop.",1
Pruitts was just ok. The place is a little trashed. The prices were ok but not as aggressive as they used to be. The service wasn't very good either granted it is a furniture store though.,0
"Furniture is great and have used Pruitt's for over 10 years. We have purchased carpet twice from them and the first time we had shipping and production issues and had to be on cement floors for a month and finally I had to suggest us changing to a different color as it took that long for them to let me know what the issue was. We purchased carpet almost two years ago from them again on another home and I have had them out 3 times to re-stretch it, the manufacturer came out and said he was going to replace some of it as it seems it was a bad roll but that has never happened and no one ever follows-up I have to call every month to get an update. Now we are waiting on an independent inspector who was suppose to call us three weeks ago and still no word from them or Pruitts. Buy the furniture but not the carpet...",0
Great place to buy any piece of furniture. The sales folk don't hound you to death and I found the living room set I bought from Pruitt's for hundreds of dollars more in other stores. They have earned my business.,1
I have been loyal to Pruitt's  for years but after this last ordeal will not shop there any longer.   I purchased a recliner that was a floor model and was wobbly.   I wa promised that it would be fixed before delivery' but it was delivered broken.    Then I scheduled a technician to come out and fix it.   He ended up taking it back to fix it and I cannot get it delivered because I work and cannot be home for delivery on their schedule.   They said if I return it they would charge a 20% restocking fee.   So I still do not have my recliner.\nWorst customer service ever.,0
"Good prices but bad service.   I shopped and found a nice set for a good price.  I went home measured and ordered online in the morning on a Thursday.  Later on Thursday early evening I had not received a call.  I called the store and confirmed they received the order.   I had requested a Saturday morning delivery online.   The rep told me that usually they have a 4 day window for deliveries but he would do me a \""""favor\"""" and schedule it for Saturday.   Are you JOKING?  The competitors all have next day delivery.   I had to be nice since I wanted the Sat. Delivery so I thanked him.  On Saturday morning I had not received a call.   I called and they said the store does not call, the customer has to call for a delivery time.  Oy!   HELLO, the customer should not have to work so hard!   The delivery was delayed past the 430 time and you guessed it they NEVER called.   I threatened to cancel the order and it was at my home 15 minutes later.   I will NEVER go back.  They lost another customer.",0
"I purchased a $2500 sectional from them. It was beautiful and I was in love the minutes I saw the carmel colored beauty. Within six months a peice of the frame came loose and pertruded through the fabric in the back. I called them and they sent someonne out to repair it. within  6 months it was broken again. They refused to fix it stating that it was outside of the year. I understand that placed have to set a time limit, but the fact that it broke twice in such a short time is ridiculous! I still have furniture to buy for my home and they are not on the list of companies that I would ever do business with again. In my opinion a $75-$100 repair should be handled as a courtesy for my inconvenience but they would rather lose the business. I have purchased the sectional and a matress for one of my guest bedrooms, but nothing again!",0
"This place is awful BEWARE you may want to go someone else that actually cares about they're customers and doesn't lie to them just to get a sale.\n\nI bought a mattress set, was told it'd be delivered in the morning before Sat before 10a, I remember that because I thought to myself oh man I'm gonna have to wake up early, then Sat 11a comes around, I call to find out what's going on they said I was scheduled for an afternoon delivery, thanks sales lady, wouldn't be a huge issue excet that I have places to be in a few hours, the lady says she'll see what she can do, calls back 10 mins later, well your stuffs on the truck and they said it'll be 2 to 3 hours, WHAT?!, I proceeded to ask her what can I do, can they leave it in my backyard, she then decided to hang up on me. Wonderful!!\n\nI will never give these rude unprofessional liars any of my money again. I wish I could just return the thing and go some where better. But they have a policy where all sales are final. Weird policy and now I'm guessing they do things like this a lot and that's why there is this policy.  \n\nI should have listened to my gut feeling while I was purchasing the set and walked out. So if you end up in this awful place and you have a great desire to run. RUN!!!!",0
"Great Service and Value..  I was shopping for a new sectional and found several in the showroom.  $65 flat fee for shipping to Fountain Hills, so I also purchased two Gel mattresses.  The store service was straight forward and excellent, and so was the delivery.  Employees from purchase to delivery were friendly and helpful, and the delivery was on time with no complications.  We really love the new beds and sectional sofa.. Will definitely purchase from Pruitt's again..",1
"No customer service! I have spent since September waiting for a replacement part on a sofa where the technician from Pruitt's said \""""the leather is bad\"""". I have been given the run around ever since. They've given me delivery dates of October, then beginning of December, then January. Here it is February and they claim to know nothing. They refused to provide me with the manufacturer phone number, owners number or email address. They claimed they don't have that information! Ha! I looked up the manufacturer myself and called them... Had the answer is 5 minutes that I've been waiting on for over a week. These people are uninterested in helping once they have your money. We've purchased lots of items from them in the last 10 years and their quality has gone way down as has their respect for the people who spend money there. Never again!! Please consider purchasing from another store who will care to treat their long time or any  customers well.",0
"I bought a sofa yesterday - but it wasn't from Pruitts.  I do thank them for having a large selection and being the only store I went to that had a sofa I wanted though.  Helped me to be able to find it online, shipped to my door for less than their price.\n\nThat said, if one of the seemingly 10,000 sales people there would have shown even the slightest interest in making the sale, I would have bought it there and been done.\n\nInstead we walked about 30% of the way through the first floor without anyone saying a word.  I stopped and asked a sales lady (and I am 110% positive she worked there as she was JUST helping someone else) if upstairs was more sofas.  She ignored me.  Flat out ignored.  Thinking perhaps she didn't hear, my husband said something to her about being too busy to acknowledge, and STILL she ignored us.  So we wandered up there on our own.\n\nAbout 80% of the way though the store, and after making eye contact with at least a dozen other sales people and smiling as I normally do, one finally decided to ask if we needed any help.  I said we were looking for small love-seats.  He pointed us to the direction of the entrance, where we had been, and said that was it.\n\nWell, so we went back to the entrance to the one sofa I initially saw and liked.   I was sitting on it, laying on it, taking pictures to send to a designer friend, measuring, etc in the same room about 10 feet away from FOUR sales men and not a single one asked if we needed help, had questions, etc.\n\nThere was also I rug I was keen on, except for the colors.  This was Hubby's conversation with the sales man closest to him:\nHubby: Hey, do you work here?\nSales Guy:  Yes\nH:  I have a question about this rug\nS:  Oh, we work in rooms.  I don't work in this room.  I don't know anything about it\nH:  OK, so you can't help me then?\nS:  Nope. \nAnd he walked away.  No offer of getting someone to help, or asking what the question was, NOTHING.\n\nSo - we walked out.  And I decided even if I couldn't find that sofa elsewhere, I wasn't buying it there.  And I won't be back.",0
"Put it this way:  the only reason they are getting two stars (instead of one) is the fact that they DO have reasonable prices, pretty large selection, and I felt like the salesman was informative and helpful.  \n\nBut God forbid anyone waits on their delivery.  As soon as they make a sale and obtain the additional $65 for delivery, all bets are off.  They're not interested in delivering your furniture at the times they tell you they will.  They just simply.  don't.  care.   \n\nAnd for that, I won't ever be shopping there again, nor would I recommend my friends to go here either.",0
"I've bought a number of items over the years from here, and this place has by far the best pricing:quality ratio.  The service is friendly when you walk in, and nobody is pushing sales on you like other furniture stores.  The shipping was awesome!  You have to call at 9am the day your items are to be delivered.  They will then tell you what stop you are and an approximate window, and will call when they are 15 minutes away.  I highly recommend getting your furniture here!",1
"I'm a small business owner who is in a constant need of recliners. They were unwilling to help me find a good time for delivery, I'm also a mom, it's hard to find child care , or be on call for an entire day. I set my delivery up for a Saturday. I asked if there were any chance i could have a window of time allotted, even 4 hours. They said no and suggested I cancel my order. I said no no, I want my chairs please deliver them and I'll deal with whatever happens it'll be ok. So I called this am to ask when they'd come, she said you cancelled your order. I said , no I didn't cancel, there must be a miscommunication, She said no there's no miscommunication. I don't know where I come from the customer is always right. I should've cancelled my order there. But still i naively thought its ok, I'll get my chairs... It's 10pm. I have a child to get home to. What do they expect?  A person to wait and wait and wait and to be treated like dirt in the mean time. Next time ill pay more just to be treated like a human whose money means something real. Thanks Pam \n\n\nAs I write this it's 10pm on Saturday, my order is still not here.",0
What you see is not always what you get. The delivered item was a deep chocolate brown instead of the light brown in the showroom. Someone should have advised me before delivery as color was one of the main deciding factors in the purchase.  Also there were irregularities like the pillow back is short and overstuffed instead of the skinny height of the floor model and even the arms are lower. It's a disappointment.....,0
Pruitts asked me to email them to allow them an opportunity to make it right. So i did. Haven't heard anything else back.,0
"I have to agree with Patti B. that this location pretty much sucks.  The service is just ok - they are far from friendly.  I've been in  a couple of times to pick up food and I have yet to be impressed.  I wanted to give them another chance tonight and I should not have bothered.  The food is not so good.  I'd rather go to Pita Jungle or Thai Llana any day!  The spring rolls are greasy and room temperature and the tofu is pretty nasty.  I had some kind of udon noodle dish and threw most of it in the garbage.  Use your 'free entree' coupon to save $$ one night, but that's about it... I will not be returning to (this) Pei Wei any time soon...",0
"First off, I'll say that it seems like everytime I eat here I'm a little disappointed. It's like I have a craving for it, but it doesn't deliver. I honestly think it's overpriced and not as good as PF Chang's - for a few bucks more I would much rather eat at Chang's...better atmosphere, better food. At any rate we do go here once and awhile since the 44th & Indian school location is by my house. Plus having 2 little ones, it's much easier to do take-out than a sit down restaurant. My husband & I both usually get the teriyaki chicken bowl and ask them to add extra veggies. We also like the crab wontons, but the lettuce wraps are nowhere near as good as Chang's.",0
"I am not sure what's up will all of the negative reviews. The food has been pretty consistent, and actually the service is great. Even for carry out, they usually offer you a drink while you wait.  Never had a bad food experience here.  In fact, I think I am going to head out right now for some soup.",1
"Pei Wei, you give Pad Thai a bad name.",0
"let me start out with the positive: the service was excellent.  really.  for a restaurant where i order at a counter and THEN sit down, i wasn't expecting much.  but the service staff brought my food promptly, quickly removed my plates, and offered me to-go boxes and a refill.  \n\nunfortunately, i have high expectations for asian food (especially thai food), and i was sadly disappointed by the curry.  so bland.  so so bland.  and the crab rangoon was nothing to write home about either.  \n\ni may consider trying it again if i need to grab a really quick bite, but i wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",0
"Big fan!\n\nThis probably one of the busier ones in town and I am always in and out. I love that you can order online!!! Just quick pop online, order what you want, the web page even guids you through the manu easier, and even pick exactly when you want it to be ready.\n\nMy favorite is the lettuce wrapps and the PeiWei Spicy Chicken! Must try them!\n\nMoral of the day, when getting take out, order online! Way fast and you even get 25% your entire order the first tiem you do. Love it!",1
"I've tried and tried to find something I like at these restaurants and I just can't come up with a reason to go back. \n\nI tried the Lo Mein with chicken. It smelled good but, what I got was 3 lbs of noodles in an overly sweet sauce with a few julienne carrots and few sprouts. The chicken was dry and chewy. I just don't get the draw.",0
Went here with friends and have been to other locations. This location was different than the rest though.the food came out overlooked to the point of tasting burned. Was not impressed.,0
This place has been a favorite of mine since it opened as a cheaper and faster alternative to Pf. Chang's. I almost always order the Pad Thai and/or the Lettuce Wraps. Both of which are amazing. I always make I stop at Pei Wei when visiting AZ. Oh and the new Soda machine is amazing.,1
Only thing I've tasted so far that was palatable is the Wonton Soup.,0
i have their phone number programmed into my phone!\n\ntheir lettuce wraps are just as good as p.f. chang's\n\ntheir pad thai is not bad at all!,1
"we visited on april 15th and And also Sunday April 22..\nI have twice now gone to your restaurant and twice been told that I couldnt use my BOGO coupon. The first time my mother went to pick up our order, she was told we didnt order the right food and we had to order off the main entress. The second time we ordered, I was told that we had to order off of the DINER SELECT menu. I did not have my coupon handy, and when I was able to read it, it says specifically, \""""Offer valid for one complimentary Diner Select with the purchase of another entree. Complimentary Diner Select must be of equal or lesser value to purchase entree. Valid entrees include SIGNATURE DISHES, BOWLS, SALADS, DINER SELECTS AND LETTUCE WRAPS.\"""" So why, on two separate occasions were we told conflicting information and not allowed to use the coupon, thus spending a small fortune on food, TWICE?!?!? Your customer service is far from what it used to be and I doubt you will be getting more of our business any time in the near future.",0
"The staff at this location was very friendly but I was not impressed by the food. It was too salty and lacking in other flavors. It may have been the dish I had because I have heard good things from others. However, I'm not tempted to try it again.",0
Was at one of your Phoenix locations and witness the most disgusting thing!!! Food was brought for take out and fell over the counter the employee scrapped it back with the lid and put it back in the bowel and set it aside ready for the customer to pick up. Will never eat there again!!!,0
"I don't consider myself a connoisseur of Asian cuisine, especially streamlined Asian-American cuisine that's one step above fast food, but I will say this. The caramel chicken takeout dish comes with a separate small container for the vegetable slaw that goes on top. There is absolutely no excuse for a piece of broken eggshell the size of a thumbnail finding its way into the slaw container. Not to mention there was raw egg goop still attached to it. This has been one of several issues I've recently had with this location's food and service. The previous two times, the pad thai I ordered contained NO tofu whatsoever, when I know that's part of the Pei Wei pad thai recipe, having ordered the exact same dish at other, more competent locations. As if to add insult to injury, when I called and spoke to the manager about the aforementioned eggshell incident, he claimed over the phone that he would refund what I paid for that meal and that the money would go back onto my credit card. Guess what never happened. And... Guess who's never going back to this sucktastic poophole ever again. Thanks a lot for your disgusting food preparation and deceitful management. If someone from Pei Wei company corporate is reading this, please do yourself and your customers a favor and FIRE the manager running this joint.",0
"I used to be a huge Pei Wei fan, but the past few times we've gone there--especially last time-- I've been EXTREMELY disappointed. \nI go to Pei Wei for the spring rolls and the chicken lettuce wraps. We usually order for lunch, so their lunch combos were always great because they came with an eggroll or spring roll. But recently they've changed their menu so I ended up with Pei Wei Spicy Beef combo which, per usual, had chewy meat, not enough sauce and too much rice. I also ordered the Thai lettuce wraps and let me just say STAY AWAY FROM THESE! It was such a confusion of flavors.. it was tangy and there was the hint of cilantro and mint... MINT! Gross! My boss took one bite and almost puked, he's a bit picky so I tried it and almost puked as well. We also ordered the Steak Lettuce wrap which was gross too. Super disappointing. \nThis place is way too pricy and now that they've essentially eliminated the ONLY thing I like there... they can close up shop as far as I'm concerned.\nI'd prolly eat here again if it was thee LAST place open and McDonald's has exploded. But for now, if I never eat here again, it'll be too soon.",0
"Compared to other Pei Wei locations across the valley, this location is by far the worst. \n\nI've gotten takeout for lunch about five times, and each time has been worse than the last. Even after two of my coworkers ended up with violent food poisoning after eating the food here, it took finding an EGGSHELL with bits of raw egg in my Caramel Chicken to realize that something was seriously wrong with this joint. Not only was the food extraordinarily disgusting, as an added bonus, it contains pieces of kitchen garbage. \n\nWhen I called the manager to complain, he offered me a refund to my credit card over the phone, which never actually happened. \n\nThanks for the lies. Thanks for the disgusting food. And thanks for asking Yelp to take down my previous review.",0
"I used to like Pei Wei but something about their meat tastes different.  It does not taste right.  I tried it a few more times but haven't been back since and will definitely steer clear.  I told a manager right away and he made a new plate, but the new meat tasted just as strange.  I told him and the sweet fellow apologized although it was out of his control.  \n\n I hope this is not another case of quality suffering because of quantity.  Is it easier to buy from sloppy, poorly regulated slaughter houses and inject meat pieces with filler - creating a mystery meat that the masses will most likely still enjoy as long as there's a distracting sauce or glaze?",0
My 12 year old daughter and I just returned from this location and we both got very sick.  She had the orange chicken and me the Pad Thai w chicken.  Gross,0
I really like this Pei Wei. We always order online and then pick up the food at the restaurant. The take-out process is fast and easy and the staff are nice and friendly. The food is DELICIOUS! I have never actually eaten in the restaurant but it looks very clean and spacious.,1
manager Veronica delivers the best service. I ordered a dish that was too salty and she was courteous all the way and made sure I got a different dish. Thank you for the excellent service!,1
"This place is amazing. Been going to them for years! Always great food, could use some extra cleaning here and there for faster seating especially on busy nights but overall a great bang for your buck",1
I used to LOVE PEI WEI\nNO MORE to their positive they catered my business's X Mass party and it was great.\nBut on an individual dinner basis I have been disappointed. Also they are running a gift card special and have the signs almost hidden. I spent $170 for the office party wouldn't it have been nice for someone to point them out. Why have the offer and not promote it.????,0

"OK...so I like to have my shirts pressed and cleaned for the all important work day or business meeting, so I use to go to Maroney Cleaners which is right across the street from Viking Cleaners but I switched to Viking after Maroney lost a shirt and two of my ties after being a faithful customer for several years, I just didn't feel like they new how to run their business after they lost my $100.00 Tommy Bahama shirt.  In any so I switched to Viking across the street and in any event Viking does a top notch job on cleaning the only problem is that they are extremely pricey, and not very honest, I dropped off 12 shirts and asked the girl how much they would cost to get laundered...not dry cleaned just laundered..the girl at the counter explained that it would cost about $2.50 a shirt but some of them would have to be dry cleaned based on the material, I said how much is that she said it was the same as being laundered, I said OK then, So 12 shirts at 2.50 a shirt $25.00 bucks...so I am like OK see you tomm. so I come in to pick up my shirts and the bill is $45.50...I ask the same girl who now has a huge hickey on the side of her neck...not very professional to say the least. She says oh well pants cost $5.00 to be pressed. I said I don't have any pants, she looks confused and then after reviewing my receipt she explains that two of my shirts need special cleaning and that cost extra and 5 of them had to needed to be dry cleaned which is $4.10 a shirt. to say the least I was peeved. And explained to them that I specifically asked the price when I left them to get cleaned...the girl was like I don't know who you talked to. I said it was you, which she denied ever saying that she quoted me the $2.50 price for dry cleaning which at this point I was furious and explained that I would never come back.  So they do a great job at cleaning but their staff is dishonest and unprofessional...Use at your own risk.",0
Won't come back here... These people are incompetent... Over two weeks for alterations that still haven't been done.. Made me wait Despite coming before a regular.... I'll give one star because at least the lady was nice,0
$3.79 for the small blizzard. Really??! \n\nI laughed when I saw the size as I picked it up through the drive-thru. I guess it's just been a long time since I've had a blizzard. \n\nDang! Guess I won't be getting one of those again for a while. (Which is probably a good thing.),0
"I LOVE DAIRY QUEEN!\n\nWell, mostly their blizzards! I went and was very surprised that you buy one get a blizzard free of the same size or smaller. This definitely made me happy :D\n\nMy favorite is their oreo blizzards! That's what I usually get although their strawberry cheesequake blizzard and hawaiian blizzard is also yummy!",1
"I'm sure you have heard those stories from your parents or grandparents of how back in the old days they walked to school five miles in a raging snowstorm. Well I seem to remember back in the old days when I was a kid when Dairy Queen was a treat and the ice cream was so good. Way better than that stuff you get at the grocery store. Sometimes we would buy the quarts of ice cream to bring home.\n\nSo I snuck out of the office about 3pm and drove above 5 miles to the Drive Thru. This car in front of me must have ordered about a week's worth of burgers, because based on Rand's review these are the best burgers ever. It probably took about ten minutes of waiting at the Drive Thru and all I wanted was a large vanilla ice cream cone. I should have gone inside. Who would have thought the people in front of me ordered about $100 dollars worth of food.\n\nWhen I finally got to taste the ice cream cone I thought to myself, what a let down. It was not any better than a Mickey Dee cone. It certainly didn't taste like it was a premium type ice cream like in the good old days. Next time I'll just get a burger.",0
"This location is convenient and that is why I gave it 1 star. Honestly every time I go here my order is wrong. I have come to the point where I make them repeat it back to me and they still mess the order up. I've even Gone to the point at the window to ask them if my order is correct they say \""""yes of course\"""" I will get it and check it and it's wrong. I understand it gets busy but that doesn't mean serve your customer whatever the hell you want. I have allergies to foods and if it wasn't for me checking everything I eat DQ may have landed me in the ER more then once.",0
If you are having a bad day.. get a blizzard.\nIt is great.. nothing else makes me as happy as this.,1
"Terrible customer service! \n\nI was in the market for two Electra cruisers (total cost w/accessories $1000). Since I lived down the street I thought it would be convenient to have a bike shop so close by. On three separate occasions, I went in the Bike Barn:\n\n1.  Monday afternoon - was in the store over 20 minutes - nobody every spoke to me or offered any assistance.\n\n2.  Thursday afternoon - a young gentlemen approached me, started asking some questions about the cruisers, he pulled out his cell phone and started sending a text message\n\n3.  Sat morning - was approached by a middle aged woman, told her I was interested in the Electra's - pointed me to the opposite side of the store and then walked off.\n\nGreat location - crappy customer service.",0
"Terrible customer service; I've been a handful of times and get ignored or feel as though I'm inconveniencing the staff. It's also comparatively overpriced. Go to Rage Bikes in Scottsdale, for the total opposite of my comments above.",0
"Worst Bike Shop EVER!\nAfter being assured by the staff at \""""Bike Barn\"""" in Phoenix that they do ship recumbents and could pack ship the Bacchetta Strada plus some extra components to me for $60 plus shipping via Fed Ex to me here in San Francisco, I bought a bike from someone on Craigslist .  I then never heard from Bike Barn after they got my bike delivered to them with my information.  I called two days later and the Manager then told me that the guy who confirmed with me was new and they don't really do that for $60, it should be more, but they would figure something out when they get a box, but acted like they were gonna charge me more than they quoted.  Then the ASS. Manager called me a day later and said they were going to pack it all in a huge 7foot box and had determined with FedEx that it was gonna cost me $441 to San Francisco!  They gave me some attitude when I said that was utterly ridiculous, given that I shipped a trike from Florida to San Francisco for $150 total.  I could fly there, pick it up and fly it back for less!  They were unsympathetic and downright unhelpful when I suggested they pack it in two boxes and they just actually suggested I ship it via truck!  I then called Sun Cyclery (Bike Barn got a box from them) as I was clearly SOL with the knuckleheads at BB.\n\nThe difference in attitude and service was dramatic and amazing!  Joe at Sun Cyclery was friendly, polite and knowledgeable and said he had just shipped something similar to my bike for a LOT less than $441!  He explained that Bike Barn SHOULD KNOW BETTER than to ship it all in one gigantic box and that two boxes were required to keep it within FedEx shipping Requirements.  Joe went over and picked up the bike (after Bike Barn refused to drive it the 6 mi.)  He packed it and shipped it four days earlier than promised and for $227 total!  Not $501 total!\n\nJoe packed it securely using old inner tubes, which were inflated inside the box to keep it all snug and secure!  Creative attention to detail, friendly, polite and platinum quality service is what you get from Sun.  Avoid Bike Barn at all costs!  Go to Sun!",0
"Chuck and Ryan, rude, Chuck dropped my bike off the rack. NEVER going back. Mary was nice, I'll take my bikes to somewhere that knows what customer service is",0
"I'm going to start off with saying, I think Bike Barn deserves some of the reviews it has gotten here. I've bought 4 bikes from them in the last year, so I have run the gamut on what they have to offer. The guys who helped me with my first three bikes, were approachable relatively friendly but did what no salesman should do. \""""It's good for its price range.\"""" \n\nREALLY because I thought it was what I could afford.  To be fair Landis cycling said the same thing to me. I guess it's in the bike salesman book on how to win and influence customers............ So yeah, bike guys, stop saying that. It pisses your customers off.  With that off my chest, I can tell you why to go in there. Her name is Mary. She is amazing and has earned my business until she leaves Bike Barn. ASK FOR HER. She knew her inventory, had no problem answering my questions and fitted me for a bike that works for me. I even gave her many options some of them definitely more expensive and yet she persisted in making sure I got the right bike for me. That's impressive in my book. Try not to lose her bike Barn and get her to train the guys, they need something.\n\n PS I shopped a lot of bike places, there prices were comparable if not slightly cheaper than other places. I have no idea why anyone would think this particular store is more expensive.....Maybe to Wal-mart?",1
"Customer service is shocking and I don't know how they've stayed in business.  I'm just getting into cycling for the first time since I was a kid, and should have checked this site before purchasing at the Bike Barn.  When I told the salesman that I was 'new' to modern cycling, his response was 'go borrow somebody else's bike'.  Way to get people into cycling and keep customers, eh?  I had already made the trip out there and purchased although shouldn't have - I truly wish another shop got my money.  He never offered to fit (which I later realized was very important)  or even ask my height, riding style, etc which has cost me some pretty stiff joints and a trip to the chiropractor.  I had to ask all the questions - he could care less.  When he was putting on some add-ons, I asked if I could watch and his response was to turn his back to me and completely covered what he was doing.   I'm sorry, Mr. Personality - I am new, trying to learn and tried to be a customer!  \n\nOn my first ride I realized that the brakes were not assembled correctly and had to take it to another shop to get them fixed - I couldn't stomach taking it back even though it was brand new.  I just took it in for its 'free tune up' and they were jerks then, too.  I picked it up (or rescued it, rather) tonight and they man who returned it was nice - I'll give him that, but short of Bike Barn being the only bunker during a nuclear fallout, I'll never return.   Better customer service can be found at the motor vehicle division in August.  They say that a person will tell 50 people about a bad experience, and here it is, as seen on Yahoo and Facebook as well.    Maybe they only like seasoned riders.  If you're not, save yourself the high blood pressure and go to any other store.",0
"I grew up in the Bike Barn neighborhood so I have loyal affinity for business in that area.  I was selling a carbon fiber bike and wanted to have it tip top for the new buyer so I took the bike in.  It was $60 for a service so I said \""""OK.\""""\nThen he points out my flat tires and says I need new ones so I agree again and now we are up to $150.  I am driving home and he calls and says, \""""Hey man your rims are cracked and ready for failure.\""""  He goes on with the punchline, \""""I would not risk my life on these rims.\"""" He says the cost for replacement rims would be $450.  I say OK and am smarting at the thought of $600 just to tune the bike up for sale?  Something about the cost of the rims made me look on Ebay and I found many choices of cool rims for the $200 range.  I called back and cancelled the rim purchase and instructed them to put my old rims on. When I picked up the bike which looked good with a clean up and new tires, I asked how much to crate a bike with me paying the postage?  The reply was $60 and after posting the bike on EBay it was quickly sold.  I called back and Ryan answered and I asked how much to crate a bike for shipment he replied $100.  I explained I was in and the price was $60 so he says, \""""OK if they told you $60 then it is $60.  I took the bike to REI and they said it would be a couple of days but the cost would be $30.  REI actually had the bike ready the next day for $30! My last experience with Bike Barn was when I took a bike wheel which was flat and wanted it repaired. I thought I would give it one more chance.  It was slow so the guy said he would do it right away. He removed the old tube and was putting in a new tube when I asked, \""""Can't you patch the old tube?\""""  His reply with steely eyed arrogance was \""""I don't do patches.\""""  \nIn my opinion most of the staff with exception of the woman thinks they are way too cool.  I don't know where the arrogance comes from but it usually filters from above.  Don't be fooled into thinking this is a cute, friendly, neighborhood bike hang out offering fair prices because it is not.  It is a BUYER BEWARE atmosphere with salespeople looking to take your wallet for a ride.",0
"These 4 stars actually belong to Mary, the manager.  While I ended up not buying my road bike from this store due to the deep discount I received from another LBS for the same brand road bike at an upgrade level, I wanted to share with you that Mary is awesome, patient, and very helpful.  I would recommend her to novice women bikers. \n \n I'm very particular about purchasing merchandise from women, as I am a huge proponent of supporting women's business enterprise and supporting women in general. \n\nMary spent a bunch of time figuring out the right bike size for me, and searched the computer to find out the availability and prices for 2012 models. She made me feel very comfortable and educated me on bikes and riding.  She rocks.",1
"I really wanted to like this place.  Since I moved to Phoenix I have been looking for a nearby local bike shop.  Bike Barn is right around the corner from my office.  It seems like the tendency is for anybody that deals in specialized goods is to become really cliquish.  As you can see from looking at the reviews under \""""bicycle shop\"""" it is definitely something that goes on a lot with bicycles.  When I  first started looking for a shop I took some time off and went to 5 in a row.  I would go into the shop and look at their stuff.  No one said anything to me in the first 4 shops.  That seems to be typical of bike shops in Phoenix.  If you aren't in the club they don't have time for you.  I suppose it doesn't help that I am not young, pretty and particularly fit, but when I was all three I raced bikes, worked in a bike shop, and lived the life for years so apparently I have unrealistic ideas about what service can/should be.\n\nUnfortunately Bike Barn is a typical Phoenix shop.  I have gone twice.  The first time I talked to a semi-informed unfriendly mechanic .  The second time I sought help in getting the right fit on my bike (with an appointment paying for the time, mind) and it was clear that the person had better things to do.  Don't know what, the store was empty.\n\nSo...if you are part of the club, or the staff is having a good day...good for you.  I won't be back.",0
"I had been going to this shop for years, but I'm done.  Prices for basic repairs are way over priced and this last time I took one of my bike in they could not fix it and they still wanted to charge me for it!!!!    Then I come home and fix it myself in 30 min!   ---Go to Landis and not this place.",0
"The selection of bikes and accessories here is pretty good, but the service was terrible. These were the most unfriendly, annoyed, least helpful people I've ever experienced at a bike shop. They were annoyed that we got there 20 minutes before closing and practically shooed us out the door promptly at 5 'til. We rode our bikes there and bought a basket for my cruiser (and a couple other things) and asked them if they had a tool we could use to put it on real quick. They said \""""maybe if you got here 25 minutes earlier we could help you.\"""" I mean, I get it, you're closing, but you don't have to be so rude. It would probably have taken you five minutes to put it on since you probably do that exact thing about 5 times a day. Plus, we have been to a lot of bike shops and they are usually the most friendly people, willing to stay an extra few minutes to earn your business. We've spent thousands of dollars at other bike shops and we won't be going to this one again, even though it's just blocks from our house.",0
"Never even been here... I was shopping for a bike at Landis and asked the wifey to go outside and call BB to price shop a similar bike... She was shocked when she came back at how rude the guy was on the phone, saying that if we didn't have at least $2k to spend on a entry level full suspension mountain bike that we'd be wasting our time... No worries, I bought a badass $2k Specialized upgraded to the 9's... Not BB's \""""entry level\""""... And all of this could have been avoided with a little customer service...",0
"Definitely a mixed review for me. I am a total newbie to biking, and my first call was taken by a female who was so helpful and patient with all my questions. I decided that I would definitely bring my bike and my husband's bike in for what we needed. The next day I called to ask how long the service would take, and I spoke with a guy who was a  rude jerk. I didn't want to take the chance that he would take care of  me when I brought my bikes in, so I went to another bike shop near by where EVERYONE was nice and helpful.",0
"We purchased a child seat for the back of our bike that was on display in their store and brought our bike in to have it put on.  After loudly complaining about how hard it may be to install, they told me it would be 5 days.  I left the bike and said not a problem.  Happily they called 2 days later.  The child seat they put on was not the same child seat in the store.  When I questioned them about it, they stated that it was the same seat just a different model.  I said it looks quite different as the bar does not go over the head and the foot rests are not adjustable.  They stated that it was the same quality/same seat but just a different model.  I took the bike home and my kid loves it.  After we took our first ride I did a little research.  Come to find out that the seat they put on is the cheaper version that is not as safe or strong as the one I requested and thought I was getting.  The non caring and looking at me as if I was wrong when I questioned the bike seat was not necessary and I nor my family (with 2 young kids that will be getting many new bikes over the next 10 years) will never be back.\n\nIf you are putting a different product than purchased it should be told to the customer and they should not be shamed when asking about it.",0
"After buying a vintage bike to restore for my girlfriend and on a recommendation from a co-worker, I decided to give Bike Barn a shot. Rich, one of the mechanics helped me get some bearings for the headset because one of them was completely rotted! Luckily one of the original ones was still in great condition. I told him I'd like to replace both since I'm re-doing the bike. He said he didn't have those exact ones but had some that will work perfectly. He went to the back & picked out new bearings... Got home and nowhere near close to fitting! Asked him some more questions about other pieces I'd need. He seemed completely annoyed at the questions I'd ask & just working there in general. Seems like he just wants to get through the day just to get to the cold brewskis in the fridge at home. The guy with the buzzed head & lady that work at Bike Barn are super nice. Unfortunately, by my first interaction here I will not be going to Bike Barn any longer I'll take my money over to Landis Cyclery.",0
"Great service, great selection! My husband and I both got bikes here, we could've got them somewhere else, but the people here were so nice, that we came back and had them order the bikes for us. Plus they gave us a discount since we bought two bikes. They built my bike in just a couple hours for me, and I LOVE IT! So glad we found this place on yelp!",1
"I adore the employees that work here. They are incredibly helpful and chipper. I was sold on their incredible customer service when they pumped air into a knee scooter for me. (No charge! Happened right away!) \n\nRecently I dropped off a bike to be assembled and serviced. Actually, that's not true. Hamilton, my bud, carried the ginormous box from my car into the store. (Hey, I held the door open!) I explained that Bee (my yellow bike) had been accumulating dust back east for years and had a flat tire. I was pleased to hear how fairly priced the work c/would be. (They would examine my bike and ring me with a final course of action before starting the work.)\n\nAdditionally, with no judgement over my lack of exercise, Hamilton explained how the green goop sealant works. (My technical term. I heard \""""mwah mwah mwah\"""" but now understand what to do if I have a flat.)\n\nMy bike was ready in a few days ... and is now sitting unused in my apartment. \n\nEr-\n\nFocusing on the important stuff, this joint is great!",1
Brought my bike in to get it repaired and left with both tires flat told that they are dry rotted even though they are less than 2 months old.  I don't believe that my bike was stored in the correct way.  I recommend fixing your bike yourself if you have the tools or the ability which I should have done in the first place I guess,0
"I had experienced first hand why it's not a good idea to slide down a banister drunk, and cracked the crystal on my favorite watch. After finally getting around to getting it fixed, I contacted The Watch Repair Company:\n\n12/12/09: I call the shop asking about a price quote and ETA on when it would be fixed. I'm told it would be $20, and it would be finished Wednesday (12/16/09).\n\n12/23/09: Almost a week after I was told the watch would be fixed I call the shop. I am told that the watch is not finished but it would be the next day (12/24/09, a.k.a. Christmas Eve). Surprised that he would work on Christmas Eve, I am told the watch would be ready between 1-2pm. \n\n12/24/09 3:01 PM: I call the shop, and am told that he just needs to get the watch put back together but it would be ready by 4:30. Frustrated I let him know I would be there at that time.\n\nAfter The Watch Repair Company had fallen through twice, I was starting to get pretty frustrated with their complete lack of contact or clarity on when my watch would be fixed. The only guy that runs this place is almost completely impossible to understand, mumbling  in sort of a primitive way. No matter, I was especially excited to have my watch back.\n\n12/24/09 4:30 PM: I walk into the shop and let him know I am there to pick up my watch. He pulls it out of a sleeve mumbling \""""I got it cleared on out, I can give you a call when the crystal comes in,\"""" and hands me the same exact thing I had given him two weeks ago. The crystal was still cracked. After all that, nothing had been done. I am completely speechless, grab the watch, and head for the door. He mumbles \""""There's no charge on that.\""""\n\nI still have no Idea what to say. What a complete waste of time. I have absolutely no idea how this place is still in business.",0
"My new watch needed to have its metal-link bracelet resized and after a frustrating search (\""""We'll do it only if the watch was bought here\"""" ... \""""We don't have the right tools for that kind of bracelet\"""" ...), it occurred to me that I should have yelped it first! So after reading the more recent reviews for the establishment under new management (the 1st review is no longer valid - it was for the previous management; I'm waiting for yelp to take it down), I brought my watch here. Eddie was friendly, fast, and got the bracelet resized within a few minutes, for just 5 bucks. Now I know where to bring my watch for battery replacement, or if it ever needs repair in the future.",1
"After busting out every tool I could find from the toolbox and trying for 30 minutes to remove a watch link, I gave up.\n\nLuckily, the watch guy was able to remove it in under a minute for $5. He also replaces batteries for the same.\n\nHe's cash only and not open on weekends.",1
"I tried. \n\nI really did. I really wanted this to be \""""my watch guy\"""" for repair and servicing.\n\nAfter reading all of the amazing reviews about 'The Watch Repair Company' I decided to bring in a few of my old watches with the hope of giving them new life. I brought in older Seiko chronograph that needed a battery, cleaning, and some scratches buffed out. I also brought my Skagen World GMT watch that needed a crown replacement, battery, and cleaning along with my Vostok-Europe Anchar that needed the rotating bezel pin replaced or fixed (to keep the bezel from falling off).\n\nI was certain this was going to be the beginning of a wonderful business relationship. After all, the owner is Russian, one of my watches is Russian, and I even spent some time in Russia, so I knew a little about Russian watches and culture. Gosh this would be great I thought. \n\nBoy was I wrong. \n\nStrike One: \nAfter dropping off the Seiko and Skagen for what I thought would be a pretty quick fix and clean up (the owner tells me this), I get a call a week later stating that the Seiko is ready but he would need more time to fix the crown on the Skagen. \n\n\""""Ok, sure. Let me know when it is ready.\"""" \n\nNo worries right? I'm not in THAT desperate of a rush to get the watches back. I can wait. About five days after that, he calls me to inform me that the Skagen is ready with the Seiko for pickup. \n\n\""""Bring cash, I don't take Visa.\""""\n\nSure. No problem. His business, his rules. I get it. Well, I pick up the Seiko and Skagen to see that yes, they are fixed, but he did not clean or polish them AT ALL and they were both really dirty still. \n\n\""""Maybe he just got busy and forgot?\"""" \n\nAnyway, while I'm waiting to pick them up there were also several other people (shady looking folks selling gold, and selling it FAST) making deals with him so I felt like mentioning it my \""""cleaning problem\"""" would not have not warranted a good response at that moment. So I figured I would mention it another time, or just clean them myself as I am more than capable. No biggie. \n\nStrike two: \nA few days later I I decide to give him another go as he mentioned to me that he was an expert in Russian watches. So in good faith (once again) I bring him my Vostok-Europe Anchar, and ask him to fix the bezel. he gives me a \""""range\"""" for a price and so I drop it off. He wasn't sure if he had the parts and said he may have to send it \""""to a friend\"""" to get it fixed. \n\n\""""Ok. Just let me know when it's ready\"""". \n\nA couple days later he calls me to tell me that maybe I need to call the distributer (only a couple in the U.S) and have the parts paid for, and shipped out here so he can fix it. So to recap, a Russian watch \""""expert\"""" who is now asking me to do the leg work and get the parts needed to repair the watch. Hmmm. At this point I decide not to invest any more time into this, as I can now see where this whole thing is going. I decline politely opting to send the watch to RI for repair instead.  \n\nStrike three: \nA few days after the Vostok fiasco I somehow rationalize with myself that the reason he couldn't fix it was because of the rarity of the watch itself and that i should just stick to \""""easier\"""" repairs for him. \n\n\""""Man, I'm trying so hard to give this guy my business it is unreal\"""" -This what I was thinking at this point. \n\nI give him a call and ask about crystal replacement for my Skagen. Why not? Surely he's got this under control right? \n\n\""""Yes, bring it in. I replace with same crystal, $30.00 cash\"""". \n\n\""""Great. See you Thursday\""""! \n\nNot so great when I visit him though. He takes one look at it and tells me he cannot fix it because the crystal is \""""too big\"""". Mind you, he had an extensive amount of time with this watch (I presume) because he had it for close to two weeks when he repaired it the first time. Ugh. \n\nHere is the deal. I am patience to my own detriment sometimes, I am aware of this. Therefore sometimes I get treated a little poorer by businesses that think I won't do or say anything. I get it. But I really wanted this to by \""""my watch guy\"""" and I was trying so hard to give him my business even after he fell through twice on his end. What else could I do? \n\nHere is my actual evaluation of his operation:\n\nGot a quartz watch in need of battery? \nSee this guy. \n\nGot ANYTHING of value that you want back in a specific time frame? \nGo to an AD. \n\nGot a watch over $100 with repairs needed? \nGo to another shop or send it off to an AD or highly recommended place. \n\nGot gold for sell? \nSee this guy for quick cash (it seemed like a popular choice when I was there). \n\nSorry, I tried. Guess I'll have to take my business elsewhere. \n\nOne other quick note. The whole \""""desperate people selling gold and ONLY dealing in cash\"""" made me think that this guy's operation of watch repair may be a front for his other dealings. Not saying I care, just saying it came across like that to me as I was waiting for my watches.",0

He was like that is not a policy but I know it is in any event pizza hut is the most expensive pizza delivery place so I payed like $24.00 for cold food.\n\nDid you know that the drivers only get .97 cents out of that $2.50 delivery fee...sucks for them I usually tip fat...this guy got my change!!!\n\nThis sucked I am going to see if I can get another place to deliver to me.!!,0

"Pros: Consistent quality. I like the pepperoni pizzone and my sister likes the Hershey chocolate sticks. \n\nCons: Why would I bother to place my order online hours in advance, if its not going to be ready when I arrive? They didn't even start making it till I got here. Additionally, they got my order wrong! Scary neighborhood and parking lot full. I had to park in the shopping complex next to this one.",0
"We were on hold for OVER 10 minutes and then hung up on us. By the time we got to the place, they hung up on us!! Went in and they said a 50 minute wait AND said that there would be a $1 PER TOPPING charge which is NOT what it said on the online special!! This place is a rip off!!",0
Disappointed AGAIN! 3rd time in a row they have been 10 mins late and pizza has been warm. Not like the warm out of the oven but warm like sitting in a car. I used to order frequently but that will stop after these last visits.  Amazing that it takes an hour to deliver and I live 5 mins away.,0
"Took forever. Paper plates. No red pepper. Hair in my food. Phone rang off the hook. Dirty lobby and dinning room. Hmmmm, that seems like a fair assessment of what we had.",0
"I went here today for a basic oil change.  Service was good and I had no problems.  They did all of the initial \""""checks\"""" and whatnot and then they brought me out to go over the results.  My only issue here is that when they were recommending something, they just assumed you wanted to have it done and didn't ask.  I need a new air filter - they even brought it over to show me.  He just added it to my virtual \""""cart\"""" on their system.  I had to tell him that I didn't want to have it done right now.  He gave me the look like, \""""What are you thinking?  This needs to be done.\""""  No thanks, I'll do it myself.\n\nThe oil change was $34.95 and I had a $5 off coupon.  I was there on a Thursday and there was no $10 off deal so maybe that's a discount of the past...\n\nOverall, good times.  Minus one star for the attempted forced air filter and a waiting area that smells of urine.  Gross.",1
"I needed an oil change reeeeaaaally badly (i know, but i have a honda and those things can run on gas fumes for 30 miles and oil resin for months) and had had an OK experience at the danny's family on HIghland (free wash with a oil change, who doesn't love that?)\n\nBut. I checked the Danny's site and saw no promotion of the wash and didn't want to drive out of my way for nothing. i checked yelp and this Jiffy Lube had the best rating i could expect for an oil change place and was up the road from work. Downloaded the coupon (thanks for the tip, Kym) and was on my way.\n\nPull in and i tell the guy i want the \""""Signature\"""" change which includes window wash and floor vacuum, mentioning my $5 off coupon. He said that they were already running a special that was $13 off the $35 price so i said a-ok, cowboy. \n\ni wait for about 8-10 minutes in the small waiting room (bonus for having a Phoenix Magazine in the stack of Muscle Car Monthly, Oil Today and Antennas Weekly - look, just because i'm getting routine maintenance on my car does not mean i'm INTO cars).\n\nI get pulled into the garage area for the \""""spiel\"""" everybody dreads but it was surprisingly short and non-pushy. (i'm glad they don't drag you over to your engine anymore, that's totally lame). i do have to note that he tried to tell me my right front blinker, my left back blinker and my license plate lights were out. i had JUST gone to Checker to replace my left front blinker light and went through some extensive light checking and so found this news odd. i kept saying as much, and he kept insisting and i was about to ask to see for myself when he calls out to another worker \""""Hey, was that the honda with the lights or the jeep?\"""" the other guy says \""""the jeep.\"""" however, there was no other car in the place. hmmmmmmmm.\n\nOK, so i pay up ($24 altogether with a tax or fee or something added in) and go back into the waiting area while they finish up. I decide to use the bathroom -- and this is where the they lost two stars (this was, up until then, quite possibly a four-star experience - wait, two stars for a bathroom, you ask? oh, you just wait...)\n\nthe bathroom was filthiest thing i have seen in my life, and i've been to some raunch truck stop pee holes. literally, piss, in the bowl... i get in closer and i shit you not (pun intended) four shit smears in the bowl as well (yeah, i counted). two rolls of TP hanging out on top of the dispenser, each with one square left on them. realizing i need to sterilize my hands from just walking into this mess, i discover no soap or paper towels (not very surprising). as well, hair clippings all over the sink, like the guys are trimming their moustaches on their break. un-freaking-believable. i am still haunted by this bathroom experience.\n\nbut car's running great!",0
"I was at 3K since my last oil change and I knew I had driven past this place a few times (I'm new to the area).\n\nSo I drive up and dude is  all in my face asking if I want the signature service and he goes on to explain it and I ask how much it is and he says 37.99.  I say I just want an oil change and he says it will still be 37.99.  I then say well I think I'll just go somewhere else that's pretty expensive.  He says how about  $10 off and I agree.\n\nThey do their thing.  The guy brings me out to go over everything.  Your right lisence plate light is out do you want that fixed?  No.  Your wipers are looking pretty bad do you want us to replace those?  No.  We have this fuel cleaning blah blah?  No.  We tested your battery and you need a new batter.  How much is that?  $106.  Not at this time.  Your air filter looks ok do you want a new one?  No.  Do you want premium, high temp oil?  No just regular oil.  We recommend getting your tired rotated ever 2 oild changes do you want that?  No.  We recommend getting transmission fluid flush every 30k miles do you want that?  No..... \n\nOh then I'm driving on the highway and they didn't close my hood all the way tight so I had to pull off and slam it.\n\nI just wanted a simple oil change and left alone.  I like when I can stay in the car and be out of there in 5 minutes not a sales pitch.",0
"Do not go here!  I support Jiffy Lube like you would not believe but I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO NOT GO HERE (NOT THIS JIFFY LUBE)!!!\n\nThey purposely damaged my tire to spite me!!!\n\nYesterday morning, when I got an oil change, I was encouraged to upgrade to a higher quality oil - I declined.  When I was encouraged to change my air filer - I declined.  When I was encouraged to change my cabin air filer - I also declined.  It came to a point of forced upgrades where I literally said, \""""I just want an oil change and I have to go.\""""\n\nThis morning I noticed my front tire was WAY low of air (they checked it yesterday).  I filled it asap but noticed air seeping uncontrollably through the valve.  I took to to a Goodyear (on Indian School) and they said, \""""The only way this can happen is if someone loosens it.  There is no way it can come unloose by itself. The pressure is too high.\""""  They even asked if I, \""""...had any enemies.\""""  When I told them, \""""No, but I did get an oil change yesterday at the Jiffy Lube on 32nd they replied, \""""This isn't the first time dude.  About once every few months someone comes in with this issue from that Jiffy Lube.\""""\n\nEnough said.\n\nI know corporate people at Shell Oil and jiffy Lube.  They are great people and they have supported my business.  I will always support Jiffy Lube but never (again) this franchise or their staff.  They put my family's safety at risk for juvenile redemption because I would not buy an extra air filter.  \n\nDo not go here - ever!\n\nP.S. When I went I went down and confronted the staff - predictable results.  Ignorance = minimum wage with poor management.",0
"I drive a mini and usually go to the MINI dealership but couldn't get in and I REALLY needed an oil change. They said they had to check to see if they carried the correct oil filter before they would tell me that they could do the oil change. They checked on the computer but didn't think to check the physical inventory. So after I was given the green light and all the oil was drained out of my MINI....here comes the guy to tell me that the oil filter in stock is defective! He apologizes over and over and says that they are getting another one delivered from another store, but that they are backed up. So now what was to be a 10 minute oil change as the guy said....had now turned into over an hour oil change. To top things off...the oil filter that was delivered from the other store DIDN'T FIT!!! Granted the guy didn't charge me for the oil change, but if the customer service would have been a little more on point I wouldn't still have to go to the dealership for my oil filter!! No more Jiffy Lube for this girl!",0
"It called beforehand and spoke to Don and informed him that I had to 25.95 coupon. and I would be right in When I arrived I spoke to Don again and mentioned the coupon again and he told me to hold on to it until when he calls me in to pay. He called me in to talk to me and tell me what needed to be fixed on the car, basically the upsell and I am okay with that because I generally do my own work and don't pay 15.00 for an air filter I can get at target for 1/5 of their price but I do understand what they are doing. Again I tried to present the coupon and he told me to hold on to. When he was done he gave me the total and it was $40.04, far from the $25.95 I was expecting. When I questioned him his reply was \"""" I asked you if you wanted Valvoline oil and you said yes\"""" I don't remember him asking him but here is what they did to me and you need to watch out if you come in with a coupon. Even though he knew I had the coupon which stipulated it had to be Shell oil he deliberately asked me if I wanted Valvoline oil. If he had asked me, \"""" the coupon is for Shell oil, would you prefer valvoline\"""" then I would have had the option to choose, not be duped into accepting something that was not part of the coupon. This is how they got around honoring the coupon. Very unethical way to do business and I intend on reaching out to Jiffy Lube corporate and see what their answer is. \n\nThis is the second time I used jiffy lube and both times have been a bad experience and looking at reviews, I guess I am not the only one who questions their practices. Obviously I won't be coming back here and I suggest you don't go there either.",0
"I came here for an oil change after not being able to make it in time for another Jiffy Lube location nearby and felt as though I was of inconvenience to the employee that \""""greeted\"""" me there.  I got here about 30 min to closing, and as I am pulling up the \""""greeter\"""" raises up his arms as in frustration and immediately tells me its a \""""45 minute wait,\"""" which I was ok with.  He tells me quickly after, it'll be more like an \""""hour wait\"""" which was still OK with me.  I did not feel quite welcome, although he did give me the usual welcome routine, \""""there's the coffee, the bathroom, if you need anything... Etc.\"""" which did not feel genuine.  I would certainly not come back to this location for the unwelcoming environment.",0
They responded to their phones promptly. \nThey checked what was necessary in my car.\nThey answered all my questions in regards to mai,1
Slowest service ever. Sat in the waiting room for 25 minutes while four guys stood around the single car in the entire shop. After finally asking for the keys it's been another 20+ minutes and still waiting. So almost fifty minutes and counting for a simple oil change with only one other customer. There is simply nothing jiffy about this place.,0
"Very pleased with these guys!  Locked ourselves out of the house & gave them a call.  They are just down the street so they arrived within 5 minutes of the call. He had us back in our house in no time.  The locksmith that helped us out was very polite and knowledgeable.  He even showed us we have a programmable doorknob, who knew?!!",1
"The man that did my locks was extremely unpleasant.   He acted like he did not want to be there and talked to me like I was stupid.  I can't stand that people that are that mean n miserable are dealing with the public.   There was another man that I got the time before who was very personable and really sweet.  So he's great.  But this guy working nights that's on call ,,, you don't want to get him.",0
"We live about 200 miles from Phoenix and do not have a Fertility Center in our area. My wife and I went to Dr. Gounala after a very bad experience with another fertility center in Phoenix. She and her staff seemed very caring and nice, she recommended that we have IVF with ICSI to improve our chances of conceiving. We were prepared to do this and everything seemed to be on course until they found that my Health Insurance would pay for some of the tests (Semen Analysis, Blood Work etc..) related to infertility. Then things changed. Dr. Gounala said that there were many \""""PROBLEMS\"""" we had to make trips to Phoenix about once or twice a week for a Semen Analysis or Blood Work? this went on for almost a 2 year period!! Before we were just about ready to give up we were refferred to a doctor in Tucson (which is about 300 miles from where we live) We scheduled an appointment and from the time we met with him until we were pregnant was a total of 4 MONTHS. He did not do a single semen analysis and very few tests on my wife. we now have a beautiful 2 month old baby girl... And did I mention the price was 50% of what SW fertility was going to charge us?? I would be very cautious of these fertility centers they are fully aware how despirate couples can be and how limited their options are....I have experienced it so I know they will use this to their advantage to bleed you dry!! IVF is enough of an emotional rollercoaster to go through with out having to worry about an unethical practice stringing you along to make some additional money....",0
"I will keep this short and sweet. I never even met the doctor. The office staff was the rudest experience i have ever had. I have called for the past month trying to get results with no luck. No one returns my calls and the girls on the phone are rude and not friendly at all. The doctor may be good but for me, it's about the whole experience and this was an awful one!!!!!",0

This is hands down my favorite antique shop. I've been to most of the shops in phoenix and this one always stands out to me. I always seem to find something that I have to have wether it be some old black and white photos or a bear rug! The staff is friendly and will help you find what your looking for if you require something specific. They will also call the booth owner if you would like to make an offer on a piece. Everything is reasonably priced for the most part and the content stays filtered. I mean I have nothing against people who collect toys and beetles memorabilia but I'm just glad that at this store I don't have to sift through it.  2 thumbs up for sure!,1
"This place can salvage a couple of stars from me because there are a couple of booths here with spiffy shit -- unusual, quirky, one-of-a-kind type stuff. \n\nThe major turnoff at this place was the godawful exorbitant prices. Like, I think I actually laughed out loud once after flipping over a price tag. That, and the confusing, choppy layout, along with the unsmiling staff who kept giving me the side eye as if I was going to stuff an item in my purse. Just UGH.\n\nNo thanks.",0
"As Megan D. said, the staff will make you feel like a criminal. I went in the store with my girlfriend and the first thing we asked the manager was if we could take pictures. We told her if it was an issue we would leave our cameras in the car. She told us it was fine and we were there for an hour snapping away and having a grand time. As we made our way to the front she tells me that I am clogging the aisle and that she needs to see my ID. She told me that security told her to take it. I then asked where the security people are located and she said that they had left. Further into the conversation she said that the manager told her to take it. I asked who the manager was and she said there was no manager and proceeded to say security had asked for it. I called her out on the inconsistency of the story and she said she never said that she told me that a manager asked her to take the information. One of the employees finally took me to the side while she was helping a customer and told me that she was the manager and was concerned I was casing the place to later rob it. She accused me of taking pictures of the security system and being too detailed with my shots. I'm a photographer and all I was looking for was nice pictures. I insisted that she watch as I deleted all photos that I took, but she said all she needed was my information. Needless to say, I will not be coming back to this antique store. The items are priced too high and many things are not even antiques. This experience ruined a rather fun day up to that point.",0
Great place to fine unique pieces of furniture. I bought 3 end tables and an english Edwardian desk from them and I'll go more and look for other stuff. The elegant lady with the short black hair in the front is very nice and she will do anything to help. Thank you !,1
Place way over priced,0
"Based on friendliness factor alone, I would love to give this place a glowing five-star recommendation. The husband and wife who own and operate Sushi Mishima handle your entire experience gracefully and could not be any nicer without being too nice. The wife acts as the waitress while the husband prepares all of the sushi. \n\nInitially, the menu was a little underwhelming. The Cali Rolls and Spicy Tuna rolls were about as exotic as it got. However, when we asked about specialty rolls, the response was, \""""What do you want?\"""" We ended up with a Philly roll, a Caterpillar roll and a Tootsie Roll, all made to order based on our requests. If you're not sure what is in a particular roll that you like, you might want to look up its ingredients before you head in so you can have it made exactly as you like it. I was impressed with their flexibility, but wasn't blown away by the quality. \n\nAll in all, this place is a great find. The rolls themselves are abnormally large, however, so it might be a good idea to order two at a time until you're full. Or just bring some doggie bags home.",1
"All I have to say is wow.  And this is my story...\n\nI had bought Le Mans brand tires from a Firestone store in Texas (I now live in Arizona).  When I needed a flat repaired caused by a nail, I called the local Firestone store.  I asked how much it would be since I had bought the tires from them and their reply was, \""""$25.86, unless you can give us the phone number that you had 5 years ago in Texas, that is the only way we can make it free.\""""  I then questioned him, \""""Isn't Le Mans a Firestone exclusive tire?\""""  He replied, \""""Yes it is.\""""  \n\nNow at this point I was just perplexed and all sorts of red flags were going off in my head.  I then let them know that it is ridiculous that Firestone is the only store that I could have bought the tires from and they won't fix the flat for free!  Needless to say, they also wanted $125 to read the fault codes off of my truck when your local auto parts store will do it for free!  \n\nAfter all of this drama, and the stress of trying to figure out why they had such a horrible policy, I called Discount Tire, because I would rather pay $25 to them than help keep Firestone in business.  They surprised me by saying, \""""We will fix it for free.\""""  I was completely shocked, and immediately gave them my tire, came back in an hour and they took it out to my truck and loaded it for me!  Thanks Discount Tire!  \n\nAnd I also had my wife's tires changed and they gave me a lower price since the tire I wanted was out and the next tire up from that would have cost $15/per tire extra!  Talk about 5 star customer service!",1
"Quick, friendly, awesome.",1
"Great customer service. Wasn't very crowded at 9am on Saturday. I'm a fan of BOTH of these things!! \n\nI was seriously in and then outta d'er in like 20-25 minutes for tire rotation, air and stuff.\n\nWhen the dude behind the counter suggested that the waiting clients were too quiet, I informed him that we were formulating an evil plot and possible hostile takeover...so, either they are very good-natured, or I don't look nearly as threatening as I was lead to believe by my little cousins, because no one did anything except chuckle.",1
"My husband and I have always bought our tires here.  We always get the warranty because crazy stuff just happens to us.  \n\nBut now I really love discount tire because this morning my tire blew at 5 am.  By the time the tow truck got the car to discount tire it was 7:15 - 7:30.  Even though they don't open until 8, the guys let me in to warm up (it was cold!) and took down my information.  Then they told me where I could get coffee and let me chill in their waiting area to stay warm (cause the Sonic doesn't have indoor seating) until my car was ready.  I didn't have to ask for any of that, they just did it, and that's why I'm a fan!!",1
"I had such a friendly, helpful supportive experience today!\nThey lent me a tire when I was in a pinch.",1
"Best deal on a full set of tires, and some of the most professional and quality service in the valley. Came highly recommended from a friend, glad we listened!",1
"Love this place. Not that it's fun to get tires repaired on a Saturday morning, but this is the best place to do it. The people here are very friendly. I bought tires here a year ago and have been in twice in the past few months after randomly running nails. They fix everything quickly. I think you also get free lifetime rotations if you buy tires from them.",1
"A few days ago, my 370Z hit a nail and needed to get fixed. I called Firestone, they wanted $39, then Fletcher's and they wanted $14. Reasonable, but then at the last minute, I called Discount Tire. To my surprise, they offered to fix it for free. What!?  I was floored. So, I brought it in and saw that their business was booming. A nice line for free tire pressure checks while you wait in your car they check and fill...and with a smile (so I observed). They guys filling the tires greeted me outside and we're super courteous. Then I went inside and Jason was awesome. Gave me stats about my tires and facts about their health. I waited like 45 min in a cool room with cold water bottles and I even saw a wifi router. This place is the paramount of tire repair and sales shops for customer service...seriously.",1
The staff at this clinic are HORRIBLE. The receptionists ignore you. Dr. Clark's assistant did not wash her hands or wear gloves when giving me a shot. She even tried to wipe the blood away without protecting herself or me. Dr. Clark appears to be competent but basically he just sends you out to specialists since he can never see you when you are actually sick.,0
While dr Corcoran is nice and comforting getting into see one of the doctors is virtually impossible. I have never been able to get in to see a doctor or physicians assistant within48 hours and when you are sick that's essential. \nAdditionally the staff there act as if they are doing you a favor by taking your money. I have never witnessed such nonchalant behavior at a doctors office. Ridiculous,0
5 stars for the doctors but not happy about the 1-2+ hour wait time EVERY. SINGLE. VISIT. Finding a new doctor because of this unfortunately. So disappointing!,0
"Moving into 2015 and dealing with another insurance change. I always freak when this happens because I worry I will lose Dr Corcoran. But I am lucky and all is good. I have been seeing him for a few years now and it is still great. I have had the experience where things often start out fine, and then for what ever reason things sour over time. They can get you in pretty quick. If not with him a NP or another doctor if it is an emergency. I like that Dr. C takes the time to stop and look back in your chart and remind you it has been a while since this or that or whatever. No I don't think he is padding the bill I just think that since he is a DO and not a MD they are trained to think of things more in terms of the whole picture than just lets fix this one issue. He is easy to talk to. Really if I ever got horrible news you would be ok with it coming from him.... I know sounds weird but I have had so many doctors over the years who treat you like you are gum on their shoe or too stupid to live. With my chronic pain issues he is careful to work with my other doctors and keep them informed of any new issues. I kind of wonder sometimes why Dr. Corcoran decided to be \""""just a primary care doctor\"""" but I am glad he did.",1
"I'm a fan of Arby's because I enjoy their Reuben Sandwich and their Turkey Sandwich. It's a chill place with just the right A/C setting. I usually catch up on my reading during lunch so this place ticks all the right boxes in that regard.\n\nMy major gripe about this Arby's is in their haste to always upsell you they charge you more than what you order. I upgrade my drink size but it doesn't mean I want their gigantic curly fries. I finally had to read the riot act today and spell it out for them. Many years ago you would get a print out receipt of every item you ordered. These days you get the total you were charged on your credit card but you don't have any idea if you were charged correctly on each item.\n\nSo even though I still like you Arby's, I'm not ringing that bell.",1
"Of course driving by the name caught my attention, so why not!? After checking in with some adventerous friends, I noticed the placed lacked in reviews and thought I'd be the first, but leave it to those experienced Elite to lead the way! The place was small and lacked in an abundance of  love toys as the name implies, they did have plenty of cute outfits, and costumes ranging in sizes from small, super small to Xtra small and some  super high heels that would challenge even the most experienced of dancers! Prices seemed affordable for even the average \""""working girl\"""" , but don't worry guys they had costumes and colorful undercarriage for men too!

For that service alone I wouldn't write them off.",0
"brought the 4Runner in @ 2 on a Saturday, had it back @ 5:30. I knew the roters were warped, i needed an oil change, and I had a brake light out.

"I know the rating is low and part of it is undeserved. The people at Salon Sandoval are warm and welcoming and I have been happy with their services. They are an Aveda salon which is how I got their name. My stylist, Ruby, left there and then there seemed to be a ton of turnover. So, the reason for the rating? It's filthy. They honestly need to close for a week and have a deep cleaning, scrubbing, work it over. They also did a good job with my kids.",0
Shane is the BEST!  He makes me feel so beautiful and my hair is always perfect after he's finished!  I can't say enough good things about him...he really takes his time to ensure perfection!!!,1
"This was my first time going to this salon. I found a groupon for it and decided to try it out. When I first arrived I didn't really think much of it. The outside was just a normal looking store.

"I am really worried that my boyfriend and I will get nicknamed the Pu Pu Plater couple. That possibility be damned, the Pu Pu Plater is amazing. Fried shrimp, yes. Wontons, yes. Egg Rolls, yes. Beef Skewers, yes. HONEY DIPPED CHICKEN WINGS, OH HELL YES. Seriously these wings are so good. The skin is super crispy and coated in the most delicious sauce. The plater also comes with a confusing burner thing. We didn't know what we were supposed to do with it at first, but the last time we went the server put the Beed Skewers on there, so I guess that is what it is for. But the beef is already cooked so I am not sure why it is necessary. The hot and sour soup is awesome. The veggies in the soup are super fresh and delicious. The Egg Foo Yong is amazing as well.\n\nThe decor is very 80's: grey tones and tons of mirrors with the strangest bathrooms ever. The stalls clearly used to be showers and the it is creepily well lit. Blinding even. Very strong smell in the restrooms also, but it is pleasant, like laundry detergent. It is also giant inside and no one is ever there. It may be a front for an opium ring, but I don't care. Bring on the Pu Pu Plater!",1
This is my favorite chinese restaurant!  I go about twice and month and if I lived closer I would go more often.  Their mongolian beef is great!  Their lunch special is a great deal if you dine in.,1
"Absolutely typical mid-range Chinese fair. The Pu Pu platter that other reviews raved about was middle of the road, with the eggrolls at the low end and beef skewers a bit better than average.\n\nThe House Special Sesame Chicken was good, but nothing special, and a bit too sweet for my taste. The Moo Shu Pork was not bad at all, but was absolutely typical of the dish.\n\nIn general, it was slightly above average for typical Chinese food fair. Nothing special to remember the place, and there are a dozen others like it in town.\n\nAt 6pm on a Saturday night, we were the only table when seated, with two other tables being seated afterwards, but there were at least 5 phone calls for takeout while we were there, there was certainly nothing about the decor to recommend eating in versus takeout.",0
"It was Christmas Eve, and we were hungry so we followed some other cars turning into their parking lot.  We were the only Chinese people in there besides the staff.\n\nOMG, it was like a time warp back to when Chinese were cooking for Americans.  The decor was so eclectic, I can't even tell you what style it was.  Not real Chinese or pretend Chinese, not upscale or tattered.  You've got to see it for yourself (if you really want to know).\n\nI had to order a pupu platter which came with a flame and some sweet, sticky chicken wings, fried wontons, fried shrimps, beef on sticks, and shrimp toast (I think).  All the Chinese restaurants I go to in NY don't have it in their menu.  What can I say...fun and not too bad.\n\nThe fried duck was overcooked and dry.  The other things thing sauteed string beans and shrimp with sizzling rice were alright.  \n\nLet's just say it wasn't the best meal I ever had.",0
Just ordered food from here this evening for delivery. I have NO idea how this place gets 4 1/2 stars on here.  It was the worst chinese food I have ever eaten.  We ordered sesame chix which was soggy and gross. The eggrolls were overpriced and are more like a spring roll. the lomein is okay but will never get food from here again.,0
"We like to order from here for take out.  We usually get Moo Goo Gai Pan, Mongolian Chicken, and egg rolls.  They always get the order right.  It is nice to eat here too, there usually isn't a huge crowd for dinner (I'm not sure about lunch).  The decor isn't much to look at, but the food is very authentic and that is what I come here for. Very tasty.",1
"There are so many Asian restaurants, including the Chinese Cultural Center near by the office.  Little Shanghai has been by far the most consistent with the quality and customer service.  The delivery is super quick to our office (about 2 miles away), they never miss an order and the food is great.  I always get the Beef and Broccoli and the office usually splits a few orders of Pork, Vegetable or Chicken lo mein.  Very yummy stuff!\n\n2 years later, still great food and service!!!!!!!!!!",1
"Awwwe - I call this \""""the little unknown Chinese food treasure of PHX\"""" So good - cooked fresh, fresh ingredients and awesome staff. Doesn't look like much from the outside and inside is kinda plain and basic but the food is D'lish! I took some friends that didn't like Lo Mien, sweet and sour pork or fried rice - well now they like it! Don't forget to try the very healthy yummy Soup Fried rice :)",1
ordered food while at work not only did we get about food over an hour late  but i've had better frozen eggrolls than this place and the rice was terrible. Definately have had much better food in the valley.,0
"Decided to try on FRI 04MAY2012 - it was about 1:30PM and they close at 2PM; so, the expectations were not high; but, I was pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the combination noodle soup; I really enjoyed it; but only thing would be do not put in soy sauce in the soup; it was a little dark for me, also wished they had BBQ Pork in the soup also.  But, will be back!!!",1
"Ok.. First time I ordered from this place. I wanted to try something new. Sorry I did! Ordered some thing simple, Mongolian beef. I took a few bites and i was disgusted how raw the beef was. I don't mean med rare or rare. I mean raw! It was so unappetizing I just threw it in the trash. I can't find one redeeming quality about what I ate. Don't even get me started on the wife's entree and soup! Yuck! However, the egg roll was good! At least it was cooked! What was delivered to me was not even fit for the stray cat in the front yard!  Please... Read this.. I rarely criticize, but this was down right horrible! What a waste of money!",0
"Ordered the takeout combination special for four.  It was awful.  The chicken wings were raw, not just under cooked.  We stopped to  alert the management.  They refused to reverse the charges even though we dropped off their food to show them. The ridiculous reply was. \""""You bit into the wings, so no refund.\""""  Although we order take-out 3 to 4 times a week, we will never go back.",0
"I was skeptical after reading the negative reviews, but it's close so I decided to try it out. This place is amazing, no waiting, quick friendly service. The food is so good. I haven't tried everything on the menu, but what I have tried is delicious.  I highly recommend giving Little Shanghai a try.",1
"The shrimp fried rice and teriyaki chicken were good, but the rest of our order left a lot to be desired.  The crab puffs were missing a key ingredient....the crab!!!  That was really disappointing.  The beef and broccoli and cashew chicken didn't score high marks with our group.  Not sure we will give them another try.",0
"Since I was 8 years old I have been coming here. I am 24 now. That's sixteen years as a customer. We order about 4 times a year for the past few years.\n\nLet me detail some changes. Instead of serving their food in the take out boxes many people associate with Chinese they changed this procedure about a year ago. Now they come on cheap plastic plates with a top that can be sealed. Why does this matter? The volume of food you get in these plates is less than what it used to be. So I let that go, I kept ordering. My orders usually end up about 45-50 bucks.\n\nYesterday, I had my worst service and food that I have ever received. I MADE a yelp account because I am so pissed off. The Teriyaki chicken was hard, rock hard. It tasted like 2 day old leftovers. The kind that were left under a lamp. The PuPu Platter which costs 9.50 a piece contained jack sh1t. I ordered TWO of them , that is 19 dollars of Pu Pu Platter and the result I took a picture of because I couldn't believe it. \n\nThis is what 19 dollars looks like : http://i.imgur.com/TZhEuV5.jpg\n\nI called back, and was told this was a normal portion. Lol. \n\nI have been going here for years, and they finally lost me as a customer yesterday. I can say for certainty that I will never order from this place again, and neither should you. \n\nAs an aside I added up 50 an order 5 times a year for 16 years, me and my family have probably spent around 4000 dollars at this one place throughout that time.\n\nBye bye.",0
A fake plant in the corner was so thick with dust it made me question the cleanliness of the kitchen. Every door was dirty even the entrance doors which were glass and easy to clean. Food was not awesome.,0
"Okay used to be a 5 quickly turned into a 1 star all because of one night my family & I had been screwed over by this place.. If you have a family of 4 or more be prepared to wait wait wait and watch everyone else eat & leave before you even get the sight of food. I really enjoyed getting the hot tea they bring to your table before your meal I didn't even receive that we got one pot for 8 people including children.. two people were served food after 2 hours I honestly question myself why we waited so long waited some more, two people in our family finished their meal and the rest of us were still waiting. Did not even refill water, told the server continuously that other guests were eating and leaving before we even got a plate of something...we decided to leave we expressed our frustration to the \""""owner\"""" if that's what she even was and we refused to pay for nothing we received, we stormed out of there and she had the nerve to run out and record all of our license plates.. are you flipping kidding me.. no one was kidding when they told us \""""all they care about is, you got your food right?\"""" The two out of eight people that came to dinner came back to the restaurant asked for them to please throw out the license plate numbers they \""""sightly\"""" discounted the bill for the two plates & we now vow to never return to this crap hole of a restaurant. I will miss that lemon chicken but im sure there is another restaurant out there that would gladly appreciate our money than this place...\n\noh & I went into labor a few hours after this to top it all off. thanks little shanghai, thanks for sending me into labor....",0
Overpriced. Horrible food. An hour and 15 minute wait - are you kidding me? We won't be going back!!!,0
"We called for delivery at around 6:45 or so, and were told it would be between 30-45 minutes; it took a little longer, but there was a good reason!  When our delivery man arrived at the door breathless, he told me his car had broken down a few blocks over where he was making one delivery, but rather than make us wait, he WALKED all the way with our food to make sure we got it!  Tremendous service! \n\nThe food was delicious, and worth the wait -- plus, SUPER generous portions.  We got Chicken w/Veg and Orange Chicken, and there's enough left of both for at least one, if not two more meals.  The crab puffs were excellent, as well.\n\nIt's nice to have a good, reliable Chinese delivery in the center of town!",1
By far the best Chinese food in the valley. The interior decor is terribly dated and looks straight out of late 80s early 90s nightclub and lots of ceiling tiles need replacing. Many would view this as a drawback but they don't get the genius. The staff is friendly and familiar. Hot & Sour soup is the best item on the menu. Beef sticks are a close 2nd. The only mediocre dish is the duck. Overall a great place at a great price!!!! Would give them 10 stars if I could,1
"Came here on a recent Sunday for lunch with some friends.  Our friends have been here many times and said that Little Shanghai is recently under new ownership.  They open at noon on Sunday and we arrived just after they opened, were the first customers of the day.  I am not sure the sign on the door indicates hours for Sunday??  Anyway, we received attentive and pleasant service.  All 4 of us enjoyed our meals.  \n\nWe ordered chicken egg fu young, lemon chicken, sweet & sour pork, and chicken w/ vegetables.  Most of the entrees were around $9 each and came w/ family-style white rice.  No lunch specials/combinations available for Sunday (maybe same for Saturday?).  Portions were large and we all ended up with take-home containers for another meal.  Overall I thought the food and experience was good.  I would like to try lunch special when they are offered, would be nice to see something like this on the weekend. \n\nThe waitress said they will be open through all the holidays including Xmas and New Year's.  Something to remember if you don't feel like cooking....",1
Over prices for quality! No lobster in seafood platter. Pushy and rude waitress. Owner picked his nose behind the bar before making a Mai tai! Seriously.,0
"OK, if you like airbrush tanning,  this is the BEST place in Phoenix; BAR NONE.   \n\nSandy should be working with SI models.  She is EXTREMELY talented. EXTREMELY.  And, she grossly UNDERcharges.  I told her she should charge more.  \n\nUnfortunately, I could never get to my appointments on time, so I was ousted from the salon.\n\nBut, I still maintain that Sandy is the best airbrush artist in the state. You will never get a better color, for a longer period of time, for a more OBSCENELY low price.\n\nJust make sure you arrive on time...",1
"This is definitely my go to for when I'm in need of some color.  Whether it be a base tan needed before a vaca, maintaining that glow throughout winter... or even during the hot summer months when I just don't have time to lay out for hours.\n\nMost salons down here require a monthly membership. Not Camelback Tanning! The packages are all so flexible.. & inexpensive! I personally buy the individual 7 tans.. They never expire and can be used for either a bed or a stand up.. My personal preference is the stand up.\n\nLet's not get me started on the tanning lotion.  Same exact lotion I paid 90 bucks for in NY is sold here for 23 bucks !! What a deal!  .. Actually feel a little silly now looking back and paying so much for it.\n\nThe staff here is amazing and so is the ownership.  . You can truly tell they care about their customers... I've been coming here for years and I've never had a bulb out. \n\nI personally drive to Arcadia area just to go tanning here.. I live in south Scottsdale.  Worth the drive for me? - heck ya! .. I'll sacrifice time for quality any day of the week.\n\nIf you're new to the area or just looking for a place where you can save some $ ... Camelback tanning is my TOP recommendation.",1
This is my favorite tanning spot in Phoenix. Great prices and packages and a super friendly staff.  They gave me a discount on my package because I'm a regular.,1
"Ditto to Patti's review below mine... I recently switched to this 'discount dry cleaners' and I'm saving tons of $$$!  It is great quality and I have not had any problems yet (knock on wood)!  Every item is just $1.99 unless you bring in a coupon that they send out every few weeks direct mail and then you can get it for $1.75 each - even better!  \n\nI've even given them items that say 'do not dry clean' by accident, and they've caught them and refunded my money.  Be prepared that you pay when you drop off, and you need to pay with cash or check to avoid any additional fees.",1
"Great value.  The cost has gone up to a whopping $2.25 for dry cleaning items, but they do send out coupons for $1.95.  I've also tried to drop off items that aren't dry clean friendly and they've been aware enough to check the labels themselves for anything that doesn't look like a standard dry cleaning item.  I had one incident where the plastic adjustment piece on a strap of one of my tops broke while they were cleaning it and they paid to have a tailor fix it and that strap actually works better than the other one now.  :)  Good service and fast, in by 9am and out by 5pm.",1
"This is my dry cleaner of choice! When I first moved to Phoenix three years ago, I set out to find a dry cleaner that wasn't gonna break me. Sadly, most of them here in the valley do have outrageous prices, and for what? I tried a lot of them and I never really saw the value.\n\nThankfully I just happened upon Park Avenue Cleaners and I've never looked back. The employees are always extremely friendly and the prices per piece whether laundered or dry cleaned are very reasonable. I've taken everything here from dress shirts and slacks to ties with stains and even my comforter. Everything has come back better than before and extra points for not returning my shirts with broken buttons, which I'm guessing is the result from over-steaming them.\n\nI've recently moved, and Park Avenue Cleaners is no longer convenient but that's not gonna stop me from going out of my way to continue to use their services. Top notch!",1
"This has been my dry cleaner of choice for the last two years!  The service is great!  \nYou're usually greeted within seconds of walking in.  Your clothes are counted, you pay and your ticket is printed within minutes!  The employees are always very friendly and  pay close attention if you have any special instructions regarding your garments.  The price, $2.25/item for dry cleaning, is very reasonable!  One can often times find coupons for $1.99/item which was my initial motivator for trying out this cleaner.  \n\nThey also offer same day dry cleaning service at no additional price.  Drop off your items before 9:00 AM and pick them up by 4:00PM!  Great for those in a hurry!  \n\nCash is preferred but they will take debit cards for a $0.50 fee.",1
"this place is FANTASTIC!!! for $2.25/piece, you really can't go wrong with getting your clothes dry cleaned here! The staff was friendly, my clothing came back spotless, and everyone was happy! For all those interviews, conferences, board meetings when you need to be looking sharp, definitely take your clothes to park avenue cleaners!",1
"Simple quick service.  Stop by, drop off your goods, pay and then you're off.  If you place your order before 9, you can pick it up after 4p.  \n\nWhat more can a peep ask for?  Free of course, but then I'd have to find somewhere new.  \n\nFriendly staff, I have never waited longer than walking to register.",1
I keep giving them chances and they continue to fail. All my husbands shirts are ALWAYS wrinkled and with stains on them. This shouldn't be the case because I'm paying for my clothes to be cleaned and ironed! I tried to address the issue the first time this happened and one of the girls there was really rude. I honestly don't plan on coming back ever. Really bad customer service and they don't do what a dry cleaner is suppose to do.,0
The manager for this place should teach customer service classes. I have used this place for a year and always been wowed by the service (shame on me for never writing a review until now). Then Monday am act of kindness on top of a year of great service made me realize I owe it to them. My car battery died in front of the building and 2 of their staff members came outside to assist and make sure I was taken care of. Talk about going above and beyond. This was over the top. They are great everyday but that was giving 120%!!!,1
"If you're like me, you leave your laundry at the dry cleaners for weeks because it's super expensive and you don't want to pay for it when you get there because you're thinking... why even pick up my old clothes? For $30+ I can buy a new top and just go about my business.\n\nTHAT WON'T HAPPEN HERE!\n\nIt's super cheap - everything is $2.50 AND you prepay, so you get it over with when you drop your clothes off. On top of that - they're great! They've always taken great care of my clothes. If you're going to any other dry cleaner, you're wasting your time.\n\nAlso, coupons for their services are always in those annoying junk mail packets you get in your mail box... I literally open it up just to fish out that coupon and recycle the rest.",1
"Affordability, customer service, and quality all collide when you speak of Park Avenue Cleaners and David's crew. You do not need to sacrifice your dollars to get the results you want from a dry cleaning experience.\n\nDavid has been there for quite some time and his team has built the relationships necessary to build a successful business. They are part of our community. \n\nIf you need dry cleaning, you need to go to this establishment.",1
"This is a very basic, affordable dry cleaning operation. The staff is always friendly and they send out coupons almost weekly if you live in the area. My clothes always come back great and they are done on time.\nOne thing to note is that they do not clean tablecloths, just FYI.\nParking is easy and its always quick in and out.",1
My favorite dry cleaning in the area. I live in Scottsdale but I make the drive back to my fave spot in Arcadia. My family and I both go here and we have never had any problems with our clothing. I tend to do same day pick up anywhere so my clothes aren't piled up with others and get creases being shoved in after days. I picked up my clothes here after 2 days because I forgot about it and they looked phenomenol. Perfectly steamed and they got a stain out of my blouse. Awesome dry cleaning and friendly staff that has been around for some time. Keep up the great job guys.,1
Courteous staff speedy very inexpensive. The only dry cleaning we use. Make sure to get there before 9 am for same day service @ no extra charge,1
"seriously, how hard is it to make a decent fast food teryaki chicken bowl? and marble sized shumai?  what in the world?  if you're totally destitute and you can't find any other restaurant to spend your last dime on, then go ahead, you have been forewarned.\n\nhow do they stay in business is my question",0
"I probably should have yelped it before I went there.  But I was on the road and craving a rice bowl.  The place is dark (makes it dingy for me) and it was so quite for a lunch crowd.  Ordered the house chicken togo.  The taste of the sauce was weird...  not to garlicy, just blah...  Very disappointed...  Never going back!",0
"I was hoping to run into a Yoshi's, but I was on 32nd Street instead of 24th, so I went to this place instead. I ordered the #1 (teriyaki chicken and rice) with all white meat. The chicken was decent, if a bit on the dry side, but I didn't mind. The rice was good and sticky.  But there was merely a drizzle across the top of the bowl of teriyaki sauce. I got it to go, so when I got home and saw it, I was just disappointed. It wasn't bad, if I had ordered a dry bowl of rice with chicken on top...but alas, I won't be going back unless I am in dire straits and am out of options. It was just kinda bleh.",0
"If you like your service poor and your food with hair cooked in it, you've found the right place. Nummy!\n\nI let the hair thing go ONCE. After all it's not as bad as MY cooking, but the second time it happened I let them know they had permanently lost my business. \n\nTheir food is below greasy spoon quality as they do things to meat (at least I THINK it's meat) that are unholy. Like cooking their hair in your food and using salt by the pound on any dish. \n\nI used to love Kyoto bowl back in the nineties, but  I can see why so many of them are closing now. Bad food, bad service. Steer clear.",0
"This place is nasty, the spring roll tasted liked it had been frozen for 50 years.  The  beef broccoli tasted like  dead cats.  The shrimp was stinky, like it was not washed, the chicken strips were tiny and had no flavor at all.",0
"looks dirty and my simple to make teriyaki chicken bowl was drowned in the watered down sauce, but I was HUNGRY. So I ate it. mid way through I almost choked on a very sharp chicken bone and all for the low price of almost ten bucks for a bowl and small drink? The staff can barely speak English... dont think I will return.",0
This place serves a poor excuse for japanese food. I dont understand how they keep their doors open with the product they serve. Nothing on the menu is worth trying. \n\nThe man behind the counter is unfriendly and gave me a annoyed look when i asked for wasabi.,0
"Not terrible food, but not good either.  I'd never go back because good food is very easy to come by out here.  \n\nI had the Sukiyaki beef bowl.  It was beef, cabbage, and onion over rice.  There was a sauce used, but it might have just been soy sauce.  I got salt and umami out of it.  It was pretty much just overcooked beef and veggies over bad rice that was very salty.  It was $7.XX, but I should have gotten a hamburger at Wendy's or a salad at Safeway, because that would have been better.  \n\nI dislike it when reviewers waste my time talking about decor, but holy straight out of the 1990's!  Really dim, none of the signs are on, and the wall menu was one of those big black panels with yellow lettering that was backlit.  It really set the stage for the D- food.  It felt like walking into a Bradley's or Caldoor in 1993.\n\nI don't want to give 1 star, because 1 star places really did something to deserve it.  This place was just extremely underwhelming.",0
"http://www.arcadiaice.com/\n\nI discovered Arcadia Ice Arena after responding to a Craigslist ad looking for a Program Director who knew how to ice skate.  I responded, and scheduled an interview with Jim - the owner.\n\nLet me begin by saying by Jim is one of the most inspirational and community-minded people I've ever met - and I've met quite a few.  He began working at the arena as a young teen, and continued to do so while he pursued his college degree in Accounting.  He went on to play pro hockey, winning a championship, and returned to the arena after a spending a short time as an accountant - because Arcadia Ice Arena means everything to him.\n\nPlain and simple - this place is still open because Jim loves hockey and he knows creative accounting.  He pours his heart and soul into this arena, and employs teens that could use a little mentoring.  Arcadia is lucky to have him.\n\nYeah - the facilities are a little rough around the edges but that's hockey.  Jim showed me locker room repairs he'd made just a few days prior, explaining to me that its an impossible task to keep kids from smashing hockey sticks into everything; as a former child skater, I can relate wholeheartedly.\n\nAnyway, here's the best part.  At the rear of the arena, tucked behind the buildings, is my favorite bar in all of Phoenix.  Its a little divey, but its something special.  There's a few games, a free-standing fireplace, along with cold beer and an always-friendly bartender.  Behind her is a wall of glass, allowing you to watch the action on the rink from your bar stool.  I've never seen anything like it, and I guarantee you haven't either.  Its a must-visit.\n\nOne more thing: Jim is open to any event or gathering that you could possibly dream up.  We talked about doing some roller-rink style parties come late spring, so stay tuned!",1
"One lap around the rink and my feet were cracking! How is it that everyone else around me can strap on a pair of skates and hit the ice without any sign of fear and with confident poise and precision?  Unfortunately, I would not be singing the phrase, look mom no hands, during this ice skating field trip as my attempt was a total fail.  It's a good thing I had Julia T. at my side to help guide me hand in hand during my 10 min lap. Her calming voice in my left ear reminding not to chip at the ice, glide from side to side, hold your balance, you're doing good, come on you got it, yea right! This was much easier said than done and I was happy to get off the ice after one, full, long, torturous lap around the arena.        \n\nSo other than my lackluster debut, I'm giving a positive nod to AIA for a few very good reasons. Bringing me in out from the 113 degree heat, a very affordable activity, and for the quick getaway to the Ice House to partake in a before/after refreshment where next time, I'll be skating vicariously through my oh so cool friends. I'll be grinning from spectator box.",1
"This is the best way to get out of the summer heat. I am not all that good of a skater; but who are we kidding neither are you :-) The rink is full regulation and they offer open public skate everyday. Prices are reasonable. The owner is a wonderful guy; who keeps the ice in awesome shape! I recommend checking the schedule for open skate times, and where a sweater or hoodie. It can be a little chilly inside!",1
"I should start off by saying that we have taken the kids ice skating a few times at the Alltel ice den in N. Scottsdale.  A friend said we should try this place because it is a lot less crowded, which sounded nice because the open skate at the ice den can be chaotic and too crowded.  I should also say that I really wanted to like this place.  When we got there, it was not very clear where we pay for open skate and rent the skates.  We finally figured out that you have to go into the shop, so we went in and there was only one worker who was helping someone pick out skates, we had to wait a long time before she could ring us up to skate.  Then she didn't tell us where to go to get our skates, I had to ask her.  She pointed where to go, then she said she would be right there.  Is this a one-man operation??  So, again, we had to wait for her to come around.  The ice skates were in horrible condition, in my opinion, they seemed 30 years old!! We also rented some trainers for the kids.  (I couldn't believe we had to pay $5 each for them, they were made out of pvc pipe!!)\nThe ice was incredibly choppy and was hard to skate on and the place was just kind of yucky.  The only good thing I can say about it is that there weren't a lot of people, but I can see why!  I really don't think it's any cheaper than the ice den, in fact, their trainers definitely cost more and are way less sturdy.  Even though the ice den is more crowded, we will go there next time...",0
"This place is a train wreck in a refrigerator. Its very cold (which is to be expected) but also extremely dilapidated. The ceiling is falling in, its old and worn, and worst of all, there is NO ONE to control the children.  The children (which are more like teenagers) are running a muck, creating cracks in the ice and throwing it at other people. \n\nI don't like the ice throwing, and I don't like cold ceilings falling in. When asked if you should go to Arcadia say, \""""No!\""""",0
"Sometimes, an establishment gets an extra star boost for being unique. As the only ice rink in Phoenix, Arcadia Ice Arena is just that kind of place. And, needless to say, in an area that is consistently warm and a goddamn inferno in several months of the year, why shouldn't I reward a place that allows me to enter frigid temperatures and relax by taking a few spins around the ice? \n\nGranted, the place is in a moderately sketchy shopping center and the arena itself is rundown, but the staff is generally nice, the ice is well maintained and the prices are affordable (even before the recent slurry of Groupons). And, yes, I did just use a ice-related word. \n\nThe best part about Arcadia Ice Arena? The fantastic bar, Ice House, featuring a ton of different local and craft beers, microwave popcorn, live music on weekend nights, darts and a great view of the rink. What a one-of-a-kind experience to have here in the Valley of the Sun!",1
DONT COME HERE! Groupon users beware! I saw a sweet deal on groupon (15$ for four people for open skate) that was only a sweet deal online. The skates were so worn our feet had bruises on them afterwards. The lady who helped us with our skate size gave us all a size up even when we asked for a smaller size! It was so uncomfortable and very difficult to skate it in. As we managed to make the best of it  but could not bare we headed off the ice and a hockey coach saw our shoes were to big and mentioned next time we should get smaller skates on our way out. We also got off the ice because they rushed us off by starting to cleaning the ice 20 minutes before our time was up. Oh yeah It's also very hidden and hard to find.,0
I like coming to Arcadia Ice Den for two reasons.  The first one is that I love ice skating and second my husband plays hockey here.  Patently this ice rank is the best one in town.  It may not be in the best around of town.  But the ice rank is really nice. So if you want to go ice skating somewhere and are in the arcadia area you should come here to ice skate.,1
"I've been going there for a number of years and it's a great place to be away from the 100 degree heat for awhile.  I definitely agree with Craig about the aesthetics, it's an old rink, not flashy; it's homey to me -- reminds me a little bit of the McFetridge Sports Center in Chicago, but without the inside bar.\n\nThe only things I care about are (not necessarily in that order, but must be present): \n\n* my skates are sharpened just right at the right price (yay!)\n\n* a place to lock up my stuff, glide/fall numerous times on the ice, afterwards get a beer at the bar (tucked way in the back so the kids don't see it) \n\n*consistently friendly staff\n\n*happy kids and parents as a bonus (I don't mind lookin' out for the kids as they zip by me at 10mph)",1
"Awful. Just awful. We spent the majority of our visit trying to find a pair of skates that fit, which never happened. After coming to terms with the fact that these decrepit old skates were never going to fit properly we hit the \""""ice\"""". I say it that way because this was more like lumpy bumpy broken glass. The zamboni didn't make an appearance until free skate was over and it was time for us to leave. The blades on the skates were so dull that when paired with the ice rink that was mostly snow cone by now it was near impossible to skate. So my feet are wrecked and I skated for a probable collective fifteen minutes. Run down dirty old facility that obviously isn't very well up kept. Had it not been for the groupon we'd have never come and we won't be returning. #myfeethurt #ghettoice",0
"This place was so dingy.  The skates looked disgusting like someone or something had been chewing on them.  The facility really needs an uplift.  The ice was really choppy too. Almost could not find the location and no parking at the front of venue, only on the side or back. This was just weird since the place is in large shopping center.",0
I contacted them to replace the springs on my  leather couch. At first they seemed really helpful and interested in the work. I talked to the owner who was supposed to call me back to schedule when to come look at the couch and take it to their shop. That phone call never happened. I even called and left a message with the receptionist and he never called back. So the next day I called again and talked to him. He didn't care at all that he didn't call me back. He flatly told me that he was busy and that I was 1 of 20 people he needed to call or that had called him. Great that he is that busy but if he continues to disregard potential customers like he did me he won't be busy for much longer.,0
"If I could give zero stars, I would.\n\nThis guy is a joke.  I have been waiting to have my expensive leather sectional repaired for a very small stain since MAY 21st.  My couch is under warranty, and both the company and I have had no luck in getting Fred to call us back.  The repair is covered, and the guy should get paid.  So why am I getting the run-around?\n\nI initially called to inquire about their services, and was told I would receive a call the next day to set up an appointment for Fred to come out to my home.  One week, then two weeks go by - so I called and was told \""""oh, I thought you were already set up?\""""  So by this time, he was booked out for 2 weeks.  So I waited a total of 4 weeks before he came out to look at the piece.\n\nFred was over an hour late for our \""""appointment\"""" and seemed rushed and irritated when he was here.  He wanted to take the piece of my sectional back to his shop to fix it, although previously he told me he could fix it on site.  He kept going back and forth on what he wanted to do.  In addition, he couldn't give me an estimate but told me that it would probably be more than what my warranty would allow.  When I balked at this, he finally decided to not take my furniture (I wouldn't have allowed him anyway considering I probably wouldn't get it back for another 4 weeks).  He told me that I would receive a call the next day with the estimate.  Not surprisingly, AGAIN the call never came.  This was JUNE 25th.\n\nI called my furniture company's warranty line and explained the situation.  They called Leather Like New directly and also never received a call back, and I have since been looking for other services as now it is JULY 29th and my piece is still stained.  I am so frustrated.\n\nFred's excuse over and over was that he is \""""busy.\""""  I am a professional and we are all busy!  Customer service here is horrible; I felt pushed off, and honestly lied to about when I would get calls back.  I have called and left messages about my dissatisfaction.  I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY CALLS OR EXPRESSIONS OF REMORSE IN REGARDS TO HOW I HAVE BEEN TREATED.  Fred will not be busy for long.  I will never be recommending his services, or lack thereof for that matter.  If you want to be treated appropriately and with respect, and to have something done in a timely manner, please look elsewhere.",0
I went there one hour after they opened for a sandwich. The food was OK but they did not have any change. The person who was suppose to open the safe did not show up yet. Person at the counter had to use his own money to give me change.,0
"I'm an  Italian girl from New York and I can honestly say: Marcellino is one of the BEST Italian restaurants in the Valley. \n\nIf you like home made pasta, flavorful sauces, great wine and all the other elements that make a great Italian place - this is it! It even reminds me of a place back east with the owner (owner's wife?) working the door and the old school dessert ray presented by the waiter. \n\nMarcellino is not cheap, but it's price in on par with other high end Italian like Bravo Bistro, Um Bacio, Le Cabaffe, Tamasos...etc. But Marcellino might be the best!",1
"WAY TOO EXPENSIVE!\n\nYou shouldn't have to pay $22 for any pasta.  For two people, ordering vegetarian dishes and some wine and salad, the price was about $119.  Ridiculous.  Not even that tasty.  This restaurant has gone downhill, while the prices have gone way up.  I guess if you like a greasy, heavy, expensive, snobby restaurant, this is your place!\nWhere are the friendly neighborhood Italian restaurants of yesteryear?",0
"This place has good italian food for phoenix, but thats because the only real competition is Olive Garden and Carabbas. If this place were any place else like San Fran it would be done. I mean $30 - 40 for pasta? Come on now... Way overpriced and not that tasty.",0
"So this review is a little tardy as we dined at Marcellino's for New Years ... it was spectacular.  The service is top notch, friendly and professional, knowledgeable and prompt - the food was simple and delightfully tasty. \n\nMust admit I am a long time fan, though I don't go as often as I might like as a night out there will set you back a few dimes.  What I relish is the fresh, simple taste of dishes prepared with intention and care - easily the best Italian in Phoenix.  I also love to be greeted and schmoozed by the stunning Sima who always makes you feel welcomed back like an old friend.\n\nI'm going to get back here again soon as every time I dine here I think, why did I wait so long.",1
"Yes indeed, this is good as it gets!  After discovering Marcellino's a few years ago, I am now drawn there like a magnet.  Marcellino is a \""""real\"""" chef, personally designing each menu item..and the off-menu items, which change regularly, are his masterpieces.  \nThe atmosphere is unique to Phoenix - high class, personal, and sophisticated yet cozy.  This is a place for food, wine and conversation, not a see-and-be-seen joint.  That said, I've seen and met some of the Valley's movers and shakers here - business owners, politicians, artists, TV personalities, politicians.  The service is consistently top-notch and professional.  Family owned and operated, Marcellino and Sima pour their heart into this place, and it shows.",1
"Do you know what \""""scampi\"""" really is? \nI learned new food fact at Marcellino this week, something I should have known, but most of us probably don't. \""""Scampi\"""" is an animal - a type of lobster that looks a lot like a shrimp. I've always assumed \""""scampi\"""" was the shrimp in butter and garlic dish, but it turns out that is an American bastardization of the term. Real scampi is a particular type of lobster - not very common and very expensive, which is probably how the shrimp and garlic bit happened along. BTW, Marcellino's REAL scampi is lovely, served grilled \""""on the half shell\"""". Plan on sucking all the tasty bits off the shell.",1
"Best Gnocchi and meat sauce i've ever had.   A friend of mine, who's  a friend of Sima and Marcellino brought me here.  I'm always apprehensive about trying something new when it comes to Italian food.. but so glad I did.  They make everyone feel welcome and well taken cared of.  The servers posses an almost encyclopedic knowledge of their food offerings.  The ambiance is very nice, who knew it was in a strip mall?  My experiences are from 2006, so I'm a little late to the review table, but I had to throw my 2 cents in.  Once you get over the slight sticker shock, you will definitely contemplate how soon your return will be.  Only bummer is I believe they close during the summer months.",1
"If you want to impress a date, take them to Marcellino's.  My first visit there was with a date, and I was definitely impressed.   Your dining experience there will be private, personal and in a lovely atmosphere.  As a diner, you will feel like everything is especially for you.... and it is. Marcellino makes sure that your meal is worth savoring and that you will appreciate your evening enough to return.",1
"Maybe the only place in AZ that makes their own pasta? 5 stars by Arizona standards, 3 by Italy and other foodie joints across the globe - hence the compromise. Sorry AZ, you are on a relative scale.\n\nI was bummed, because I was the only person in this restaurant for an hour and a half at 7 on a thursday night. Finally a good Italian joint in Phoenix and nobody shows-up. I hope this place survives.",1
"In college (not that long ago, but boy I am getting old fast) I had the opportunity to spend a month in northern Italy.  Marcellino Ristorante takes me back.\n\nYou will find no finer Italian restaurant in Phoenix.  The pastas are exceptional, unique, and fresh.  The atmosphere is superb.  The wait staff if phenomenally proficient yet down to earth and friendly at the same time.\n\nYou owe it to yourself to treat you and a loved one to this experience.",1
"This is one of my favorite 'celebration night out' places.  The owners are wonderfully nice and friendly.  The service was great - excellent timing on filling water, clearing table - it was all seamless. \n\nNow the food!  Home made pasta, fresh and original. Everything was tempting but I can never resist the specialty of the day - seafood linguini, mushroom sauce, or any other meats - gently cooked!  Perfect! \nWith a bottle of wine, meal and dessert - it can get pricey but it's well worth it! \n\nThey do offer Valentine 'take out baskets' which are reasonably priced (considering) and sound wonderful -i must admit, i have never tried them though.",1
"I really liked the experience I had at Marcellino's on Friday night.  They had opera singers from the Phoenix Symphony performing which were very good.  I enjoyed my handmade ravioli with spinach and yummy cheese (not fish yay!) filling and the wine and the mouse.  It was good!! \n\nBut then something happened....my date gave the server his card to pay for the meal and it was brought back as not able to be processed (yikes!).  The server also informed him that they'd been able to process someone else's but one other didn't go through.  My date checked his account on line and it had plenty to cover, but had just enough cash to cover the tab, not really enough for a tip.  So he asked the server if they would try to put a lesser amount on the card to cover the tip and take the cash.  This is when the server informed us that the machine might be down and it wasn't just his it was everyone's! So he kinda lied earlier, which wasn't cool.  We then waited another 30 minutes without an appearance by the server to explain what was going on, although I could see Marcellino working on the machine, even trying his own card.  My date got up to go speak with him, and the server tried to divert him, but he was respectful and wanted to speak with the owner.  No attempt was made to really apologize for the delay or make up for the wait...so they wrote down his information and address to mail him a receipt.\n\nThen, the next day, he checked his account and he'd been charged twice!! :( sad, because I thought I might like to go back at some point.",1
"Pretentious and overrated.\n\nThis is the kind of restaurant for people who a) miss New York, or b) don't know what they're talking about.  This is the kind of restaurant where you'll pay $200 for $100 worth of food.  It's not that it's bad, it's that it's pretentious.  To pay this kind of money is a strip shopping center is...overrated.\n\nYes, the owner-hostess it's just not worth it.  Very snooty to other patrons she deemed unworthy, save the money, go elsewhere.",0
Food was not as great as I read on the reviews. I went to have a nice dinner with my wife and the waiter was hitting on me. Gross.\n\nfood was overpriced and restaurant not that nice.,0
"I had read the reviews on Yelp of Marcellino's, and so was eager to try it, so I scheduled a lunch meeting there today.  Given the glowing reviews, I will probably give it one more chance at dinner sometime, but it was definitely a let down.  I had a six top, and we were six of the 8 people in the entire place for lunch.  \n\nService was good, with frequent refills, and they left us plenty of time to get to business before taking our orders.  There was an alright red pepper spread for the bread, although olive oil and balsamic would have been a welcome addition.  Most of the table got either grilled chicken or salmon, which came with a small green salad: portions were very small for mid teens to lower 20s per entree for lunch.  I and another person got the shrimp and scallops in a lightly spiced red sauce with linguine dish.  There were plenty of shrimp, but they were small and extremely overcooked: they reminded me of shrimp that have been left in a ceviche for too long.  The scallops were cut into very small pieces, and were also overcooked, although not as badly as the shrimp were.  The sauce was made with fresh tomatoes, which were left in large chunks, and I have to say I would have very much preferred the use of canned San Marzano tomatoes instead: it was mild, with little body to it.  The pasta was not badly done, but seemed a bit soft for my taste in pasta.\n\nOverall, very disappointing, but so many good experiences can't be wrong, can they?",0
"Not very impressed, food was just ok.  Way over priced.",0
"What a wonderful dining experience as my wife and I celebrated 30 years of marriage at this upscale Italian restaurant. \nWe opted for the Monday night three course chefs special with the wine paring.  There was a bit of mixup as the Internet price ($49 p/p) did not reflecrt the price increase after their move to the new location.  However after a short  discussion, the Internet price was honored.\n \nAfter the complimentary bruchetta, our first wine was presented to us - a lovely chianti blend that introduced our first course.  The first course had two very different offerings.  A wonderful mushroom sauce was served over Polenta - this was my favorite.  The other offering in the first course was traditional Insalata Caprese - mozzarella, local tomatoes and basil.  Both of these dishes were perfect.\nThe second course was preceded by a local Tuscany red wine that was a blend of 4 grapes.  This pasta course was highlighted by a delicious white seven cheese ravioli complimented with a red sausage and marinara  pasta dish.  All of their pastas are home made and were cooked to perfection.  The ravioli was my favorite!\n\nThe main course consisted of two fillets of a Mediterranean fish that was a member of the Monk fish family.  It was served with a yummy garlic sauce and accented by perfectly mashed white potatoes dressed with fresh Basil. \n\nThe evening was romantic and the service was just right.  We had a wonderful dining experience in this Anniversary stopover in Scottsdale.",1
"This is a fabulous Italian restaurant.  The service is impeccable and very professional.  The waiter seemed to have an infinite knowledge of almost every menu item available.  It was like nothing I've ever seen.\n\nThe food is excellent, as well.  Some of the specials are quite pricey, but everything is handmade and worth the money.  This is definitely a great place for special occasions.\n\nThe old restaurant in uptown Phoenix was a bit more quaint and more convenient for me, but I'm willing to make the drive anywhere in the valley for this great restaurant.  I'm actually planning my (small) rehearsal dinner there for later this year.",1
"We had a private party scheduled for the 3-course chef tasting dinner.  The room was not ready, the menu was not as we discussed (there were meat dishes and we had a few vegetarians), the A/V equipment didn't work.   One of the guests also got a cup of coffee that tasted like chicken broth...the owner came back with some excuse for this, but the issue was not corrected.  We all had been looking forward to this dinner for some time now since we heard good things about this restaurant - this bad experience was enough for me not to return.",0
This place sucks. Food was average and we had to wait an hour even though we had a reservation. My americano tasted like warm soy sauce and they blamed it on the RO system. The owner made all sorts of excuses and took a whopping $50 off our $1100 bill. We won't be back!,0
"Had feared that after moving to chic Scottsdale the food would suffer.  Thankfully that is not the case.  I love their pasta.  I don't even bother with the proteins, it is the pasta that is the star.  The crowd tends to skew a little older, (i.e. not the best place to that your fraternity brother), and even a first date might be a little off-putting.  In fact, you should probably confirm you like the person since the prices are a little steep.  But if you are willing to make the time and money commitment, there is no better place in town for wonderful fresh pasta that is toothsome and delicious.  The sauces lovingly envelope each bite and never overwhelms.  Bread is served and it is good, but do not fill up on bread no matter how much you like the eggplant spread that comes with it.  Come hungry, leave happy.  I'm still smiling.",1
We had a large group of 18 for dinner Saturday night. Marcellino would personally come out from the kitchen after every course and,1
The experience at Marcellino Ristorante is perfect and I love their new location in Scottsdale!,1
"Finally checked out Marcellino at their Scottsdale location for the first time.  It's as good as it always has been and the new location offers more space and a nice ambiance. The food is still great, the service was very warm, and the whole atmosphere is still inviting and cozy.  I had feared their move to Scottsdale would cause it to become overly trendy and lose focus, but I far undersold Marcellino and his team.  And despite having great food, the prices are quite reasonable.  Having dined in Italy recently, I can say the experience here was on par with that and hope to I to return soon.",1
"My husband and I adore Marcellino's. If you are looking for a special evening out for Italian food, look no further. This is not your family-style restaurant, it's high end with amazing homemade pastas, fresh salads, spotless service, truly a wonderful experience. From the time you make a reservation, you are greeted with warmth, just as if you were invited into their home. We have followed them from their old location in north Phoenix to the new in Scottsdale. Somehow they were able to keep the intimacy of the smaller restaurant to their new, larger location. My only complaint is that the restaurant is so dark it makes reading the menus difficult (they should offer flashlights or invest in backlit menus).\nWe have had two company parties at their restaurant. They easily cater to large groups. Our food arrived steaming hot all at once (incredible for a party of 13).\nI wish I could recommend a favorite dish, but my favorite is whatever I ordered during my last visit! You can't go wrong with any of the dishes. The bar is we'll stocked and he makes great mixed drinks. Definitely arrive a few minutes early to start off at the bar before being seated for your meal.",1
"I do not understand how this restaurant has such high rating anywhere! I am Italian and LOVE good Italian food and make it homemade myself... I took my boyfriend to Marcellino for his Birthday and was thoroughly disappointed in almost EVERYTHING! \nFirst, on a positive note, it is a beautiful location and great atmosphere... Perfect for a romantic date.\nSecond, the negative... I do not know how they managed to make a salad taste bad, but they did... It tasted bitter and bland and lacking any real preparation. Then their pasta... There was no flavor or depth or excitement at all! I don't know about you, but Italian food is supposed to warm you from the inside out and fulfill all your senses from sight to smell and of course taste!\nWhen we finished the meal, the waiter asked us how it was, and I told him I really was not impressed and disappointed after expecting something much more. He quickly got defensive and proceeded to quote all the \""""awards\"""" and \""""ratings\"""" they have received and when I mentioned I was Italian, he said the food I was used to but be from a different region. He was rude and un-accommodating.\n\nI have no problem paying $20-$30 per plate, but only if there is quality to back it up. Do not waste your time or money if you are anticipating FABULOUS Italian food, but if you don't mind paying for a nice atmosphere and mediocre, overpriced food, then Marcellino might be your place.",0
"Overpriced entrees, underwhelming food. My wife and I made a trip to Scottsdale to enjoy some warm weather and down time this spring. We wanted a good meal for our last night and were encouraged to read some of the reviews of this place. Owned by Italians, homemade pastas -- sounded right up our alley. Unfortunately, we were significantly disappointed. We both had pasta specials (I had the parpadelle w/ lamb ragu and she had the squid ink pasta w/ half a lobster, clams and mussels). I'm not one to complain about prices but I do have a problem with places charging big prices only to severely miss the mark on flavor. The parpadelle and squid ink pasta were $40 and $50 respectively. The parpadelle is a dish that even the swankiest restaurants in NYC charge $20 at most for. The squid ink claimed to have \""""1/2 of a whole lobster\"""" but we could only find a few bits of overcooked tail in it. Skimping on the lobster left a terrible impression with me and led me to believe that they're pulling a fast one on us. This feeling was further validated after the waiter came by to inform us that he asked the chef to remove the meat from the shell so \""""the lady wouldn't have to get her hands dirty.\"""" When the dish came, we were shocked when we didn't find an ounce of claw meat in the dish. \n\nFinally, but most importantly, the flavor. The parpadelle was decent but the \""""fresh, homemade pasta\"""" was way too thick. About twice the thickness that I've ever eaten (in even the crappiest of places). The thickness of the pasta coupled with the fact that it did not seem like they ever finished the noodles in the sauce left both dishes very unbalanced. Heavy on the pasta -- even though they had a heavy handed approach to the sauce.\n\nAside from the pastas, we had the cheesecake and gelato - both of which were more disappointing than the pastas. \n\nThe cherry on the top? The cheesy lounge singing performer at dinner. Really? Am I in a vegas lounge? Save the money and your palette. I'm sure there are other excellent places in Scottsdale -- I was only hoping Marcellino's was one of them. Unfortunately, it wasn't and the only folks benefitting are the owners that should be ashamed of the dishes they're putting out there.",0
I was with a very large group that they handled very well.  Each most of us ordered one of the specials and all were great with freshly made pasta.  Excellent service.,1
"Absolutely amazing.  Pricey but worth it.  The veal parmigiana is to die for, and my husband's chicken marsala looked great as well.  The desserts were delicious, the garlic bread was delicious, the pasta was out of control... \n\nThe owner is so friendly and he came over to the table to talk to us.  The service was impeccable.  I cannot recommend it highly enough if you are in the scottsdale az",1
"I have been waiting to try this restaurant for a while.  I decided to take my wife to celebrate a special occasion.  Restaurant has a great atmosphere and the service was very good.  Everything on the menu is overpriced.  \n\nThe homemade pasta is fresh and perfectly cooked.  The flavor of the pasta dishes we ordered were good, but not great.  I ordered the pappardelle in a lamb ragu.  Ragu was salty.  My wife ordered the linguini with lobster.  Lobster was a bit rubbery and dish had very little flavor.  I will not return.",0
"My husband and I stumbled across this place while walking around downtown on a Friday night. It was the ambiance of the restaurant that attracted us, romatic, dimly lit with an outdoor patio. When we walked up to the hostess, we told her we did not have a reservation, though would like to sit for dinner. She was extremely rude, annoyed, and walked away. I actually looked at my husband and started to leave the restaurant, until the waiter nearby caught what happened and seated us on the patio. \n\nThe food was amazing-- the gnocchi was so soft and tender, best ever. My husband ordered some special mushroom infused pasta.. It was also delicious. I would definitely return, next time making sure I have a reservation I guess.",1
"Pros: cute \nNice wAit staff\n\n\nCons: price 35+ per plate\nTaste: bland and under done meat cooked wrong\nLighting: very dark \nCold plates and food.\nWhen two plates were taken back for taste they showed up anyway on our bill\nWhen we had an issue with our food the manager only came to the table once, the chef never came out, the food was solid OK if we were at applebees this would still only be three stars\n\nSave e $$",0
"The worst ever!  Our food was cold and tasteless. A group of us were celebrating our daughters graduation from law school.  There were 8 of us and the restaurant was not busy.  All of our food was served cold, obviously it had sat in the kitchen.  We sent back two meals and they brought tasteless pasta dishes and kept the two expensive meals on the bill. They left the table with our  dirty dishes sitting in front of us for 40 minutes.  Once we were not happy our server disappeared as did the other staff. Due to our daughters tears when we complained, as it was her choice of restaurant and she felt responsible, we let it go and paid our bill.  I wrote them after and have gotten NO response from them.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AT THIS RESTAURANT!!!!",0
Excellent service and food.   Black ink pasta with seafood is delicious.  Try the mozzarella with tomatoes.  Parking can be a little challenging but there are valet options close.,1
Went with my wife for just dessert. Had one of the best tiramisu. Live music was great. Bit pricey.,1
"Over rated and over priced. \n\nI've been here a number of times and never been impressed with any of the specials or their homemade pastas either. Every time I left however, I was reminded of how expensive it is, especially if you go with chef and waiter recommendations.  We also have a hard time understanding why the owner/chef will not make guest request changes to any of the entrees.  For example, if someone wants a different sauce with their pasta or their entree prepared a certain way, why would the owner refuse to do so ?  I've seen this happen twice at this restaurant and both time guests have been put in unpleasant positions while ruining their dining experience.    Its too bad that there are not that many great italian restaurants in the Phoenix - Scottsdale area, and Marcellino's falls into that category as well.",0
"Best Italian Food In the City!!!\nMy parents were in from out of town and we have a huge family dinner at Marcellino's Ristorante. Among our party of 9 we had two toddlers with us.  The staff was able to create dishes for these fussy eaters as well as meeting and exceeding the cravings of the entire group. The wine list is all Italian wines but I would totally recommend the Sor Ugo and Gavi di Gavi We started with the appetizer feature with soft mozzarella and prosciutto which was AMAZING!! The Santa Lucia was fantastic with half a lobster and a variety of shell fish. I was barely able to taste the tortelloni that one of my family members had gotten becuase while we are all family we dont share.  Dessert was no exception to the meal and dont expect to see cannoli's on this menu, traditional Italian dessert is what you will find.  Ricotta cheese cake, Tiramisu, Gelato, were just a few of the desserts that hit our table.  \nChef Marcellino and his wife Sima also stopped by the table which made the night that much more special.  Thank you to all of the staff chefs and servers a like for making our night extra special",1
"Fresh pasta and high quality ingredients make all the difference. This place has the best bucatini amatriciana, heck maybe anywhere. It isn't just good for AZ. It's actually good. Seriously this compares to east coast Italian. Everything was cooked perfectly. The party I was with consumed a great deal of wine, and seemed to approve of the list. Deserts (cheesecake, tiramisu) were also pretty great. Service was attentive.",1
"The atmosphere is beautiful and service was excellent.  Unfortunately, the food was less than mediocre.  Ravioli special with spinach and ricotta was like sand, pasta was hard,marinara with sausage, pasta under cooked, wouldn't return.",0
Good food and service. Would definitely go back.,1
"My husband took me to Marcellino Ristorante for our wedding anniversary.  I was impressed how nice the restaurant looked, it was very pretty.  We were greeted by a pleasant hostess and seated at a nice table.  Our waitress, Vita, was perfect example of what all wait staff should model themselves after.  She was very knowledgeable about every item on the menu and was very energetic and enthusiastic.  If the owners of Marcellino read this, all I can say is, \""""NEVER LET HER GO!\""""  OK with that being said, we ordered the mussels appetizer and the pesto scallop appetizer.  They were good.  The mussels were on the large size and a little tough, but all and all they were good.  The scallops were luke warm in the middle, but still not too cold to eat.  I expected more out of the pesto, it was a little flat on flavor.  They also served us some nice bread with a little red dipping sauce.  It was a nice departure for balsamic and olive oil.  It went well with our wine.\nMoving on to the entr\u00e9e, we ordered one of the specials to share, the Fettuccine Santa Lucia.  Fresh made pasta Infused with the ink from the cuttle fish.  It came in a spicy red sauce saut\u00e9ed with mussels, clams, and calamari.  They state that it is served with  1/2 of a 1  1/2 lb. fresh Maine lobster in shell, but the waitress said they would remove it from the shell for us.  So I was on board with that!  The entr\u00e9e was very good, again the mussels were on the tough side but the clams were perfect.  The lobster was sadly overcooked.  The pasta was nice.  We did enjoy that part, but I wish we would have ordered the Tortelloni that was stuffed with Filet mignon and saut\u00e9ed vegetables.  I think maybe it is not a good time for mussels right now and possibly a vendor/supplier issue?  I had a bad experience with them at a different establishment last week, but that is a different review.  We were so full, we couldn't even think about dessert!  I am sure they were awesome.  We finished out our meal by sipping on limoncello.  Very nice.  This was an enjoyable experience and we will go back.  I have to try that Tortelloni!",1
"Brilliant - Server Scott was all over us! Fresh made pasta - ambiance perfect. Would go back again and again! Thank Chef, Scott and staff! I hope the translation is correct, That was Wonderful! Che \u00e8 stato meraviglioso!!!",1
Marcellino. This is supposed to be one if not best Italian restaurant in town. I was very disappointed in their specialty - the fresh pastas - \n\nMany classic dish are offered and many different cut of pasta. The quality doesn't justify the stiff prices. Just ok!,0
Very impressed with the pasta special.\nBig portions and quality food. \nThe live music was a perfect volume and waiters were very attentive.\n\nThe only complaint that I have is the mediocre seating. \n\nI would recommend this to anyone craving Italian food.,1
Great place. Loved it. Good starters loved every bite. Pasta fantastic. And lastly loved the Tiramisu. Will be back,1
"We have just finished a dinner at the Citizen Public House and were still not just feeling like going home yet. Maybe grabbing another drink and a little bite to eat before we go home. It was after 9pm Saturday night. We naturally strolled around Marcellino's on our way back to garage and I said: \""""What about trying this before we go?!\"""" Told the hostess we are looking for a drink and maybe a little bite to eat and we would not mind sitting at the bar. She told us nothing is available for another 45 mins, and she asked if we are going to eat food...?! We said we have already finished our dinner but would not mind to taste a bit of their cuisine and inquired about sitting on a patio or at the bar. There were 3 or more 2-place seats at the bar while we were not offered either one of these. With quite a sarcastic voice she told us: WHATEVER MAKES YOU HAPPY. We have decided to follow her suggestion and left the restaurant -  which made us happy.",0
"Mediocre at best. Nothing was outstanding - for the prices, I had much higher expectations.",0
"Should be renamed Blandini's.  No seasoning.  NONE!\n\nWe were in a large group & had limited options. \n\nSalad was OK.  Spinach Ravioli was two large pieces, but missing sauce & seasoning.\n\nIt got worse from there.  Our entrees were completely bland.  Absent salt, pepper, and herbs of any kind.  Husband had lamb.  Knowledgeable diner (Cordon Bleu grad) said the \""""sea bass\"""" was tilapia.  They accomodated me with chicken, it had some tomatoes on it, but just was missing flavor.\n\nI'm not sure if they dumbed down their seasoning thinking to aim for something a person from the Midwest would like, but we're from Texas and we were VERY DISAPPOINTED in this food.\n\nCan't remember what we had for desert, but it was ample & tasted good.\n\nServers did a good job, considering the size of our group.",0
"I am not sure what the hype is.  I went here based on its recommendation in the who's who of restaurants publicized in the So Scottsdale magazine.  It was mediocre, and the ambiance reminded me of eating at Disneyland, you knew it was make believe but you wanted to believe.  I wanted to believe this was going to be a great meal, but instead it was lack luster.",0
My wife and moved from Chicago to Paradise Valley and where  looking for authentic Italian cuisine. All we can say is this is the place! The BEST,1
"We love getting our Italian On... and we think this a great gem that we never knew existed.  If you just google \""""Italian restaurants in Phoenix\"""" this one will always rise to the top.\n\nIt's tough to find, because there is a Mexican place in front of it.  We had to stop in the street and stare for a second to find it.  We were greeted by Vita who was also our server who gave us a great window seat.    The food was fantastic.  We opted for some of the homemade pasta options (different pastas are made fresh each day) - I had a sundried tomato pasta with a spicy red and with scallops and shrimp.  She tried the gnocchi and the tortellini stuffed with meat.   Everything was perfect.   We would definitely go again.  What's great is we were shopping at the mall and drove here, not really knowing we could walk past olive and Ivy, over the water and we would be there.  We are looking forward to our next mall visit with a darn good lunch.",1
We went for our 5 year wedding anniversary. We had been several times before and the food was memorable. This evening it was nothing like our previous experience. The dishes were all lacking flavor. I ordered the ravioli which I was so looking forward to and I was extremely disappointed. It was lacking flavor and was no where near the tasty dish I remembered from before. We also ordered the clam and muddle appetizer which tasted like rubber doused in water. We left spending $150 and wishing we went to Hillstone or another restaurant for our special evening out.,0
"Went Saturday night for drinks and dessert since Franco's Cafe is closed on vacation. We had Tiramisu, it was small to share but very good. The espresso is very well made, short pour with the creme' on top, so made just like in Italy, perfection! We both had a cocktail. I can't remember what my husband had and I had the chocolate.tini We both had the same reaction about the drinks good but we weren't wow'ed and they both were little smaller than we expected for the price. The singer was great and a nice addition to the evening. My husband appreciated that they allowed him to sit outside at  the farthest table from the entrance so he could have a cigar, so I'm sure we will be back.",1
"We love this place! We've been a few times and have always had a great time and a fantastic meal. The last time we were there, we had a strange experience with one of the waiters, he seemed completely put out, like he wanted to be somewhere else. We spoke to Sima and she assigned someone else to our table ~ everything was great!!",1
"Marcellino Ristorante is a truly excellent Italian restaurant. There are many options especially in Scottsdale for fine dining, especially if one craves Italian cuisine. However, one seldom finds as complete a package as Marcellino. The combination of ambience, charming decor, impeccable service, and flavorful dishes makes this an excellent choice if you are bringing a date or celebarting a special occasion. Try the homemade pasta, trust me it is to die for. They also have a version of chicken saltimboca (can't remember the menu name) that is heavenly. If you dine al fresco, you might get some live music blaring from Tapas Papa Frita, which is either a plus or minus depending on your threshold for music volume. Prices are somewhat high, but is within the expected range for a classy Scottsdale establishment. One downside is that I would not recommend the mussels appetizer as the mussels are tiny. The desserts are homemade and decent although not something I would write home about. Truly the main course is the crown jewel of this establishment's menu, but don't get me wrong - the appetizers and desserts (that we tried) are fine, just not up to the standard of the rest of the restaurant.",1
"Great atmosphere, great service (our waiter was most entertaining), impressive wine selection, phenomenal food. Deciding to take advantage of the cooler weather, we enjoyed our meal on the quaint patio. I had the seafood special with squid ink pasta, mussels, clams, calamari and a 3/4 lb. lobster in a spicy marinara sauce. It was easily one of the most enjoyable Italian dishes I've tried yet (and I consider myself to be quite the Italian cuisine connoisseur). I will definitely be back to enjoy this neighborhood gem situated on the Waterfront in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale.",1
we went to Marcellino since it was recommended to us as one of the finest restaurants in Scottsdale. Not so. It probably is the worst food I have ever tasted. The mozzarella was very rubbery like the one bought from a supermarket. Their signature pasta was thick and bland. The pork medallion was totally inedible and the only good item in our order was the wine.\nAt some point the chef/owner came to talk and would no go away till we started to get up. This was definitely frendliness bordering on harassment.,0
"My wife and I had an amazing dining experience last night from start to finish for our first time in this amazing restaurant. The ambience, staff, food and drinks were outstanding! The pre dinner cocktails were a perfect start. My wife had the Pure Bliss and I had the Spritz. I felt like I was back in Italy sipping on this refreshing aperitif! Marcellino's home made fresh pasta was nothing short of outstanding. My wife had the Strachetti w truffles and sausage and I had the tortoloni stuffed w filet. Ridiculously good. The home made Tartufo accompanied w an espresso martini was the perfect ending to a perfect night. Our servers Daniel and Mike were excellent as were our bus boys who were pleasant and attentive. Expect to pay but originally being from NYC we are used to these prices. I never mind paying when you have such an amazing date night experience! Grazie mille Marcellino!  We will definitely be back.",1
Very nice atmosphere.  Great bartender!  Food was overpriced for pasta. We sat on the patio and were surprised by the fact that a dog ran into the restaurant (not a service dog) and then the owner picked it up and was seated on the patio.  The owner of the dog processed to kiss the dog at the table tongue and all.  It was unsettling lucky we had already finished our meals.  Very odd that an upscale Scottsdale restaurant would allow this.  We would probably not go back,0
"I was so disappointed by the food.  Very bland. .. no flavor.   I had the pork medallions and not only were they overcooked,  but almost not edible...no spices.  My husband had the seafood pasta.. again,  horrid with no flavor. . He had to add salt and a lot of cheese just to get it down.\n\nBread seemed old and the spread they served with it was also tasteless...we asked for butter and it tasted funny... something was just not right. \n\nUpside was the wine. . Very good. \n\nNeedless to say we won't be back.",0
"Incredibly delicious, FRESH pasta a culinary pleasure.\nA must on your schedule of restaurants to visit in Scottsdale.",1
"This restaurant was excellent. Best Italian cuisine ever. The staff was very friendly, their wine selection very good. Oh! and lets not forget the delicious desserts...yummmmyyyy.I am definetly going back to this place if I am ever in Phoenix again.",1
"Tutti Santi is one of our valley jewels. Nina is so wonderful, I hope you can meet her -- her hospitality and joy in preparing a feast for you and your guests is very hard to match.\n\nI went to celebrate a friend's birthday, so I started with a bottle of champagne. I know it's very Reunite of me, but I like Spumanti. And there it was on the list. Excellent. Followed with a bottle of Pinot Gris, but it was too cold.\n\nLinguine with Clams was divine. Didn't have the creamy thickness of the lavish dish I had in Venice last month until I dumped half the shaker's Parmesan on top (ok, it was closer to 3/4 of the shaker), but oh, SO good. The sourdough bread was hot and fresh -- mmm, my favorite.\n\nWe finished off with a flaming shot of licorice liqueur. I wasted so much time taking a picture of it, the glass burned my lips when I actually got to tasting it. LOL.\n\nTutti is not pretentious, just very good food and excellent service. A must try.",1
"Went to Tutti i Santi with a group of friends.....the hostess was very nice and we got seated right away even without a reservation. The server was extremely attentive... we got water and the wine arrived at the table a few minutes after we ordered. The group started with the fried calamari with a side of marinara, which I didn't care for. I ordered the linguine with clams in white wine sauce, very tasty, although the pasta was a little overcooked. My wife had the eggplant parmigiana which was good, but not the best she has ever had. The desserts were Bindi desserts imported from Italy. We had the torta della nonna, a lemon cream pine nut tart, which was very good.  We finished the night with a shot of sambuca flambe'....nice touch.  Overall I like Tutti i Santi, it always feels like you are in an old restaurant in a \"""" piazza\""""in Italy.",1
"You can't fake diarrhea. \n\nThese f*rs gave me VEAL parmigiana when I'd ordered CHICKEN. Until then, I'd never eaten veal and had no desire ever to do so. \n\nI was so upset and the best both the waiter and manager could do was apologize, say they'd take it off the bill (they better!!! I had two bites!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!), then launch an explanation as to how, on a busy night, the kitchen could make a mistake. \n\nI don't care WHY it happened. That's the restaurant's business. I care THAT IT HAPPENED. Unconscionable.  \n\nTo top it off, I had total food poisoning that night and the following morning. Yes, I was completely nauseated that I'd consumed veal, but this wasn't psychosomatic. \n\nLike I said, you can't fake diarrhea.",0
"This is the spot for some of the best Italian food!\n Hands down, THE BEST RAVIOLI, with a  lovely marana and a touch of cream, it melts in your mouth, like nothing I have ever had before, it is one of their specialties, made fresh every day, it is A MUST...\n The veal marsala is FANTASTIC, tender and tasty, the marsala sauce is smooth and sweet. Linguini w/ Clams is just DELICIOUS, you can taste the freshness in the clams( Hard to find in Phoenix)\n  They end each meal with a sambuca lit on fire, Nice Touch!!!\n  They have a great wine list and a full bar.\n I love it, have been going for about 6 years, It is a little pricey, so the visits are not as frequent as I would like.",1
"Food ranges from delicious (elegant and lovely beef carpaccio) to mediocre (bland chicken rollatini and what might as well have been frozen vegetables).  The servers are lovely and attentive, and sort of distract you from the distinctly geriatric feel in the place.  My husband and I felt like the youngest people in the restaurant by at least 40 years.  I have no idea where this best ravioli nomination came from - they are abysmally forgettable.  I am hard-pressed to believe that a better ravioli cannot be found in Phoenix - there are just way too many good culinary adventures in the area to consider these bland, oversauced pillows of flavorless ricotta worth ordering.  \n\nUnimpressed by everything, we were bowled over by the bill.  How could a meal so forgettable come out to $150 for the two of us?  Was the wine that expensive? No.  Did we order anything extraordinary? No. Are we going back? You already know the answer...",0
"Wow!!  This is amazing... my new favorite place.  \n\nI went with my mom, brother and his wife to celebrate my sister-in-law's birthday.\n\nMy mom had been raving about the ravioli and she was right - they are amazing!! \n\nI had looked at the menu and was torn between ordering the homemade ravioli (cheese & spinach filling) with a cream/tomato sauce or the homemade gnocchi with the same cream/tomato sauce.  So, I convinced the table to order the gnocchi appetizer (a small version of the gnocchi dinner).  It was amazing!!!  The best gnocchi I've ever had.  Really light and melts in your mouth.  And the cream and tomato sauce is really fresh and creamy at the same time.\n\nThe garlic bread that comes with the dinners is good - even better dipped in olive oil and balsamic (which they will bring you if you ask).\n\nThe dinners all come with either soup or salad.  I had read on Yelp that the soups were really good.  So, my mom and I got their soup of the day - a cream of vegetable soup - cauliflower, brocolli, carrots, potato.....  Really, creamy and flavorful and light - it was amazing!!!!  My brother and his wife both got the salads.  They both ate them but said they were just so-so.  Nothing special.  They should have gotten the soup!\n\nThen, we all ordered the ravioli except for my brother who must have loved the gnocchi as much as I did and he got that.  We were all suprised he didn't go for a meat dish - he's usually a pretty big eater.  \n\nThe ravioli were just like the gnocchi - light and just perfect - in a cream and tomato sauce.  \n\nFor dessert, my sister-in-law picked the creme brulee.  It was a good size, with sliced strawberries on top.  Our waiter brought it out with a candle on top and it ended up being free (nice touch from the restaurant).  It was very good. \n\nAnd the little shots of flaming sambuca (black licorice flavored liquor) at the end is a nice and fun touch, too.\n\nThe service was excellent as well.  \n\nThe atmosphere is fine - very cozy, dim lighting and traditional with white table cloths, etc.  The decor is a pretty outdated but I've seen worse.  It wouldn't deter me from coming back.  But, I would probably go even more if it was updated.\n\nI'm so excited to have found it - my new favorite Italian place - and really reasonable prices, too.",1
"First of all, everything in Arizona closes hella early, so as a last resort at about 9 o'clock we went to this fancy schmancy joint for dinner. Little did we know that the food would not be as up to scale as the dimly lit decorations. My sister and I got chicken Cesar salads with chicken that was very dry and seemed and tasted like end of the day scraps. Also my brother-in-law's salmon and muscles tasted like sea water which resulted in bubble guts later that night. On top of all this, Tutti Santi is also pretty pricey. $15 for a minuscule could-have-been-rat-for-all-we-know Cesar salad. Good luck dinner goers.",0
"What a great find! We purchased a deal chicken for this restaurant as we had never tried before. We had an absolutely fabulous dinner start to finish. We started with Caprese salad and stuffed mushrooms both were very good, then for entrees, we had Chicken florentina and Pasta romantico. Both sauces were the best we have had! The atmosphere is like you are in Italy. I would have never figured from the location but we will be regulars.",1
"Had dinner here tonight with my husband, who had eaten here previously. The decor is old style Italian, and the food is amazing. I had the snapper and it was superb. It was served with linguini in a red sauce that had a slight kick. Pasta was perfectly prepared. My husband had the orange roughy which was in lemon caper sauce and was delicious, neither of us had eaten roughy before and we were pleasantly surprised. The desserts were traditional Italian desserts, so we decided to share a canoli, which was a great choice. The shell was crisp rather than soggy as some cannoli's can be. The filling had a hint of sambuca flavor. The only thing missing were the chocolate chips. Delicious meal and very attentive service, we would definitely go back. I would recommend calling for reservations as it is not too big a place and fills up quickly.",1
"Amazing food, amazing service, great atmosphere ! Always have an enjoyable experience every time we dine here.",1
I love Tutti Santi on 16th St! The service is always top-notch. The setting is authentic Italian. It is the one place in town where I can get orange roughy-my favorite fish. It is prepared in the most divine lemon/caper sauce with artichoke hearts-truly spectacular. I love the flaming Sambuca at the end of the meal.,1
"Stopped by after a Pilates class in that strip mall and was so pleasantly surprised by this unassuming restaurant. Great service and they were happy to cater to our picky dietary requests. I had a sea bass special and replaced the linguine w perfectly steamed veggies. Delicious. A nice and reasonably priced italian Pinot noir and a complimentary after dinner drink. Oh, and did I mention the garlic bread? Perfection. My friends had a chicken and mushroom dish and a penne dish. Even the caprese salad was special enough to pack up the leftovers. I will definitely be back.",1
"\""""Great food and service. Would be good to have a kids menus to make it 5 stars.",1
Can't review the food as we didn't stay long enough to order. We were there for dinner on a Friday evening and the place was empty.  My wife smelled Pine Sol and stale smoke as we got to our table.  We felt it better to go elsewhere. I've been to the one in Scottsdale on 90th St and it was great.,0
"The entire experience was exceptional.  I travel a lot for work and try new places and gamble on a great experience. Let me tell you, this place was a winner.  The host was awesome from when I walked in, the service was awesome.  Not to mention the food, it was perfect.  I tried a variety of appetizers, the lasagna OMG delicious! And ravioli is to die for.... Dessert was great and had a surprise from our server, a flaming shot a some Dort of liquor with coffee beans inside.  A truly great experience, this is my first review but every time I get to Phoenix this is my first choice for dinner always.  Love this place",1
"This restaurant was recommended by the hotel staff where we stayed while out of town. The place was packed and seemed like it was worth the wait. The food was delicious and everyone at our table  enjoyed their meal. Nina, the owner, greeted all the guests and was lovely. Great meal and ambiance. We liked it so much we went back the next night!!",1
"Wonderful food and service. Vincent was awesome.  May be the best Italian we've ever had.  We had the gnocchi, sirloin lasagna, sea bass/calamari/shrimp special. \n\nFound on yelp and trusted the reviews. You should do the same.  I guarantee you will not be disappointed.",1
I would say everything was okay.  Nothing special.  The service was a little awkward. We would have different people showing up at the table asking if we had been served our salad or if we needed anything. That is nice but to have to answer it over and over to different people got old.\nPast the time I thought we should have been served they came by to tell us that they were out of one of the dished we ordered. They asked us to let them know what else we would like.  We had to ask them for a menu to help decide. They guy brought us a menu and disappeared.  I flagged down the next available employee and told them what we wanted. \nThe food was fine. My son got the red snapper as an alternative. It was very mediocre.,0
"I have been coming here with my family since it opened, years ago. The food is consistently good. All of their pasta dishes are excellent. If you like soups like the kind served in fine dining, they are known for their excellent soups of all kinds,  particularly their lentil vegetable, stratetella soup, and minestrone.  On rare occasions they have Osso Bucco roasted veal lamb shank. It is superb.  If you are unsure what to try first on the menu, be sure to order the Penne Bolognese.",1
We ate  there last night- we are vegetarians and had the ravioli and the eggplant parm. Both were delicious! We had Tiramisu for dessert and it was great!  Our server was attentive but not intrusive.\nWe will go back!,1
"I was craving Italian food while on an anniversary trip with my husband.  Decided to try this place since it was within walking distance of our resort.  Glad we did!  I had the ravioli, which was not what I intended on having, but I'm glad I did.  I normally steer clear of anything with ricotta cheese but decided to go for it.  The ravioli was homemade with ricotta cheese and spinach.  It had a mixture of white and red sauce and was delicious.  The sauce was just enough to cover the ravioli but not over-bearing.  The hubs had the chicken florentine and it was also very good. I'm not exactly sure what kind of sauce it had but it tasted like a wine sauce of sorts.  It came with two decent sized chicken breasts covered in spinach and topped with sauce with a side of penne pasta that had what I assume was a tomato-type sauce.  Very good!  They provide you with a basket full of delicious and plentiful garlic bread.  The service was great and the atmosphere was very nice.  It's located in the corner of a strip mall.  We wore jeans with nice shirts, I saw some people in shorts and others were dressed pretty nice...dresses, collared shirts, etc.  If you're looking for good, authentic Italian food, this is the place!!",1
"Honestly this is the best Italian food I've ever had. The only bummer is that it's ruined Italian food for anywhere else I go.  Pretty much anything you order is incredible. The ravioli and eggplant parmesan are my 2 favorites and my husband loves the lamb. Whenever we do go out for Italian, it's only to Tutti Santi.",1
"One of the masseuses nearby gave us this place as a recommendation for dinner over the weekend. WOW was it delish! I got the Chicken Imperiale and my friend got the homemade ravioli. Both dishes were incredible. Our server Marco was lovely (anyone who calls me \""""bella\"""" is :) ). \n\nTutti Santi is tucked away in a corner in the small strip area at North 16th Street and Morten, near the Hilton Squaw Peak. I get my nails done in here and somehow had never noticed this quaint restaurant. \n\nI can't wait to come back!",1
"Amazing Chicken Fiorentina and the Agnello is their lamb shank where the meat fell off the bone. Great time with friends and Sambuca after completed the night. If you ever been to Italy, this was home.",1
"My friend and I ate at the other location in Scottsdale just a few nights ago. We were not very hungry and shared that gnocchi and ravioli and it was amazing.\n\nSince we both love Italian food we came back for more at the location in Phoenix.   I loved the homemade gnocchi so much I had to order it again. It is made with a cream sauce and has a touch of red sauce on top. For being a slightly more filling type of pasta the cream sauce is perfect. It's light and flavorful without being to heavy. The red sauce is very delicious too. \n\nI personally am not a seafood fan; however, my friend ordered the seafood linguine and she loved it. She said that there was an amazing amount of seafood in it. She was able to fill up on essentially just the seafood and only had a small portion of the linguine. She did also loved the flavor of the pasta.\n\nPrior to the meal you receive a basket of bread that has been warmed with olive oil and fresh minced garlic. Yum!\n\nUpon reading other peoples reviews of the house salad...we knew to anticipate lettuce and tomato with a balsamic dressing. Although it is a very basic salad the flavors are still amazing. The tomato has a balsamic vinaigrette dressing with small bits of basil. I chopped up part of my tomato and placed on the garlic bread and made a small bruschetta :) also added some of the Parmesan to the salad! I'm not a big fan of salad in general and it was very enjoyable to me. \n\nWe ended our meal with dessert. Although we both like Tiramisu...we love cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e even more. There cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e was very good with a perfectly toasted top and a smooth and creamy custard. It had it diced strawberries on top too.\n\nAnother thing that made this restaurant  amazing, was our server. He was kind, friendly, attentive, energetic, and fun. He definitely made our dining experience better. The great thing about this restaurant is you can order what you want and the food will be good.\n\nWe finished the night here with a flaming Sambuca shot.  This was really fun and on the house!! Did I mention that our server was AMAZING!!! \n\nIf I lived in this area I would eat at this restaurant all the time. it puts chain Italian restaurants to shame!  If I'm ever back in this area I will have to return here. I hope you try it out and have a great experience like we did!",1
decent donuts but horrible coffee....,0
"There are seriously some mornings in my house where my family will look at eachother ...say, \""""Donuts?\"""" and we all magically know that this donut craving can't be satiated by simply Dunkin. Though these mornings are few and far between because my family has more of a convenience over quality attitude, they do occur. \n\nMy mother discovered Rainbow donuts because she works in Phoenix and before Dunkin had its viral takeover of Arizona, it was the only place to get donuts on the way to the office.\n\nAs far as donuts go I honestly don't think there's a way that Rainbows donuts could be any better. Maybe if they were covered in diamonds and had reverse calories. Everything they have tastes fresh even if it's bought at closing time. The prices are so cheap that I wonder how they even stay in business. The employees are always super friendly. \n\nConvert your donut religion to Rainbow donuts today. See the light. Repent!",1
Love these donuts! I can never buy just one donut because they all look Sooooo good! Needs a shop in the East valley.,1
"Two words: Texas Kalaches. Haha! We also tried the Maple Bacon Donut and it was surprisingly good (I couldn't eat a whole one, but its good!). I wish it wasn't so far away, though!",1
"This place is pretty good. Definitely beats dunkin and it has almost a cult like following with one of my dental professors. \""""Students, today we are graced with a special treat. Do not be ashamed to eat these donuts. They stand above the rest.\"""" Good? Yes. Enough to make an impact. Not dying to go back right now but then again I just finished eating the following (I probably should not think about eating for a while)\n\n-Glazed french cruller:  best of that variety I have ever had. It completely melted in my mouth. \n-Glazed donut hole: unremarkable\n-Sprinkled vanilla cake:  not a fan but I am a yeast girl at heart\n-Cherry frosted cake: quite good but never would have guessed was cherry flavored had I not checked the website\n-Buttermilk: rich, decadent, dreamy. I had never tried buttermilk before, but if you are looking for a donut that makes an impact, this is it.  \n\nThe buttermilk and french cruller would be my go to donuts next round but I want to try more....the apple fritter, raspberry jelly filled...so many donuts, too little time",1
Tasty donuts in a convenient location. I've had their coffee rolls and other regular donuts and all of them are good.,1
"On a whim while missing home, I did a Yelp search for Texas Kolaches and Rainbow Donuts is what I got.  It's not close to my house, being in Phoenix, but luckily, it is close to my new job.  I don't make it up here nearly often enough, but when I do, it's always worth it!  \nNot only are they the only place in Phoenix with Texas Kolaches (that sign isn't lying...I can't find them anywhere else), they also have a huge selection of donuts!  \nMy personal favorites are the spicy sausage kolache and chocolate frosted buttermilk donuts.  I've tried the bacon maple donut, and it was good, but it really needed more bacon (is there such a thing as ever enough bacon?).  Other winners are of course, the sprinkle donut, the cake donuts, and some kind of chocolate cake donut with a honey glaze.  Really, I don't think I've ever had a bad donut here.  \nThe woman behind the counter is always friendly and patient with me as I take forever deciding what I want (I always go in for 1 or 2 and come out with 6 or 7).  \nThere are a few Rainbow Donuts sprinkled around town, but they're all independently owned.  I've never tried the others, so just to be safe, you better just come to this one.  :)",1
Great you just have to get there on Sunday before early church gets out its a great shop and great service will be returning soon,1
"I live nowhere near here (thank God!) but have had their donuts from co-workers bringing them in and have been in store. I recently tried the Texas kolache, which is a breaded sausage and cheese pastry. You can get it spicy or not, I chose for the not spicy warmed up. It was delicious! As far as donuts, their glazed is addicting. I also got an iced chai, which was very flavorful and delicious. Restaurant inside has bar seating and a few tables. Staff is also really friendly. Overall winner here!!",1
"Got in line with my daughter when we observed the lady in front of us returning a few donuts. Expecting the donuts to go in the trash per food regulation, I walked out after seeing them being placed back with the other donuts to be sold (again).",0
"If I could give a negative rating I would. With that said If you have to go here then go but...\n\nA little over a year ago I had to go to the ER and after waiting for over two hours when there was no body in front of me and it was early and not busy I finally got seen by a doctor for like two minutes who was rude and then I never saw him again. \n\nI had a lady come in and mop my room while the nurse was putting in an IV in my arm!!! Uhhh, hello, do you think could have maybe come back a little later?\n\nI had another nurse who was there to take my blood pressure info just leave the machine on and it beeped for the next 15 mins until finally in all my pain (I later found out I had a kidney stone) I got up and asked someone to turn it off. \n\nMy nurse wouldn't give me any information about what the tests I was getting were for. The room was 71 degrees and I had to ask 3 different people for a warm blanket even AFTER my boyfriend called the nurses station from work to get them to bring me one. \n\nThe place seemed dirty and unsanitary, I mean I guess it was due to all the construction they had to wheel me through but even that was ridiculous. Oh yeah I almost forgot to mention the left over sticky things, the ones that they use to connect your heart to machines, in my gown that I noticed. I was never hooked to a heart machine... That means they were who ever had the gown on before I did. That's gross!.\n\nThen I had to deal with all the payment info and not one person I talked to yet has been helpful. They all seem to be \""""busy\"""" and rude and they act like I'm bugging them for calling the 800 number to get my payments squared away. Ugh! \n\nNow, I have to deal with the billing folks again. Why, you ask? Oh because they decided not to send me my last bill and even after talking to mulitple people asking them to send me a bill to my new address and them agreeing to. I guess it was just easier to put my bill into collections. Thanks JCL! You guys are swell folks. So today I call in asking to see if we can get this fixed. That I WANT to pay my bill. That I had no intention of not paying it. That there was no reason for it to go into collections. Pat (the lady I spoke to) was no help, so I asked to talk to a supervisor or manager. She put me on hold for about 8 mins and then some how the phone call got disconnected (nice). So I called back, she didn't answer so I left a message. That was at 8am it's now 6pm and no phone call back. Geez that's great customer service.\n\nIf you have to go then go but if you can hold out for a better hospital then I recommend the extra driving in the end it will be less of a headache.",0
"My date can't get enough of my cooking skills, so I agreed to make him dinner at my place one night. I had everything set up very nicely, and the food was shaping up to be superb. I was planning on a spinach salad, shrimp marinara, and coffee cake for dessert. \n\nAll of my dishes were coming out seamlessly until I pulled out a crystal platter to add ambiance to the coffee cake. The platter shattered in my hands just as the doorbell rang. I looked at the crystal on the floor and the blood gushing out of my hands, and I went to answer the door. \""""I had an accident\"""" was the first thing out of my mouth. \n\nAfter my date cleaned up the blood trail, he took me to the emergency room at John C. Lincoln. Even though it was a Saturday night I got right in to see a doctor. \n\nThe staff was so attentive, and the PA discussed all of my options for anesthesia and sutures. I was in and out two hours and four stitches later. And thanks to the awesome staff the pain was never too much to handle!",1
"I was really irritated with this place.  I called up prior to heading over for a problem with my wife to check on ER wait times.  The woman on the phone was extermely rude.  She told me she could not give me that kind of information.  When I followed up with 'Is there alot of people waiting?' I received the same answer, just with more attitude.  \n\nI followed up with an additional question about insurance.  After being transfered to admissions or billing (?), someone who should know, asking the question again, a non-answer was for some reason rudely given. \""""We bill all insurances\"""".  OK, thats great, are you an in-network provider for my insurance?  \""""I can't answer that question!\"""" ...CLICK!  She hung up on me!\n\nI would give it less stars, but I really don't know how the medical staff actually is.  Support staff needs wrk!",0
"We ended up in JCL's ER on Christmas Eve night, 2000 miles away from home. Everyone from the front desk to the doctor couldn't have been kinder. They took wonderful care of my wife, apologized for the chilly weather - we kept assuring them that it was 25 degrees colder in Detroit - and made sure that we were out of the hospital before midnight.\n\nI'm sure the employees couldn't have been all that excited about working on Christmas Eve, but they were all incredibly kind. We only wish we could have thanked everyone personally.",1
"Some of the rudest, uncaring most unprofessional people i have ever seen in my life. I can't believe they call themselves professionals. My husband has severe stomach pains every day, and this hospital is the closest from our home so we usually come here. That, and they know him well from being there so often. He actually had a nurse (brandi) tell him \""""why are you moving around so much, it can't hurt that bad\"""" Can you believe that! And \""""no one can die from pain\"""" WHAT! They won't admit him because according to their standard ER tests he's in perfect health. They honestly think of him as someone who's only there to get his \""""fix\"""". I hear then laughing, socializing, and planning their weekends in the hallways. Meanwhile, my husband is laying there dying and screaming in pain. I wish i could give them a negative rating. DON'T COME HERE, GO ANYWHERE ELSE!\nOn the other hand, if you have a sick child, Mendys place is amazing!",0
Had to take my son to mendy's place for some breathing problems. The doctor was okay but the nurses and respiratory therapists were fantastic!,1
Went into ER with abdominal pain left there five days later after unexpected surgery. Every person I encountered were kind and helpful and professional. The exceptional care helped make my unexpected stay more pleasant than I thought a hospital stay could be. Thank you to all the staff that treated me.,1
I went to the emergency room at JCL with severe lower back pain and had a great experience! Everyone was very attentive and really listened! They took me directly to a private room and I got into a gown and laid down. The doctor came in and took time to talk to me and examined me. Gave me three choices. I had a CT scan to take away my worries. I decided to get a muscle relaxant and give it a few days...good decision. I went in at 5:30 am Sat morning and only spent a few hours at the hospital. Super nice people and environment!,1
"Emergency room....BAD experience twice in 3 yrs...both times i was totally ignored in an empty ER...the first time I was ignored in the waiting room for over 8hrs, i left and was not billed...the recent i was ignored for over 3 hrs...charged for seeing a \""""Doctor\"""" that i never saw...sat in a room...was brought NOTHING for my pain...i admit i had one nurse stick her head in the door and tell me she was sorry i had to wait so long, she drew blood then left, i never saw her again...then i sat again...finally got up, got dressed, flagged down someone in the hallway to let them know i was leaving, and then was presented with a bill that was outrageous for the service performed(or lack of)\nwouldn't go there if my life depended on it",0
"In phoenix on a business trip I woke up at 1am with stabbing abdominal pain. I came in to the ER and was seen immediately. RN Beverly G was friendly, knowledgeable, and sociable and really helped me feel at ease... which isn't the easiest thing at 4am while exhausted, in awful pain, and pantsless.\n\nEveryone I felt with was professional with a good sense of humor, and made the several hour stay go by quickly. They never left me alone longer than 30 minutes at the longest and kept me updated on my situation and test results constantly.\n\nI only wish they were near home, because it was a far better experience than any I've found in Denver!",1
"I was having chest pains and not feeling well at all and had my husband drive me to the hospital on 7/28/13.  I provided my insurance information and waited in the waiting area.  Two men came out and gave me an EKG right there and told me my heart was normal and I could wait.  After about 40 minutes I was taken to a room.  My nurse was fantastic.  She kept me informed.  The doctor sucked!  He was confused and seemed to be walking in circles.  The nurse had taken blood, then gave me 4 asprin and then they were going to take my blood again in 2 hours.  During this time the doctor popped in and said \""""you ready to go\"""".  The nurse said, no we're waiting 2 hours for more blood.  After laying there for 5 hours, the doctor came in and said they found nothing and follow up with my physician.  I wasn't happy and I was still feeling terrible.  Then imagine my surprise when I received a bill from the doctor for $1557 because he was out of network and my insurance didn't cover it.  I was pissed!  I called the hospital and ripped them.  They claim that I signed a document that disclosed this information.  I explained I had been to this hospital at least 4 times over the 12 year period I've lived in the neighborhood.  The rep told me I should have asked if the doctor was a contractor and asked for a different doctor.  I won't be paying this doctor.  And I'm filing a complaint with my insurance company against this medical group for false advertising.",0
"Been here 3x, twice for myself and once for my daughter.  Place is clean, staff is friendly and efficient I have zero complaints and would definitely come back if another situation came up.",1
"Waiting in ER for over 2 hours with a son that has a severe migraine.  Watching people being brought back to see a doctor who have just walked in. When we questioned why we have not been seen yet,  was advised that those people were sicker than my son. The people that were brought back looked perfectly fine, none were in pain or looked injured. My opinion is the type of insurance they have, depends on the type of care you get here. People are leaving before being seen because people who came after are being seen before them.  This is pathetic way of treating people. The only reason we are here is because my son's doctor told him to come if his headache got worse.   So just remember if you get sick and can't get into your doctor till the next day. DONT come here,  you have a better chance waiting for your doctor.  You could drop dead in the waiting room.",0
"Very disappointed in the customer service with this hospital!!  Please make sure you check your bill before paying it!  They charged me $201 for an IV which I didn't get.  I spent countless hours telling customer service that I didn't receive any needles in my arm.  Then she told me that an audit was run on my account and that my last medication was indeed an injection!!  Again, I told them I didn't receive any needles in my arm and that all medication was given orally.  After several weeks with countless emails and phone conversations the director finally spoke with the nurse who admitted to making an error.  I wish all of this could have been resolved from day 1.",0
"So much for the Starbuck's coffee at Veranda. As of this week they've replaced it with some wimpy Folger's-syle stuff. Humpf. I guess everybody is trying to cut costs in this economy, but they've just eliminated the main draw for me in the morning. because my office lunchroom coffee tastes better than their new stuff. Woe is me...",0
"It's better than nothing. \n\nIf you work in the area (16th and Morton) and have a limited amount of time for lunch, or if you didn't have time to eat breakfast in the morning the Veranda Bistro is for you. You will be completely not-excited-but-not-disappointed by this exactly as expected food. \n\nThe breakfast menu is essentially 4 ingredients (egg, meat, cheese, starch) served in several varieties. They all pretty much taste the same. One warning, the home fries are typically undercooked. The eggs have an amazing characteristic, that being the ability to crumble into a pile of bits too tiny to be picked up with a fork. I sense some breakfast fairy magic at play. \n\nLunchtime is a bit better, with several sandwich options, both cold and hot. There are salads and soup, and a variety of deep fried snacks. I've eaten a few of the cold sandwiches, and they are moderately tasty. The salads are premade and sitting in a cooler, which makes for some drippy lettuce. \n\nSpeaking of lettuce, I would love to meet the monster that's strong enough to cram THAT MUCH lettuce into one container. I'm not exaggerating when I say I pulled off enough lettuce to make two more salads of equal size. No one in this world needs that much lettuce in one sitting. \n\nVeranda Bistro serves a valuable purpose and is blessed with a great location. It's the only restaurant within walking distance for a few thousand people. I only wish that they tried a little harder rather than delivering exactly what I expected. Curse my low expectations!",0
"The service was horrible, the breakfast menu only had 4 basic ingredients, and the employees could not understand what we were asking, most likely due to a language barrier. The eggs and bacon were just bad. I would rather have gone to mcdonalds honestly. The food was put in styrofoam boxes even though we planned on dining in. I was hoping to have a nice morning breakfast with my boyfriend, but this place just did not live up to the appearance given by the website. \n\nI will give them that their frappes were good, but that was about it. They were about the same price as starbucks. \n\nOverall, it was a horrible experience. If your in the area and want breakfast just go get an egg mcmuffin at mcdonalds down the street, it has more flavor and they have better coffee.",0
"I went in recently and had a Panda bowl, which consisted of noodles and orange chicken.\n\nIt must have been a bad batch, but the orange chicken was somewhat burnt, over cooked, and crunchy.\n\nI might give them another chance in the future.",0
I love Panda and this is one of my most favorite fast food restaurants in Phoenix. I love the way they cook their orange chicken. It tastes so good. Even I am not hungry I can buy a bowl and finish it off. I think their orange chicken is the best and after that honey walnut shrimp. \n\nThe store is clean and I have never had any problem with them.,1
"Hit or miss. You have to be there at lunch or dinner rush to get fresh food that hasn't sat and dried out all day. They will usually make fresh food for you if you ask and are wiling to wait, so that's a plus. The fact that you HAVE to ask is NOT a plus, because they do not have a problem giving you a dried out nasty scoop of yuck if that's all that's in the pan. \n\nAll of the negative reviews do not surprise me. I once found a piece of broken glass in my Beijing Beef, about the size of a grain of rice. Nearly ate it but felt it at the last second. \n\nThat being said, it's a long steam table in a cruddy shopping plaza.  I'm not expecting gourmet food here. I am usually happy with what I get, especially if I get them when stuff is fresh. It is what it is.",0
"Ordered both types (regular and Sicilian) of pizzas they have and both of them were almost too bad to eat.  I'll be throwing the leftovers away. The Sicilian was greasy and bland, the regular was bland and chewy.  Now, there lasagna and subs and such may be good... but the pizza was not.  If you're still interested.. they do have a website:\n\nhttp://www.patspizzaplus.com/",0
I LOVE this pizza!  It's the best I have had in Phoenix.  Not the greatest atmosphere to sit down in.  Service is fine... but the pizza is awesome.,1
"Yelp totally led me wrong here!  This place is relatively inexpensive, but I didn't find the atmosphere charming or fun and the pizza tastes like something from a school cafeteria.  \n\nGranted, all I tried was one pizza but it really stood out as a place to avoid in a neighborhood with plenty of fantastic pizza and other Italian food.",0
"The pizza is really good. Just make sure you're on your A game - like other people have said, there are so. many. rules. I've never caught attitude from an employee, but they've got me terrified.",1
"I like Pat's Pizza Plus! \n\nIts not the best pizza I have ever had, but its not the worst either. Its just right there in the middle good pizza. \n\nThe crust is always perfect, that sauce is always delightful. I like to eat in and get a small side salad (while the salad is a bit lacking you get these glorious little rolls made from heaven) \n\nLike one yelp-er said, all the off putting signs are a bit much, but I have also witnessed the type of clientele that go in there and have been tempted a few times to bitch slap someone for their oblivious rudeness to the employees of Pat's.",1
"Quality control seems to have disappeared here.  The crust is a disaster these days... and they're really slow... 45 minutes is too long to wait for a casual, mom & pop pizza joint.",0
"This review is for the Sicilian Pizza, with Pepperoni, Sausage and Basil.  I have to say that I wasn't a fan of this pizza, but I prefer a thin crust pizza.  \n\nI still believe the reviews that Pat's Pizza Plus is tasty, and I will order from them again.  I just didn't care for this version of pizza.  \n\nIf you like Chicago-style pizza, you may enjoy this sort of pie.  I would have liked it better if the crust was thinner and had more sauce, but then again, it wouldn't have been the Sicilian-Style pizza.\n\nI will update my review as I try other pies.",0
"Nice guys, but that doesn't help the pizza taste any better. The slices are reheated in their oven before being served to you, the crust is rock-hard and has a bit of a cardboard taste and their sauce and cheese lack flavor. The portion size is decent, but large portions of subpar food is just more subpar food. Disappointed in the quality, and the fact that they charge you for refills of your drink and nickel and dime you for a small, pre-measured, and awful tasting side of ranch dressing, or other condiment. Not impressed, nor a fan. :-(",0
Not only is the pizza scrumptious their service is great. Pats isn't a chain so it is like a homey pizza haven in Boston. An adorable little shop where you can break bread with sauce and cheese and feel content. Pats Pizza Plus is an outstanding pizza shop that me and my family love!,1
"ORIGINAL REVIEW (updates below)\n\nThis place is everything you want in a neighborhood Italian restaurant: family-owned, decent, if not giant portions, it's TERRIFIC!\n\nThree or four times I've ordered a large Pat's Deluxe.  Pat's Deluxe is a large (I would call this an 18\"""" pizza.  It's really large) thin crust with your choice of 6 items.  I'm a sausage, mushroom and onion kind of gal, with extra sauce and this is like 4 meals!\n\nGreat flavor, the sauce could be a bit bolder, spicier?, but it's a damn good pizza!  And a damned good value, too.\n\n(If a Costco large pie is $10.84, and it is, for a deluxe, pepperoni OR cheese, to spend $20 on a pizza there's gotta be a reason.  Pat's Pizza Plus is one of those reasons.  Go ahead.  Splurge!  This is a good pizza pie!)\n\n8/12/12:\n\nTwo more pizzas since my last:  DELICIOUS!  You get a large (I would call this an 18\"""" pizza. It's really large)  thin crust with your choice of 6 items.  SIX ITEMS!!!!\n\nYOU order what you WANT BUT IM GOING BACK FOR THE PATS PLUS\n\nDelicousjjjjjjj\n\nupdate: 12/15/12\n\nStopped in for lunch intending to buy their lunch special 2 slices and a coke for, I think, $3 (but I could be wrong).  I ended up with an 12 inch Italian sausage sandwich with onions and peppers.  OH MY GOOD GAWD!   THIS IS A GREAT SANDWICH.\n\nSo, let's review: great thin crust pizza, great lunch special, great, great hot Italian sub.   This is a terrific spot!",1
"Good little local pizza place.  We got the Twin Tower special which was a 16\"""" 2 topping pizza and 30 wings for 23 bucks.  What was amazing was this pizza was a huge square and a full 16\"""" .. We opted for the thick crust which I really wasn't crazy about but I'm sure many people would love..it was more of a crunchy toasted kinda crust.  Wings were really good and service was very friendly and attentive. I would go back to try the thin crust and some of their specialty pizzas.",1
"It was my boyfriends birthday and we were trying to find a new pizza place worthy of us not going to oreganos anymore. And after reading all these reviews, Im wondering if I just went on a bad night? But good restaurants shouldnt have \""""bad nights\"""" right? Aside from the friendly service over the phone, nothing was worth going back for. My bf is a huge ricotta fan so I decided to order the ny white pizza and some garlic bread. The gentleman over the phone told me 25min and I showed up in 20. Everything was ready and I walked in and out within one minute. I shouldve known instantly that something wasnt right. One thing i love about oreganos is that they show you the pizza before you walk out. When i got in the car and looked at the pizza, the cheese was already crusted solid on top, showing that it had been sitting under a heater for maybe 10min or so. By the time I got home (a few blocks away), my pizza was room temperture, the cheese on top was rock hard and i couldnt taste ANYTHING but GARLIC GARLIC GARLIC. Super disappointing. Back to Oregano's we go....",0
Great NY style pizza and wings! My only complaint is that you can't order flats only. My honey and I only like flats so it kind of sucks but it's nice not having to have to order extra crispy wings and still not get soggy wings!\n\nUpdate: We've now been able to order flats only.,1
"I have had this in my \""""to try\"""" list for a long time... not really long enough :(\n\nI stopped in for a lunch special...2 slices and a drink for like $4.00 or so... BUT they only accept debit over $5.00 Then make the damn special $5 bucks! I had to add a third slice just so I could eat there. LAME\n\nThe pizza was thin, no sauce and topped nice with cheese. The entire thing was flavorless. NONE not the sauce or the crust. \n\nThe service was all over the place (not in a good way) the building was roasting hot, and there was an old guy with his Pee Bag hanging out there while eating. (no stars deducted for that)\n\nOver all... I doubt I would be back.",0
"We always try to find a local business to support and found good reviews on yelp for Pat's Pizza Plus. Geez. I have no idea where the good reviews came from. The pizza had zero sauce on it, it was lukewarm upon pick-up and the salad was being stored on top of the pizza so it was lukewarm as well. We won't be trying this place again. We'll stick with Spinato's!",0
"Meh.pizza was super greasy,cheese was gummy,crust was bland. $60 bucks for 2 pizzas and 24 wings not a good deal at all. Pat's seems to be a staple in the neighborhood but there are wayyyyy better places within a 1 mile radius. Since stumpy's was closed on Sunday we had to resort to Pat's. Never again!",0
"10/15/2013: Not going back. Ever. \n\nHere's how I rate a pizza: is it better the 2nd day?  Well, I've got good news and bad news.  First, the bad news:\n\nI've visited Pat's Pizza about 20 times in the past year (12 St and Glendale Ave, Phoenix) and the food is good.  Not great, good.  A good value, or so I thought.  But CERTAINLY NOT BETTER THE 2ND DAY!\n\nBut that's not the bad news. The bad news is, I called in an order one night a few weeks ago, and they emphasized that they close at 9 and that I'd have to absolutely be there by 9.  No problem.  But then the guy, with the broad bitching in the background (and I'm not joking), reiterated - AGAIN! That I HAD to be there by 9pm.\n\n I got there at precisely 8:54pm, but was horrified to realize, in my haste to \""""get there by 9pm-NO LATER!, I'd forgotten my wallet.  Sheesh.  Wasn't intentional.\n\nBut you should have seen, actually seen, the look of horror and disgust on the faces of these two schlubs.  After numerous visits, this guy knew me; the point is, I'm not hustling anyone, if I say I'll come back, I will.\n\nThere was not a hint of empathy, \""""it's ok, catch me later\"""", nothing.  Nothing for a regular customer, which is what I was.  I looked at the guy and said something like, \""""Well, if I HAD to be here by 9, I guess there's no chance I can go home and get my wallet\"""".  Again, looks of disgust.  Silence.  Disgusted slience.   So I said, \""""It's ok.  It's my mistake.  And I'll never come back\"""".  And I left.\n\nBut the good news is, because Pat's wouldn't trust me, allow me to pay later for the pizza, I was forced to find a new place...and I did!\n\nThat's how I found Raffaele's Pizzeria, 7019 N 19th Ave (NE corner, 19th Avenue and Glendale). This is terrific pizza and it's better the 2nd day.  I'll write a separate review for Raffaele's but know that now, for sure, I really never will go back to Pat's.  Assholes just had to get out of there by 9...\n\nWay to go Pat's.  How many customers do you have that come in 20 times in 6 months?  I hope you're happy.  I hope you're happy with that horrible woman who looked so disgusted that night.  I hope you're married to that horrible woman.\n\nI just wonder what they did with my pizza...",0
"Decent pizza and wings, not enough though to go back for a second time and deal with their award winning customer service. They nickel and dime you for any little request, I'm surprised he doesn't charge for the use of napkins.... Maybe that's next.",0
"I brought a pepperoni pie home from Pat's once and it was completely forgettable. The sauce was average and, like the cheese, not plentiful enough. It wasn't any better cold the next day.",0
"I hadn't tried Pat's in a while so my boyfriend and I decided to order it this last Saturday night. Unfortunately, it was awful. The sauce was missing!! It just tasted like dough. My boyfriend couldn't even finish it and he is not a picky eater. We will never try Pat's again, especially for the price. I recommend Stumpy's or NYPD. What a waste of money!",0
"My husband and his family have been coming here since 1982. We haven't been here in a few years so we decided to see if it was as great as  he remembered it to be. Well, we were very disappointed. It was not as good as he or I remembered. In the early 80's and 90's this place was good. The pizza was awesome and the inside of the restaurant had some charm. That is definitely not the case now. The pizza was extremely bland and not very flavorful at all. We decided to try the wings but backed out after trying the sauce. It was very vinegary. Seems like the quality of the food has changed and the inside is just like the pizza.......boring. After so many generations of eating at Pats, we will have to say goodbye.",0
"My wife went into to pick up some chemicals that our pool need and was mistreated and harassed because she had the nerve to pay with a debit card for a very small purchase.  Are you kidding me? I have spent hundreds of dollars at this store.\n\nI understand the costs businesses incur when running things as debit/credit, apparently B&L doesn't understand the cost they incur when mistreating customers.\n\nDo yourself a favor and and go to Perry's Pool and Pump.  They knowledgeable as well and will treat you with a bit more respect.  I am not willing to give my business to any store that mistreats their customers.\n\n*Update*\nThe reason why debit was an issue was because it was such a small amount, not because it was a debit card.  Stores pay a transaction fee and the fee was going to essentially cancel the actual payment made.  My wife and I generally don't carry cash on us.  The money a business would lose in this situation is more than offset by the purchases of mass chlorine, acid, and salt for our pool.\n\n*Important Update*\nMike from B&L contacted me to try and set things straight and get to the bottom of what happened.  That is a great indicator that they are trying to improve upon the customer service and are at least aware that in an age of social media, service needs to be top of mind for any business.  \n\nThat being said, I have no interest in going back.  Once you mistreat my wife, it is game over.  I hope others have a better experience.",0
"WORST SERVICE EVER!\n\nThe service is OK in the store, but NEVER call them for a repair! You probably will find  something better in Craiglist. Repair department is really unprofessional and unfriendly, their priority is send you a bill instead of customer satisfaction. You will find other reviews here stating the same, so save some time and money and call somebody else for repairs and try Costco or Online stores for supplies.",0
"Pool stores... never a place that you 'want' to go to.  The costs, the smells, the inadequate employees, the upsells.  Yet, if you're someone like me, who doesn't have a degree in pool maintenance, you're required to go to them.  \n\nI became a new homeowner in 2009, and I discovered this place wanting to get a second opinion on my pool water after Leslie's tried to upsell me on buying several different chemicals.  I took a water sample to B&L and they knew exactly what I needed, at the cheapest price, without giving me the runaround.  I've been coming to them ever since.\n\nThe staff is friendly... always greeting you, and offering you bottled water.  \n\nThey're very knowledgeable... I had a severe algae problem.  I gave them a pool water sample, they did the test, provided the chemicals needed, and walked me through the cleaning process.  My pool was clean and clear several days later!\n\nThey want to earn your business... Just bought a new cleaner from them several days ago on impulse, noticed it cheaper online, came to return it, but they offered to price match for me and credited me the difference.  Now that's loyalty!\n\nOnly reason I didn't rate them 5 stars: There's times when customer traffic is busy, and you'll have to wait for assistance.  I try to visit them during the weekdays though.  Also, not a fan of the aesthetics, as it's a maze trying to walk through their store... yet, I'm slightly OCD (or so I think).\n\nIf you need pool products at a reduced cost (they periodically send me coupons), with great customer service, I highly recommend B&L.",1
"Blue Saguaro has been doing the same menu of breakfast sandwiches (seriously delicious - toasted sourdough drenched in salty butter, egg over medium, crispy bacon and melty American but not Kraft cheese) and lunch sandwiches & salads for over 10 years.    There's a reason that it hasn't really changed:  It works. \n\nThe lunch menu has specialty vs regular sandwiches.   Most of the specialty are loaded up with sandwich fixings you're not going to get in a chain shop - cream cheese, sprouts, avocado that wasn't spread on thinner than mustard.   The bread is bakery quality and there's a decent selection.   The ambience is non existent, but when you're grabbing lunch on the run it really doesn't matter.     \n\nThey are super fast, but that may be because I always tip a buck.   :)",1
"This is the closest library to where I live but the selection inside is pretty dismal. It is a smaller library, so they have an even smaller selection of books. A while back this library seemed like it was going to close, so I signed a petition to keep it open. It must have worked, because it's still open and recently had some upgrades. Otherwise, it's an older brick building that's hidden away in a deteriorated neighborhood. I usually put the books I want on hold, so that when they arrive at the library I can go and pick them up in one swoop. I really like using the hold system online and feel like it's the easiest thing ever. I also like that they changed it recently, so now I can put 6 books on hold at a time - instead of just 3. I'm also grateful they are open until 7pm some nights, so I can go after work.",1

Her salon is stylish, clean and cozy.  I always look forward to my routine visits with Mary.  Keep up the good work!  See you soon.",1
"Never in my Yelp career have I started, saved, deleted and restarted a review more than I have this Bashas review. One would think \""""This is just a grocery store, why all the trouble?\""""\n\nBashas is more than just a grocery store; it is a facilitator. A facilitator of what we need as consumers to fuel our lives and contribute to our happy memories or to help us wash away the bad ones. \n\nBashas facilitated the best Champagne Sunday that ever existed. It has provided the chlorine that I so desperately needed so many times to keep my pool from going green. Here I found the curry paste that started my affinity for cooking. The cake that ended up all over my living room at my sister's 21st birthday? That's right: Bashas.\n\nSo many events and critical moments in our lives revolve around the tangible items we spend our hard earned cash on and we don't even realize it. We may complain about how long we have to stand in line or the fact that Bashas may be a tad more expensive than some other grocery stores, but we cannot deny that we need this Bashas. \n\nI need you, Bashas.",1
"I have been to this Bashas' a few times.. Two of the times we swore we would never go back. Once was when the manager was talking trash about an employee to the bagger that was right in front of us. The ENTIRE time we were checking out. He was so rude. The other time was when two employees were going on and on about their sex lives as they were checking us out. Pretty unprofessional if you ask me. The prices aren't too competitive, although I liked the Bashas in North Phoenix a lot when I lived there. It was worth the extra few dollars. But this one definitely is not. I would prefer Fresh and Easy, which is right across the street.",0
"I'm torn. They have great deals at times, like buy 1 get 2 free packages of boneless skinless chicken breasts. But they also have crappy bread and produce, last time I went there the strawberries I bought that looked fine rotted within a day, the tortillas all stuck together and the bread went moldy. I didn't save my receipt because I have never had to return anything to a grocery store before.. I guess I will limit my shopping to frozen foods or smoking deals.",0
"The only reason I go to Bashas is for the convenience. First of all make sure you have some extra time to run an errand there since you will be waiting in the checkout line. The checkout clerks are maybe a little outdated like the store itself. Oh and make sure you check expiration dates on the products. I bought some crackers for work and they were 6 months past the expiration date. Don't forget your Bashas card if you have one, they won't give you a courtesy swipe. 1 star because i can't give 0.",0
"Ugh. I don't like giving a tough review, but this is a store that needs to address a couple things.\n\n1. The Service: Long lines and unpleasant cashiers. \n2. Outdated Store: This wouldn't be so obvious if they just did a little cleanup and merchandising.\n3. Produce: Maybe in this store they should just no offer produce. The little corner in the store makes you think it was an afterthought. \n\nI think just a couple things that wouldn't cost much money would go a long way in making this store a go to place for me. Not there right now.",0
These people are phone spammers WHO WILL NOT STOP! They call several times a day from three different numbers all with the same area code and prefix but the last four numbers fall into three repeat patterns. The calls always come through as Adobe Carpet Cleaning. Based on the harassment from these people I will never be a customer. I don't care if their service is the best on earth and free. They have harassed me for three months and will not stop calling in spite of numerous requests to be taken off their call list.,0
Adobe carpet cleaning came to my home yesterday to clean my carpets and all I can say is WOW. They did an amazing job at a great price. My carpets were really dirty and now they look amazing. \n\nI would recommend them to anyone who needs their carpets cleaned,1
No matter how many times they call (nearly every day for the last few months!) and no matter how many times I tell them I am not interested and to please STOP CALLING - they continue to harass - calls come in from 8am until 9pm.  Based on these business practices alone I will never use them.,0
do not use these people.,0
"This company constantly harasses us by calling every week. We have told them to stop. 6027491677 is the number they call from. Their way of gaining customers is horrible. I honestly would get service from them when I need it, but now that they have bullied us with phone calls, I want nothing to do with their company.",0
Bad company. Do not use. Check negative reviews on BBB site and here on YELP.    Phone spammers of the worst kind. Also asked them to stop calling and they wont. What a way to upset potential customers. I will post my negative experience with them everywhere I can because of their bad practices.,0
"DO NOT USE. Unrelenting phone solicitation even after being told multiple times to stop, to put us on their OWN do not call list.  A complaint with the Federal Trade Commisssion is being filed, especially since our number has been on the list for over 31 days.  I encourage anyone who has had the same experience to do the same.  Go to the National Do Not Call Registry and file a complaint",0
"Adobe Carpet Cleaning is UNETHICAL and you should NEVER do business with them. We're on the FCC's \""""Do Not Call\"""" list, but Adobe Carpet Cleaning repeatedly breaks the law by calling us several times a week. They have done this for months even though we have politely asked them to stop, then angrily asked them to stop, then yelled at them to stop. Sometimes, they've called us three times a day, even harassing our young kids.\n\nNEVER USE ADOBE CARPET CLEANING.",0
"Got their LivingSocial Deal for 3 rooms. They arrived early and got started. Carpet came out great and even got rid of some old stains. Had to pay $3 for taxes. Only negative is I would have liked them to move the furniture, like the couch, to clean underneath. Friendly and helpful guys. Thanks.",1
"They said hey you've got 30 days to call to get your carpet recleaned, but guess what??? Nope these people suck in scheduling, communication and cleaning the carpet. Mine is still dirty and stinky. \nI do not recommend them!",0
"I should have read these reviews prior to hiring Adobe!  What a waste of money!  30 day guarantee forget that!  They called me to sell me their services after I was already displeased with the quality of their work from the week before. When I explained that I wasn't pleased the salesman was very polite and said that he was going to transfer me to a manager so that they can make things right.  When I spoke to the manager I explained to her that I was not happy with the work and that they didn't need to call me to sell me anything.  Instead of trying to resolve the cleaning issue she said, \""""I'll take you off the calling list.\""""  Then hung up.",0
"Hm, I sort of feel bad giving these guys such a low rating since they were rated so highly by the other reviewers. But honestly, I can't say I had a good experience there.\n\nI went to these guys based on a personal referral from a friend and b/c of the positive Yelp reviews.  I should have known better, since there were only 3 reviews, and my friend was new to Phoenix and went here because it was close to her home.\n\nAnyways, I have an older car and the check engine light came on.  I made an appointment, and when I show up, these guys wanted to charge me $98 to just diagnose the problem!!  I mean, most other shops do it for $20 or for free.  At that point, I didn't have much choice because I had already made elaborate arrangements for a friend to pick me up and I was getting worried about the check engine light.\n\nLong story short, they wanted to charge me a total of $750+ for repairs, labor, and parts.  I think their labor costs are way overpriced because I looked at what they wanted to charge for parts and it seemed more or less reasonable.  I buckled at the amount (mostly because I didn't have the cash) and because I wanted to get a second opinion after I learned that the check engine light costs $98 to check out. (I've since been to a Midas by my house who diagnosed the Check Engine light for FREE. And I've seen other places that do it for $20...still a chunk of cash compared to FREE but measly change compared to $98). \n\nNot knowing where to find a reliable mechanic for a second opinion, I took it to the dealership. I know that dealers usually charge higher prices that shops, so I was prepared for the worst.  But at least I wanted to know if the repairs suggested by Kelly Clark were legitimately needed.  Well, it turns out the repairs were really needed, but the shocker came when they quoted me a price of $550 for repair, parts, and labor.   That's a $200 price difference!!!!!  And I got the quote from a dealership too, who I know is probably charging more than normal. \n\nBottom line: Kelly Clark quoted me $750+ for repairs that my dealership did for $550.",0
"I read a review of how great they were. I took my truck there. EEKS, me thinks never again! I had an 8 am appointment for an oil change and head light problem. I waited for 2 hours and they didn't address the initial problem (the head light) until I reminded them at the time of payment. I clearly explained that I received a citation for having a head light out and I needed that looked at first. They reconnected the wire that had shaken loose and were shady in writing it on the receipt. I asked the guy to clarify on the receipt what was done and he blew me off by saying, we didn't do a repair. He refused to make that clarification on the receipt. This caused a problem when I went to the Paradise Valley court to prove I had the head light problem corrected. They are extremely overpriced and don't care about the customer.",0
"I came here today because I was on the 51 freeway and the front factory plastic ground effects under the front bumper finally broke off and was dragging on the freeway.  I pulled off and remember these guys being here years ago so I came in to see if they can pull it off completely for me real quick...otherwise I would keep driving to find another shop, ha ha.  Anyhow the guy at the counter took a whole 5 minutes to take care of me and did not even charge!!!  I tipped him $20 for the help since I would have gladly paid what ever they wanted since I was in a rush to an appointment.  These guys were GREAT!!!!",1
Went on their website and requested a callback 3 days ago. Still waiting for them to call.,0
Requested an in-home repair for a vertical blind. They advised that a technician would come on Friday Oct 17 between 8AM and 10 AM. He never showed up nor called to advise.\nI called again and the technician accused me that my phone does not work???????\nWhen I protested that he was wrong he got irate and told me that he would not come at all.\nGreat negative service!,0
"A long time ago, when I was in my twenties, and the Phoenix dining scene was barer than Lady Godiva, Carlos was a focal point for friends, co-workers and me. We'd get off our crappy little jobs, and gladly wait for a table to relish huge portions of \""""Mexican food\"""" dripping with cheese.  This was the 80's and we thought it was pretty wonderful.  \n\nA great deal has changed in twenty years. I've gotten older and crabbier. William Shatner is cool again. And the local restaurant scene has exploded with dazzling variety and quality.    \n\nWhen I escorted my mom here on a recent rainy day, a rush of distant memories streamed back from young adulthood. Nothing had changed here in two decades. The restaurant interior looked exactly as I had remembered. Young diners off work, more absorbed in office politics than in their massive taco salads and chimichangas - just like we used to be.  And my food looked and tasted remarkably like it did eons ago. \n\nNone of this, dear reader, is a good thing. \n\nCarlos O'Brien's, apparently stupified by its lucrative formula of white people phoning in bland Mexican food dripping with Monterey Jack, is stuck in a 1980's fern bar masking an even broader, unholier time warp.   The restaurant world has evolved, raised the bar, and it's abundantly clear nobody here gives a shit.  \n\nTo wit, I ordered fish tacos, which arrived, inexplicably, with no sauce or condiments of any kind. Just fish and dry cabbage in a tortilla?  To her credit, our waitress, who was perfectly pleasant, asked if I wanted any \""""sauce\"""".  Um, yeah. This high maintenance fussbudget also likes milk on his cornflakes and syrup on his goddam waffles; please go to the trouble of fetching me this delightful \""""sauce\"""" of yours.  \n \nWell it would be, if it resembled any fish taco sauce I've encountered since the Carter administration. Instead, our server cheerfully lugs back a ramekin brimming with industrial strength tarter sauce which, on this drizzly day, could have doubled as roof patch. \n\nI know what you're thinking. New waitress. I'm overreacting. Please bear with me. First,  she's not a new waitress. I overheard her gabbing with another table (friends of hers, I guess) about serving them on previous visits, so she's not new. This isnt about the waitress. \n\nSecond, I've never been served a dry fish taco in my life. No slaw dressing, not even a lime. Isnt this rather standard  preparation the kitchen's responsibility? \n\nThird, this is one of the half dozen lunch combos CB's been slinging in their sleep every weekday for thirty years. Could've been an oversight, but there's no misunderstanding about some off the wall request. \n\nFourth, why would our waitress immediately ask if I wanted \""""sauce\"""" unless she customarily served it  knowing the kitchen puts no sauce on the tacos? This isnt an oversight, it's business as usual.  \n\nI want to re-emphasize that our waitress was not difficult at all. I'm not panning Carlos because of any personality clash. I'm panning Carlos because they're so out of touch with diners' basic expectations  in 2008. I'm panning them because, on a corporate or management level (not a waitress or cook level), they dont give a crap about what comes out of their kitchen.  \n\nThere was a time when Carlos O'Brien's held Phoenix in the palm of their cheese encrusted hands, but this maturing culinary burg has passed them by.",0
"I love Yelp cause I can share my many experiences with you and the world. So today, in desperate need of a margarita, I decided to stop here with a couple of friends for a pitcher and some guacamole. After a few margaritas, I found their \""""healthy\"""" menu and decided to order their  \""""vegan\"""" veggie burrito. Problem was there was nothing vegan about it. After several bites of the burrito, I found a large piece of burnt steak inside. NASTY! If that wasn't enough, after consuming nearly half of the black beans it was served with, I found pieces of pork in the beans. That explains why they were so salty. I presented all of this to the manager who was kind enough to take most of everything, minus the booze, off of the bill. Revolting.",0
"If your are looking for any kind of flavor in your food , this is not the place for you. I had a green chili burro with rice and beans, it had to be one of the most bland meals I have ever had, this the place for those out of towners, You know the ones from those cold states, who are not familiar with what Mexican food should taste like. I have to say it is edible, you probably won't die, BUT DEFINATELY NOT ENJOYABLE, TASTEFUL, FLAVORFUL, OR MEMORABLE.\n This is not the place for true mexican food connoisseur. \n As for  the service it was average, not anything special.",0
"The food here gives a whole new meaning to the word bland.  That makes this an ok place because most anybody could eat what they serve without any complaints.  It is a good place to take a family or for a big eater.  You get food and lots of it.  It kind of makes me think of pigs when you see them at a feeding trough.  What they get may not be good, but they walk away full, happy piggys.  Carlos O'briens sends out lots of happy oinkers!\n\nDid you pick up on the subtle hint that this may not be the place for those who are looking for something special when they want to have Mexican food?  I hope (lol).\n\nI debated on two or three stars.  I wouldn't go back there myself-two stars.  If I had a family to feed or people from out of town who don't need to be impressed-three stars.  I'd rather be positive than negative so they get three.",0
"I wanted to take my sister out for dinner last night to celebrate her upcoming 21st birthday prior to going to see Cirque Du Soliel. We both love Mexican food and Carlos O'Brien's is literally within walking distance from my house. We used to go all the time as kids, but it has been years since I have been there last. \n\nI'm glad we gave it a try because we had a really great experience. We were seated immediately even though it was 5:45pm. We had friendly, attentive service from both our busser and our server.\n\nWe were served delicious, warm tortilla chips shortly after sitting with a tasty, fresh, and chunky salsa. They also provided the liquefied hot sauce, but I did not eat it because I do not like that kind at any restaurant.\n\nI decided on the veggie fajitas. The black beans are vegetarian, the refrieds are not. My sister selected the fajita quesedilla, sans meat.\n\nOur food arrived quickly and piping hot. Both of us had huge portion sizes and the food was extremely fresh and really tasty. They put a salty and slightly spicy seasoning on their fajitas, which come with a mixture of peppers, onions, squash, zucchini and potatoes. \n\nBack in the day when I used to eat meat (15+ years ago) I always ordered the shredded beef chimi. It was amazing. I would assume that it retains the same amazing taste and size as when I favored it as a child, but who knows.\n\nOur meal came to $21 and I gladly tipped our server over 20%! I will definitely be back when I have a cheat day on my diet!!",1
"I grew up eating at this place, going back to the days when it was on the corner of 16th and Bethany in the spot where TexAz is today.  I would say that this place is very dependable.  The food is solid, and it's a steal.  I had a machaca burro enchilada style with an iced tea, and it set me back about $10.  It is a real Phoenix institution.",1
Just ate a delcious Mexican pizza here.  It's so yummy!,1
I have been a Carlos'Briens fan for many years and having not been there for a while my better half and I decided to grab a quick bite at the bar last night. I really have nothing good to say about any part of our visit. Having been in the restaurant business myself I can be pretty forgiving when it is obvious that the place is understaffed and I am willing to be patient as long as it is acknowledged that I am sitting there waiting...instead we literally waited (at the bar) for 15 minutes without either one of the bartenders making so much as eye contact. I finally had to wave my arms before somebody said Hi. I was not the only one having this problem as both people to either side on me had been waiting longer than we had and a couple of the tables gave up and left. We finally placed our order of queso dip and a chimichanga with a bartender that was less than thrilled. The queso was really bad and chimi was mediocore at best. Nobody ever asked if there was an issue with the queso as the bowl was literally untouched. On the upside the chips and salsa are still good. We paid our tab and bailed. I made a quick stop to the restroom only to find it out of soap with the trashcan overflowing and paper towels all over the floor. All and all a very disappointing trip. Carlos O'Briens needs to make a serious effort to get their restaurant back to what it used to be.,0
"This isn't my favorite Mexican Place in the Phoenix area BUT it's Good!  I love their Tacos, Cheese Enchiladas, Chimi's and their Greenchili.   My friend and I love to order their quesadilla with Green Chili inside...  Their chips are always fresh and the salsa's are good too (I like to mix them together).  They have some tasty Margarita's as well.  I would recommend anyone to go to this restaurant.  On top of great food the service is also good!",1
"I've been going to Carlos O'Brien's since I was a child. It's one of the finest mexican food establishments in the valley!\n\nI admit that I am in a perpetual rut with regards to their dishes; I never eat anything but chimichangas!\n\nHowever, my mother always has the pollo fundido, which I've also tried; it's AMAZING!\n\nI love their salsa as well.\n\nI've been going for 20 years, I'm not stopping any time soon!",1
"My husband and I ate at Carlos O'Brien's last night; to our dismay, the food was inedible.  It was a disappointing evening since we do not go out to dinner very often since the recession.\n\nI ordered the Carlos Carnitas Dinner.  The pork tasted dried, rubbery, and days old.  Between us, we ate three bites of it and put it aside.  My husband's dinner, Pollo Fundido, was not any better.  The pollo fundido was over salted and made with poor quality ingredients; the chicken appeared to have come from a can versus fresh, and the cheese tasted processed versus real.  We only ate a couple of bites of it and sadly called it a night, going home to eat bowls of cereal for dinner instead.",0
"We just moved in the area and were looking forward in having our Friday Family dinners here. Waited 20 minutes for our waitress. No apology nothing just asked us for our drinks and were we ready to order. Dinner wasn't bad but nothing great... 11.95 for my meal with no rice and beans... $50 later for the three of us kinda made it sting a little more... so I informed the hostess of my concerns, she gave the I will let the manager know answer... So since the food is ok but the service is most likely the norm. I don't think I will be back.. I can do fast food for that kind of service....\nI don't think I can give a star due to the service but yelp forces me to.",0
A family tradition the past 6 years. My favorite is the Carlos Carnitas Dinner. My wife likes the Little Bit of everything Plate. They have Happy Hour as well and the prices are reasonable.,1
"I have been going here for many years now. The food is always good and you always leave full. The tostada is so big I can barley get my mouth over it to take a bite. The shredded beef tacos are great. I also love the flautas and the chicken fajita chimi. The chimi's here are huge! The beans and rice are great to. So many mexican food restaurants have rice that's tasteless, which is funny cause it comes with every plate they serve. You would think they would put some flavor in that rice, but here they do. Always a good meal and I would recommend it for sure.",1
"Has been years that haven't been there and I am still pissed at how poorly we were treated there. Maybe it has changed but I will never step foot there ever again. Food was OK I guess but the service was horrible. If you like your food to be thrown in your face by the waitress and you have to clean up HER mess, you should go there. Oh, and bring your own utensils since they don't seem to be willing to provide them. The manager couldn't have cared less, the staff just seemed to be going thru the motions. Horrible experience.",0
"The chips and salsa were the best part of the meal.  The service was good, but the food lacked flavor and was quite bland.  My steak fajitas and the peppers and onions that came with them were not flavorful at all.  The re fried beans were overcooked and were simply bad.  The queso app was OK, but nothing special.  With all the choices in central Phoenix, I will be going elsewhere for my Mexican fix.",0
"It had been years since I had been to Carlos O'Briens and last night was a reminder why it had been so long. The wait was short..we were seated right away and before we even settled into the booth we had our water with our chips and salsa. The waitress was pleasant and refilled our beverages, the restrooms clean. \n\nSo why do you say, \""""Only 2 stars?\"""" The food..where to begin about the food. Our meal started on such a high note, the chips were hot and the salsa fresh..that is where the high notes end. My pollo fundido was extremely dry with chicken that tasted like it had been boiled with absolutely no seasoning..no salt, no pepper..nothing. The jalapeno cream sauce was good and the dish had plenty of melted cheese, but all of that unseasoned chicken just made it so very unappealing. The beans  had a good flavor but they looked like they had been under a heat lamp for a while, all of that gooey melted cheese couldn't hide the hard, dry crust that had formed on top. And the rice....I will just leave it at that, rice\n\nThe husband had a shredded beef enchilada & taco combo. He ate the enchilada, said it was ok, but the taco..again, boiled, unseasoned meat, which he left on the plate. The child had a grilled cheese sandwich. Really over toasted bread with unmelted cheese, how can you mess up a 4 year olds grilled cheese? \n\nCarlos O'Brien has the potential to be a great mexican restaurant. It's affordable, the restaurant is clean and they are in an area with not a whole lot of dining options (maybe that is why they have been a round for so long) but unless they take a little more pride in the actual food..I don't think in this econony they might not make it.",0
I went there recently and in the past it used to be my go to place. Sadly the food is not what it used to be and I no longer crave their chimichangas anymore. As for the Drinks yes these Margaritas are one of the best might just go for happy hour for now on.,0
"At the Scottsdale location, they used to have a really wonderful manager, an older Mexican gentleman who put his heart into the place.  They got rid of him, put in a relative and things declined.  I'm surprised Corey let this happen.  It used to be a special place.  Then prices went up and quality declined.",0
"This is strictly a \""""produce as much as possible\"""" for the masses.  The food used to be good.  it is now made with cheap ingredients and tastes like oil.  It is pretty bad and the salsa has taken a real dive too.  It used to be fun and enjoyable.  Now it seems like an overpriced fast food place.  Don't go!",0
Some of the best Mexican food I've ever tasted! \nChips and salsa are my fav! \nDinner plate #1 beef taco and cheese enchilada yum yum! \nFast cooking- great service!! \n.....Can't wait to come back Tom and try the salmon w/ mango.,1
An unexpected find. A very homey and comfortable place. Food was fabulous! Had a steak chimichanga.....of which I've never tried before and it was amazing. The crispy outside and packed with goodness inside was just wonderful. The downfall is the portion size is enough to feed two people....so you will need to take the rest home..or share. :),1
"I wasn't sure about going here. It came highly recommended but I read some reviews and they weren't great. I think the problem is that some people have unreasonable expectations, especially after having visited for myself. The food was pretty good, the portions were unusually large and the service was far above average. This is not the best Mexican food I have ever had, but nobody at my table had anything but positive to say about their menu choices. My daughter in particular had an adult-size meal that she ordered from the kids menu. I tried it. It was almost as good as my carnitas chimichanga. I hope that people wait til they are in a better mood before they write their reviews. When a place truly sucks then I could see, but this place doesn't.",1
"Carlos O'Brien's is perhaps the largest restaurant in the world (overkill? Maybe, but it's still a pretty big place) and there is this strange swing hanging from the rafters in one part of the restaurant.  I really wonder what it used to be.  But, now it's Carlos O'Brien's.  If you are dining in, order the queso dip.  It is delicious! But that's really all I would recommend.  Everything else is mediocre and super cheesy.  However, if you are using them to cater, I say order the mini chimis, mini tacos and mini flautas.  Great price to feed a large party at your house.\n\nAlso, with the size, there is never a wait.",0
"This was good for higher end mexican food, I am more of a fan of \""""truck/street food\"""" but A great place for lunch!! big portions, good prices. The other reviews are dead on with the chips and salsa...very yummy!",1
"I've lived in the Valley for 20 years and never ate here until a couple of months ago, despite it being highly recommended by a lot of people.\n\nI think I have to rethink my opinion on the people that recommended it....YUCK!!!!!! The food has no flavor and everything is covered in shredded iceberg lettuce and \""""mexican cheese blend.\""""\n\nPlus the restaurant looks and feels like it hasn't been cleaned or changed since 1984.  I actually didn't want to touch anything.  \n\nShut this place down.  You're done.",0
"Used to go here a lot with the fam when I was younger, not sure why we stopped. Anyway, went this week for lunch. It was just as good as I remembered. Nachos are super cheesy, great amount of shredded beef too. They are a meal all by themselves. They still have my favorite dish- pollo fundido. Chicken chimis, covered in jalapeno cream cheese, and topped with melted cheese. That's one thing about this place, they are not shy with the cheese, which to me, is OK. Waiter staff was great, very attentive with drink refills. I will have to go here more often.",1
My wife and I stopped in for dinner and margaritas. We were seated right away and served chips and salsa  from there we sat and waited and waited for our waitress to show up.  We ordered food and drinks together because we weren't sure how long it would take her to return. Good thing because she didn't come back until food was ready. \nI ordered the pollo fundido. The chicken had NO flavor and the cream cheese on the top was so thick you couldn't taste anything but cream cheese.  We will NEVER return!!!,0
"Been going there, since I was a kid! Still a great place to gather, large parties of 8 or more never seem to be a problem. The Irish Mexican pops out a mean cheese crisp! And they even have wheat tortilla's! Foods fresh, place is clean, service is great, & the tacos ROCK, but for a kick, my fav. is the green chili burros done enchie style!! Race on over.",1
I tried this with a social coupon. The skinny margaritas are not that good. The food was o.k. but not worth the effort when I have better closer to my house.,0
"So we went to Carlos O'Brians for lunch today. I have been coming here for about 30-35 years, so for the most part it's good. If it's not good, they'll fix it! I keep coming because I love their food \""""most of the time\"""", but other times, not so much! It just depends on who's cooking!\nToday, I decided to order the poyo fondito(can't spell it) I took a bite and there was barely any cream cheese and hardly any shredded cheese melted on top and the chicken inside was very dry, so I asked the lady for more cream cheese & melted shredded cheese. She brought me back a bowel of orange marshmellowey looking stuff. At first I was like, eww gross, but then I tasted it and it was actually good. So I lathered up my burito and gained an extra 5 pounds, LMAO, Just kidding!\nSeriously though, it did take care of that dry chicken. So I guess you just gotta know how to fix your food when it doesn't taste right, right?",1
Full plate of not so tasty and unrecognizeable food. \ntacos were soaked in grease.  Phoenix just doesnt know how to do Mexican food....:-),0
"Went there with friends. Had the pollo fundido. It was good. Problem was there was a table of 20 somethings near us. They were very drunk, and the waiter continued to serve them. They were obnoxious, yelling f bombs constantly. My friend's wife eventually became irritated with constant barrage of expletives. At this point, I asked them to kindly cut back on the f-bombs. You would have thought I insulted their mothers by their response. immediately, the 4 guys became belligerent and threatened to kick our asses. One guy even asked the waiter if he could beat me up. He said that he knew the owner and he could do whatever he wanted. At this point, we decided to leave with our meals unfinished. I didn't take my family out to fight with 4 drunks. I spoke to the manager. He did apologize, and admitted that they WERE REGULARS. Apparently, he did speak to them, as they were leaving while we paid our bill at the front register. The manager didn't offer to comp us anything for our troubles. At least it wasn't boring. If you like to fight with drunks, maybe they will be when you go!",0
"Was my 1st time at Carlos O'Brien's, it was a friends 40th birthday dinner and this is her favorite place to go. I went with high expectations because she has told me over and over the past few years how good this place is.\n\nI arrived couple minutes after everyone was there and saw that the party (there was about 25 of us) was broken sort of into you, half the party down one side and other wrapped around the middle and the birthday girl was kind of not at either tables, just in the middle of the 2, which made it difficult for conversations to flow, you could talk to your half of the table, but if you want to talk with those on the other side of the restaurant, get up and walk over their then, needless to say, I stayed where I was at and talked amongst my fellow friends on my side, kept giving the bday girl a shout out and drinks to let her know we are here to party! \n\nLet's start with the salsa, their where 2 types, a pico de gallo and a hotter blend, which reminded me more of a smoky chipotle sauce.  Well the pico looked great, but had absolutely no flavor, no pepper ,no onion, no tomato flavor, not even the cilantro, which is my favorite ingredient to cook with, had flavor, even if you added salt and pepper to it, it didn't help.  The hotter of the two did have a nice smoky chipotle taste to it, so that was the one I went with it.\n \nI went with the filet of Salmon with mango salsa with Spanish rice and black beans.  The fish was perfectly cooked, and even though the top of the fish appeared to have some sort of rub on it, it too was lacking in flavor, I tossed on the mango salsa to see if that would help and sadly it did not, no flavor at all. I topped it with the smoky chipotle to give some sort of flavor and appearance that I'm not eating mush. The rice and beans were perfectly cooked, no issues there.  Had this dish had flavor to it, it would have been amazing, but nope it did not.\n\nNow like I said we were spilt into 2 along one sided booth table things from one end of the room to the other, and there was apx 25 if not more of us. But by the time my end of the table had gotten their food, the other half was already paying and leaving.  It was not because I was late; I got their in time for orders to be taken. This was poor planning on the server's behalf, half the party had ready left by the time we got our bills.  I was bummed because I was wanting to catch up with a friend I hadn't seen in a while and poof she was gone .  I wanted to like this place, but I'm afraid I am a onetime diner here.",0
"This place is amazing! Where do I start? Carlos O'Brien's was my first eat-out experience when I moved here and I have gone back many, many times since. It's a great place to meet and eat - they have a huge restaurant with plenty of seating. The food alone is a reason to go, but the staff is always friendly and the service is very quick. My favorite dish is the CHICKEN FONDIDO! If you like fried chicken, cheese and cream cheese THEN LOOK NO FURTHER because the Chicken Fondido is the end-all be-all of amazingness!\nGranted that the food is not authentic Mexican, it is very interesting to combine Mexican and Irish food. Coming from a Spanish and Irish family, I felt quite at home looking at the menu and having to choose between corned beef and nachos.\nAnd it gets even better when you consider the prices. For the over-the-top portions you receive, the prices are very agreeable. \nThe atmosphere is clean, friendly and inviting. If you're on a date you can ask for a more intimate table and they will be happy to seat you somewhere you can kanoodle with your date.\nDrinks from the bar are prompt and put together correctly. Never once have I had to send something back to be remade - even when I've ordered complicated mixed drinks.\nA couple can go and have dinner, drinks and dessert for under $30.\nI really, really enjoy this place and highly recommend it to everyone: single people, couples, families and friends!",1
"I love this place!! I live down the street so I'm there at least once every couple of weeks, more if I had a bad day at work! The food isn't the best, but the carnitas dinner and con carne dinner is delicious!! The service in the bar area is amazing!! Definitely worth trying for happy hour or anytime actually...They treat you like family and we always end up making new friends. There are a lot of regulars that go so it creates a nice friendly environment. I highly recommend this place!",1
"We use to eat at this place frequently going  back to the 80's. Frequently turned into seldomly and after tonight from seldomly to not at all. The food I ordered is very heavy and not healthy, like the McDonald's of Mexican food.  Loaded with crap it did not even taste good. I think they forgot how to make Mexican food. It's too bad, I liked this place.",0
"Awful! My Mom and I decided to stop in and each have a taco with an iced tea. I ordered lemon with my tea. My tea was served with a lemon as requested but it had a long dark hair wrapped around the lemon. I told the server and he had the nerve to bring me another one, also with a lemon (it should have at least been on the side after that!). After that, our tacos were not so appetizing! The kicker? Our server still charged us for my beverage! We went to pay our bill and had to actually get the manager to take off the tea from our bill. The manager offered no apologies and seemed to smirking about it. All's he said was \""""These guys no better than that\""""! Too bad because my boyfriend loves this place. Accidents happen but it is how it was handled......never again!",0
Portions are huge but not high quality. Atmosphere is very dated. Spicy wings are too spicy.,0
"My family and I stopped by Carlo's O'Briens while on a trip to Arizona. We wanted Mexican so I found them from Google. I was surprised because the yelp reviews were only around 3 stars but overall I felt GREAT service and Great FOOD!! Ecspecially the \""""Queso cheese dip\"""" YUM! They have a nice patio with plasma T.V. . Overall great relaxed atmosphere. For the price this restaurant is Delish!",1
"Terrible. Long wait, food was a mess and unappealing. One of the worst places I've been.",0
My husband took me to dinner here once. For such a big venue it was extremely empty. \nOnce the food arrived I knew why. The food was so bland. I could have made dinner that night for way cheaper.,0
Went to the Avondale location and we had pollo fundido and the spinich enchilada.  Food and drinks were really good and service was great!,1
"Not sure what's happened to this place but it has gone down hill. We use to drive across town to eat here. We went here for a business lunch and it wasn't that good, service was bad and the food was slopped onto the plates. Sad to see one of my old favs turn into just another crappy Mexican food place.",0
The fajitas were fantastic. We ordered the steak and shrimp and they were HUGE. Great portions. Fair price. I'll be back.,1
here for happy hour on the patio 1st strike was the lipstick on my draft beer glass. 2nd was the the very rude server who treated our group like we came to dine and dash... the good points the chicken fundio and them accommodating my friends lap dog on their patio. good food bad service. yo Pancho stop being an ass no tip for you buddy.,0
I've been coming to this place for over 15 years is a wonderful Mexican restaurant the food is very good and the price is incredible and their plates are enormous.,1
"Here I was, so convinced I was going to be the first to Yelp about this place. It was going to be like the time I started listening to the Postal Service before anyone else I knew and then they got huge I was like \""""Yeah I used to like them but I got kinda burned out since I've been listening to them for so long. No big deal.\"""" \n\nPoint is, it's only a matter of time before more people discover this place, its totally unimpressive strip-mallified facade, but go in anyway because of a recommendation, and are BLOWN AWAY by the tasty red sauce. For selfish reasons, I hope it takes a while for that to happen so I don't have to wait to get a table. \n\nAnd the BYOB thing is no myth. Apparently they're waiting on a liquor license (which can take a while) and until then, you can bring your own booze by the truckload and there's no corkage fee. \n\nIt's a small, family-owned joint inside a strip of mostly manicure shops. Don't be put off, go and get something, anything, so long as it has red sauce, and you won't be disappointed. Scout's honor.",1
"Love it, love it, love it! You can bring your own booze too! A little bit of a wait but not bad.",1
Ick!\n\nNothing like a 20 pound pizza full of oil & cheese.\n\nYou know its going to be bad when you pick it up & the box feels like its going to dissolve in your hands.,0
"HORRIBLE!!  I had to wait for my Spaghetti and Meatball stuffed Calzone!  They should have known I was coming!!!  \n\nThe food was just as good as I remember from 2 years ago...maybe even better!  We had dinner there Saturday night and it's now Sunday and I'm drooling thinking about my leftovers in the fridge...That yummy, yummy, yummy sauce....mmmmmmmmmm.\n\nOK, *burp* (excuse me) I'm back... mmmm that was good! \n\n:(  Now I have no more left :(\n\nUnfortunately, they don't have one in Chandler...I wonder if I can get Mr. Spinato to open up a 5th one out here! *hint* *hint*",1
I was craving great pizza and this place was recommended by a friend so I went to check it out. The service was awful and was given by high schoolers who obviously had more important things to be doing. I think they must of screwed up the batch of sauce because it was so sweet I couldn't even have bite number 2. I don't like sweet marinara or pizza sauce. The party I was with was a bit less picky but needless to say we didn't box the left overs which were plentiful.,0
"Let me share my Spinato's experience with you.\n\nI have had their pizza a few times, but the last time was the last. And I mean it. The last experience was with their food I ordered \""""Traditional Vegetarian\"""", with added pepperoncini. Got home, no pepperoncini. Oh well, no big deal. Started eating it and discovered a strange flavor. Kinda like dog treats. Went to kitchen to inspect pizza. Well, low and behold, under the inch or so of cheez (I don't think its real cheese) was PEPPERONI on the \""""Traditional Vegetarian\"""". UHM OK?! Verified the receipt and it was entered correctly! This household doesn't eat animals. I'm sorry, between the overly sweetened sauce, too much cheese, undercooked crust and the mixup I will never again waste my money here.\n\nPlease, if you want pizza, do not come here.",0
"A little background.... \n\nMy husband is from a sleepy community about an hour south of Chicago. My husband could/would eat pizza everyday of his life if I permitted. When we went back to visit his parents he actually took me on a pizza tour of the area all of which ended with his absolute favorite pizza, Aurelio's. His love for this pizza stems from childhood and I honestly do not think you could convince him that there is a greater pizza out there. I even once looked into shipping Aurelio's for a birthday present and quickly realized that that was insanely expensive. \n\nFast forward to this summer when I discovered a review on Yelp that mentioned that there used to be an Aurelio's here in AZ that eventually became Spinato's. Well my husband insisted that we get in the car that moment and check it out. The sweet marinara is exactly what he was looking for and while not exactly the same this is the closest pizza in Arizona to his beloved favorite. The crust is thin and the sausage is hand crumbled (or appears to be). They are very generous on the cheese and toppings in general and leftovers the next day aren't too shabby. We have never had an issue with service or our order on the several occasions we have been One of my favorite things about Spinato's is the ice, seriously I have a passion for crushed ice and lots of it!",1
"So good!!!  They ran out of thick crust, but I was more than satisfied with the spinach special and chicago special (sausage, onions and bell peppers).  As other reviewers noted, the sauce is pretty sweet, but I do like sweets.  The spinach pizza was covered with delicious roasted garlic, and both came out piping hot.  \n\nThe spaghetti calzone appetizer was interesting and very good.  Because the pizzas were thin crust and covered with toppings, I needed some bread or pasta to balance it all out.  The pasta filled calzone was a good foil.\n\nThe gelato was a little sandy, but the cannoli was pretty good.  I came here for pizza, not dessert, so I don't mind.\n\nOh, the restaurant is located in a quiet little plaza, and the wait time was 25 minutes on a Saturday night.  There was a good-sized wine and beer menu, and the inside feels like an old Italian kitchen.  Service was wonderful.",1
"This is the best pizza, by far, in my neighborhood. The pizza was awesome!!!!!! I will be going back Tomorrow for round 2.",1
"Lately I find my tastes changing. These changes ambush me without warning: not long ago I stopped putting Splenda in my tea - cold turkey. I started liking pastrami instead of corned beef. I stopped watching the news on TV. Is this a function of aging? I don't know.\n\nOne of the more dramatic changes has been my growing appreciation of the overall \""""character\"""" of a restaurant. I find myself much more willing to overlook small gaffes in the food preparation if the staff is friendly and knowledgeable, or if the ambience is cheerful and interesting in some way. It doesn't have to be fancy - but it can't be gloomy and boring.\n\nThis was brought home to me today at lunch. Our friend Sue picked a place I had never been to - Spinato's Pizza. It's a family owned and run local chain with four locations. We went to the one at Bell and 16th Street. Sue brought along her friend/employer Lee. It happens that Lee's grandson works in Spinato's kitchen. He always makes it a point to arrive 35 minutes before his shift begins so he can take advantage of employee dinner and he appreciates being treated like family. The place is cute - decorated in red, green and white. There are striped awnings above the booths, and trellises with vines. The chairs are white with green (or red) seats, and the table tops are white with the Spinato logo in the corners. The patio has tables with red-checked cloths. We were warmly greeted , and our server arrived promptly to offer drinks.\n\nKen and I ordered a large Spicy Italian pie ($19.50) with added ricotta. We also got a salad ($3.99). Lee requested garlic bread ($3.99, $4.79 with cheese), and a small spinach calzone, one of the house specialties ($9). Sue got spinach too, but in the form of a \""""lil\"""" (smaller than small) pizza ($7.50). The salads arrived first, notable mostly for their large size. While the ingredients were fresh, there was nothing exciting there. The olive oil and balsamic vinegar served with them were of good quality. The garlic bread, eight pieces in the order, was outstanding - lots and lots of fresh garlic and a generous amount of butter. You have to make sure that everyone you'll be talking to in the next few hours has eaten some too. The staff checked in frequently to ask if we were happy. The pizzas were served on a wire rack, a great idea since the thin crust remains nice and crisp. Instead of slices, our pie was cut into many small squares. I found that for some reason this caused me to eat less. The pizza wasn't loaded down with sauce, and it had plenty of toppings. I tasted Sue's spinach pie and it was really good. The spinach is marinated before being put on the pizza, and there's tons of fresh garlic. Lee's calzone was quite large - he took half of it home.\n\nThe menu isn't extensive. Besides the pizzas (10 varieties, plus design your own)  and calzone (there's a spaghetti and meatball one) there are two pastas and five sandwiches. We didn't inquire about dessert. The story behind Spinato's is told on the back of the menu. The family was worried that when they left Chicago for Phoenix, back in the \""""70's, they wouldn't be able to find good pizza. What choice did they have but to open their own pizza parlor?! As the family grew so did the number of parlors. While the prices aren't low, you can go to lunchclub.com and get a 25% off the entire bill coupon. Aren't coupons great!!\n\nI have to say that if I was doing a blind taste-test between Stumpy's pizza (see the archives) and Spinato's, I'd probably give the nod to Stumpy's. But if you add in those other factors which have become important to me, as a dining destination Spinato's wins. It's also won awards from Phoenix New Times, the Scottsdale Culinary Festival and City Search.",1
"Hands down the best delivery I have had in years. Feeling to lazy to cook I ordered Spinato's last night. I got the super six pizza, thin crust, well done with extra sauce, a small dinner salad and a side order of meatballs. \n\nThe pizza was Chicago style and phenomenal! (See pictures) The pizza ingredients were really fresh and the sauce (OH THE SAUCE) tangy and sweet. The meatballs were also delicious and had a very different marinara sauce than what was on the pizza. Spinato's beats any delivery in my area (Sorry Pat's) and has made the rotation in to my favorite Chicago style pizza. I can't wait to actually try the restaurant, I heard they have great specials and BYOB.",1
my personal fave is the spaghetti & meatball calzone - YUM!\n\nthe restaurant is casual and b.y.o.b. which makes it good for families and/or groups. delivery is limited to a small area and can take awhile. \n\nsecret hint: they put sugar in the sauce.. no wonder it's so darn good!!!,1
"Ben here a few times for lunch. Its in a tiny strip mall, and parking can be an issue. We have always had the thin crust pizza and it has always been very good. A large usually will feed two of us.. gluttony definately takes over while your here, and you have to remember to control yourself :)",1
"Oh, Spinato's!  Somehow your unbelievably delicious Mama's Original pizza made a spinach-lover out of my 4-year-old.  Amazing!  We also love the Spicy Italian (who doesn't like spicy Italians?!).  The antipasto salad with half spinach is always crisp, fresh and delicious.  Extra points for the gluten-free crust option!  Spinato's is the perfect place to bring a family or grab a pizza to go.",1
"I have never been disappointed at any of the spinato's locations! \nI first went to the one in Tempe. It's a weird location, in a business park. It's byob, wich was great! I tried the spinach pizza and I could not believe how perfect it was. \nAll the things I love at spinato's:\nThe spinach pizza, sometimes I add sausage or meatballs.\nThe L'Italiana.\nThe get meaty.\nThe mushroom sausage.\nThe Bruschetta.\nIf you want jalapenos on your pizza but others don't the will even heat them in the oven for you to put on at the table,instead of just slinging some cold ones at you.\nThe service is always super friendly without being annoying.\nThe only other pizza I like as well  in town is at pizzaria bianco.\nGive these people your money, they deserve it!!",1
"There is something strangely addicting about Spinatos. I don't like to think of this as traditional pizza, as the sauce is much sweeter and the combinations unexpected. BUT it's still delicious and I find myself craving it ALL THE TIME. \n\nTwo thumbs up for \""""The Signature\"""" and \""""The Other Signature\"""" pizzas, as well as the calzones (with ricotta!) and desserts. The garlic bread is yummy, too. We always order the same things (see, above), but I am looking forward to branching out trying some other dishes (see: Antipasto, Sandwiches).\n\nTo all of the sauce haters: accept it for what it is and get over it. The sauce works with their pizzas, and if you don't like it, don't eat it! But don't hate.",1
"I was so excited to try it because people rave. NOT a fan. I guess if you like super sweet sauce it will be up your alley. I couldn't eat it. I will stick to Joe's pizza or Slice of Sicily, pay much less and enjoy much more.",0
"Spinato's originated from Chicago. If I lived in Chicago I would be happy about them moving to AZ. My wife and I shared a thin crust sausage, onion and greenpepper pizza and did not enjoy it. The pizza was bland, maybe it was missing the fennel seeds in the italian suasage that seems to give the sausage that wonderful flavor. I couldn't quite pinpoint what was missing but I'm guessing I won't be making another visit to Spinato's.",0
"I've got bad news for you. One day, you're gonna' die. \nI've also got good news for you. You're gonna wake up and be standing at the pearly gates. \nThe bad news is that they're gonna' be closed. \nThe good news is that they more than likely are going to swing wide for you and a choir of heavenly angels will sing as you walk through. \nThe bad news is that your Aunt Agnes, who used to like to pinch the crap out of your cheek until she kicked the bucket will be there to greet you. \nThe good news is that she's going to hand you a box that says \""""Spinato's\"""" on it. \nYou open the box. \nIf it's empty, you're in hell.\nBut more than likely, it's got a piping hot, fresh-made a Mamma Spinato's Signature Fresh Spinash pie. Your piehole will be dripping, and as you lift a piece to your lips, even Aunt Agnes's pinching of your cheek will seem like a blessing. Yeah, it's that good. If they serve pizza in heaven, it's Mamma Spinato's. The good news is you don't have to croak to enjoy it. And they deliver. And it's hot! Manga!\nQuick notes: Their \""""medium\"""" is everyone else's large. I did not see their large, but I bet it's manly indeed. Extra star for square cutting the pie. Spinato's is what pizza is ALL about.",1
Family owned and super fresh ingredients. Their pizza sauce is the best I've ever had. Their salads are great too. Even the delivery guys are the best. Love this place!,1
"Only every had the pizza, when in the area we stop here. Just wish it was closer to me.  The sauce is unique and wonderful.",1
"Spinatos is so darn good I have been going for years, now I have one in ahwatukee.  I am thrilled, the pizza has the best sauce and the best tasting sausage I ever had.  The staff has been great over the years, and mostly it's the same people.  I literally crave the sauce",1
"Oh my god, oh my god. Where have you been for my entire pizza eating life?  Spinatos is great!  I love the spicy Italian pizza and the ... Mamas spinach is what I think the pizza is called. I have not dined in, but I will be making up for that soon... I promise. The quality of the food and the friendly family feeling service is great. Although not an artisan pizza place like the Parlor or Bianco, this is my go to place for pizza.  Who needs Pizza Hut or any other delivery chain when you have a great pizza place right around the corner.",1
I tried this place because of all the wonderful reviews.  I have to say I was extremely disappointed. I ordered the mama signature pizza and a dinner salad. The salad is something I would expect from a lousy fast food place.  The pizza was flavorless and the crust was just a soggy mush.  I will not be eating her again.,0
Hnnngffff their signature spinach pizza\nIt's the only thing I've ever ordered there\nAnd it alone warrants 5 stars.,1
Our family always enjoys a night a spinatos. We always request Lorenzo as our server.,1
"Some of the best pizza I have ever eaten.  The ingredients are fresh and the flavors are explosive! When I order for take-out, even after only 10 minutes of a drive in my car, my car ends up smelling like the pizza for 2 full weeks! The antipasto wasn't much to write home about as the house Italian dressing wasn't very flavorful, but the 2 spinach pizzas are AMAZING.  I also just tried the Chicago last night and it was so so good.  Check this place out for eat in or for take-out.  Just expect your car to smell like this stuff for 2 weeks.",1
"We ate here twice in one week on our spring break vacation. First, we at there and had the special spinach pizza. We don't eat meat, so the idea that there was a special pizza that didn't have meat was fascinating and boy did it deliver on taste. Super garlicky, if you're into that kind of thing. Kiddo's plain cheese pizza was even good. Then we ordered a to-go super veggie pizza for round two. That was delicious as well. Good service, not fancy. Just go and eat and drink and have a nice time.",1
"From the husband (native Chicagoan):  \""""I've not had pizza this good west of St. Louis.\"""" That said, he had some notes, but who cares? If you are in Phoenix and looking for good Chicago pizza, try Spinato's. I had the \""""half and half, double meat and cheese antipasto salad,\"""" which was excellent. We also ordered a spinach and sausage thin crust pizza--also excellent. Also, they delivered to the Hilton Squaw Peak hotel on 16th St.",1
"Had Spinato's for take out last night. Good service... Ordered the sausage thin crust. The bottom of the crust wasn't very good, could have been cooked longer. Sauce was a little sweeter and didn't have any special flavor. Pizza seemed like it had too much cheese. Not the pizza for me.",0
"Since moving more centralized, this has become my wife and I's favorite pizza for dine in and to go, as well as the Bell location.  They offer gluten free crust, willing to do no cheese and several sizes of pizza, so your party can get one or two pizza's for all or everyone can get their own preference.  I generally get the small size for myself, which leaves my with 30-40% of the pie for leftovers for breakfast or lunch.  Not bad to get 2 meals for $8-12. The Lil' size is usually enough for 1, if you will not be near a fridge in the near future.  My faves are the Spicy Italian and Canadian.  The services is always, friendly and the staff makes you feel at home!",1
"Best Pizza ever!! ingredients are fresh. you get quality pizza! For a good price!\""""",1
"This is the best pizza in Phoenix.  I have only been to this location once, but I have been to the Bell/16th St. location numerous times.  Their canolies are amazing too.  They get extremely busy on weekend nights, so plan ahead.  I think they are closed on Sundays or Mondays too.",1
"Neighborhood pizzaria right across from my other favorite, Pat's Pizza.  Pat's excels at the New York thin crust while Spinato's has a great deep dish Chicago version that is excellent and not at all greasy.  The sauces (both the pizza and the pasta) are great and you can get extra on the side.  In the rare event you are still hungry I'd say get frozen yogurt across the street and skip the desserts which are a bit weak.  But how can you not love a family restaurant that feels like every pizza place in America?",1
"After about 5 failed attempts at finding a pizza joint worth the money we were invited to Spinato's.  The only thing negative I have to say is that our service was not great.  The watier seemed way \""""too cool\"""" for his job.  My daughter never got her meatballs.  When she finally did, 20 minutes after the pizza, they were free.  But still, she was hungry.  The service didn't take away from the fact that the pizza was SOOOO cheesey and delicisous.  I love the cross cutting style.  I can't decribe it any other way than utter cheesy goodness.  If you love your pizza cheesy and gooey and messy..this is the place for you.  If you are in the mood for whole wheat, less cheese and health pizza...find somewhere else!",1
"Only one word comes to mind about this place \""""OVERRATED\"""" i ordered the sausage with extra sauce, the extra sauce was spread around the top of the pizza...COLD which made the pizza disgusting already the sausage was nothing to write home about. good service i suppose and that's the only reason i'm not giving it 1 star, as far as Chicago Style goes i think Johnnie's pizza is light years ahead. Not worth it if your in that shopping center and you must eat just go to Codfathers.",0
Unbelievably delicious pizza - the marinated spinach on a couple of them - L'Italiana and Mama's - is fantastic. We tried the calzones - I think they were the best I've ever had. We tried the Baked Spaghetti and Mama's spinach calzones. I don't know why we would go anywhere else for pizza or calzones unless we're out of town! \nWe have only gotten take-out so far but look forward to eating in next time we go out.,1
"This is a terrible place to try to take a large group.  The food is mediocre at best.  But they run the place poorly.\n\nWe called ahead to see if they could seat a party of 8.  They told us that they could not take our name over the phone, instead we had to show up to put our names in.  My wife went ahead and reserved the table.  She was told it would be 45 minutes.  She came home and we began getting the kids ready.  We showed up 15 minutes before we were told, but they had already given the table away.  We were told that it would be another half hour before we could be seated.  \n\nUnfortunately, their waiting area is very packed and does not hold 8 comfortably.   We left, I will never go back.  It should not be a hassle to take your family out to eat.  The main reason for eating out is to avoid hassle.  Spinato's does a good job of making life difficult.",0
"I ordered online for take out. I got the margherita pizza and a spinach calzone. The pizza had no sauce on it. None. Not like any margherita I've ever had. The calzone had way too much garlic and it was really sweet. Also, everything was incredibly oily. Yuck. It was almost inedible. \n\nAlso, there's a problem with their online ordering system. I ordered the pizza under my name. I had to set up an account with a password and everything. No big deal. When I placed my order the only option to pay was immediately instead of also at the pizza shop. My husband gave me his credit card to pay with and I did so. Still this is all fine other than the pizza shop losing out on a tipping opportunity but, whatever, not my business. When we got to Spinato's my order was nowhere to be found. They asked me if it could be under a different name and I said no I just set up my account and we already paid, what's going on with our order? Then as we're trying to figure out what happened we started going over what we ordered and then a man appeared with the food. My name was right on it. I pointed out that there's my name printed right on the piece of paper that's with the food. Then the lady behind the counter got a little condescending with her tone as she told me that the order is under the name on the credit card. I kept my name so me and my husband have different names. Why didn't she say this in the first place? Why the condescending tone? She might work there and know how the system is set up but, as a first time customer how would I? \n\nAlso, if the food is under credit card name and they require that you pay online immediately when you order then why do I need an account unless they want to spam me for ordering food from them? or sell my info for extra $$",0
Hells yeah!,1
"Love it. 6 stars - at least. Great service from everyone. Server, manager, hostess. Great pizza. I'm a bit of pizza snob and I really like this pizza. And I think it's a great value. 2 adults, 2 kids - when the check came I truly felt it was a great deal. We've been twice and it's instantly become a favorite. Signature Spinach extra crispy - love the garlic - so good.",1
"Eh. Placed an order for delivery online for the first time tonight.  The confirmation said it would be 75 minutes, which wasn't unreasonable because the NBA Finals were on TV. It actually took 90 minutes and the pizza was barely warm, and definitely not hot. I had to put it in the oven. Ordered the Combo pizza. The Italian sausage was good, the peppers were ok, but the mushrooms were canned. Gross. The sauce was also way too sweet. Definitely not my favorite pizza and I won't be ordering from there again, especially when a large pizza is $20. If you charge that much for a pizza it better show up hot and it better be good.",0
"Food 4 stars - service 5+ stars\n\nFound this on Yelp on got there right when it opened.  Within 15 minutes the place was packed, we thought....\""""this must be good\"""".  We tried the beef steak calzone with au jus - very tasty.  I tried the Natalie's new pizza (small size) and my BF had a meat pizza.  I wasn't a huge fan of the thin crust - it is more cornmeal than dough but the toppings and flavor profile was delicious.  we also had salad since and tried 2 of their 6 homemade dressings.\n\nThe waitress was fantastic.  She even brought a sample of their vodka marinara and marinara sauces to try and they were incredible.  They were dark red, very condensed, excellent flavor.  They sell the dressings & sauces at the store.  \n\nA good find and we would definitely go back.",1
"My favorite pizza in town! I love the thin crust. Sweet sauce, thin crunchy crust, gooey cheese. Great combination of flavors. Man, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. I tried the spaghetti calzone: so many carbs, so delicious. And for good measure, they make some really good chocolate chip cookies.",1
Spinato's is wonderful!!! Their signature spinach pizza is to die for!! Every time we have a chance to order pizza for our work we always chose Spinato's. They are super friendly and we have never been disappointed. Definitely worth trying out if your in the mood for pizza!,1
"This is really a 10 star review. My mom came to visit from Oregon and would probably have eaten Spinato's every night if she had the chance. Why you ask? Strangely addictive pizza. In my continuing effort to avoid moving to a wardrobe consisting entirely of pants with elastic waistbands, I usually exercise some level of self discipline when it comes to pizza. If I ate exclusively Spinato's pizza it would  be sweatpants from here on out. \n\nTry the mama's special (I think that is the name) with the marinated spinach. I know it doesn't sound great but it is amazing (throws another pair of sweatpants into the cart at Costco).",1
Sweet sauce....NICE!,1
"I really had to take time and taste this pizza and some how the thin crust with sausage, pepperoni, and mushroom was very salty either due to the sausage or pepperoni but either way its not the quality of items that I am use to in a pizza, a little history about myself I was raised in a family of catering I really get into the taste of food, the tomato sauce I really did not get that feeling on my taste buds of oh that's good, and by the way when a pizza place starts using a dough press instead of kneading the dough themselves looses 2 stars off the the top, you cannot replace kneading and a rolling pin . I have made pizza's before and i make my own sauce and use quality ingredients once you do it yourself for a while then you can really sharpen your taste buds for  quality pizza. I have to say CIBO has a better pizza, and Grimaldi's due to the fact that the dough, tomato sauce is much better quality.\n\n\""""The Gastro\""""",0
"Eating here for years and always enjoy the food. Customer service is a major reason I come back to most places. Tonite I called for delivery because I've been sick for a week. The manager took my order and was incredibly nice with get well wishes. Upon delivery, so was the driver. To my surprise-I received my yumalicious food AND a get well surprise of cookies!! How thoughtful is that?!?! A true Italian family restaurant, filled with heart. Thank you Daniel and Stafff, for the meal & thoughtfulness. It will never be forgotten.",1
"this was the first time in this place, we wanted pizza and stopped here.\nthe pizza:\nthe crust had to be frozen,barely cooked and so disgustingly saggy in oil.\nthe sauce was the most horrifying experience in my life, so gross,sweeten with sugar, it must be because they are definitely using can pizza sauce .\nthe cheese was not cheese, it tasted like rubber,i picked up the stupidly cut small square and the whatever was came off all together..rubber!\nwe order half spinach and half pepperoni, it was so damn oily, the spinach was very salty and the pepperoni (very little) probably the cheapest brand you can get.\ni was very surprise how busy they were, i just can not  understand why a person that like good food (like me) would come back in here.\nthis was the most disgusting PIZZA THAT I EVER TRIED IN MY LIFE..frozen pizza from walmart is 100% times better.\nand the damn thing (i can't call it pizza anymore) was $22 for a 16\"""".\nwaist of money,time and my stomach hurt like hell.\nTERRIBLE!\nDo not go!",0
"my family and I have been going to spinato's for several years, so we where very exited when we found out their new location was only 4 blocks away from our home \""""WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT'' the menu is lacking some of their best dishes we ordered a pizza I don't know if they got new cooks or he was having a bad day I ordered the spaghetti with the side of meatballs and you only get 2 choices of sauce COME ON \""""spaghetti factory you can order the spaghetti with meatballs\"""" I guess if you have to buy separate they charge you more money witch is ridiculous for frozen meatballs I took a bite and it was cold and wet inside  I asked for the manager and he never came, I wonder how many of this reviews are from their friends and family this new restaurant does not measure up to the old one my family and I will not be going back",0
"This is the Pizza I grew up with on the West Side of Chicago, in a Northern Italian neighborhood. Nothing like this is available anywhere else in Phoenix and is worth the drive every single time.",1
"um, this place is great! \n\ndefinitely for the person that does not want to compromise the aesthetics of a nice set of frames!!!\n\n family operated local business, I found them on Yelp and then went in to see what they were about.\n\nI am REALLLY picky when it comes to eyewear, I have very particular taste, and definitely know what I want in a pair of glasses. I found the style of glasses I had been searching everywhere for within 2 minutes of being in the store, and trust me-no small feat! They are funky, geeky, clear acetate heaven...so pomo...aanyways, just go here! It is great!",1
"I had to purchase one item, and found out the closed a few minutes earlier than advertised. Not cool.",0
The store is supposed to open at 9am and the lady in the store seemed crabby and put out that she had to unlock the door at 9:05. She walked over flipped the lock and walked away in a huff. I was there for 15 minutes and she didn't even say hello!,0
"I've been coming here for a long time. The atmostphere is cool. The magazine selection is fantastic. The place has gone downhill a little bit. The stylists used be peppy efficient friendly decent people. Now they all seem to be extremely slow, I mean a haircut every 30 min max. How the hell do you make money doing two $21 haircuts per hour?! The quality of empoyees has also begun to dwindle, kind shabby looking if you know what I mean (the supercuts variety). I don't really know where else to get my hair cut, I really like that they shave your neck with the razor. I tried to contact the owner who I've met and is really fast by the way), but there isn't a website.",0
"unlike the shill reviewer for his store across the street,  I've been going here for years.  Great neighborhood location, friendly American barbers, good value for the money.  This IS NOTt a cheap $9 soviet we-buy-gold place for walmart shoppers.  What you get is a good hair cut, by a nice person, in a clean place.  Unlike every other place I've been to in 40+ years, they wash your hair AFTER the cut to get rid of cut bits and looks like you would normally look hitting the road..  Add in a hot towel, head and neck massage, and it makes a stressful day a lot better.",1
"Lickety-split, it seems I'm always in and out of this place in a jiffy. Why review a UPS Store??  Aren't they all alike??  Absolutely not.  The 16th St and Glendale Store keeps addresses stored on their computer so I just give them my phone number, tell them to whom I am shipping, and (assuming it's a repeat destination), and out comes the shipping form - no messy forms. I think most UPS stores have this capability, but many don't bother. Also, they are diligent about sending a status email so I can track the package. \n\nAside from the holidays, it's usually one of the same two guys in there and they are efficient, understand what to do with international addresses, and are kind and courteous. The few times there is a line, they always apologize for the wait and obviously try to be as speedy as possible. Overall, they act and operate like they WANT my business and appreciate it. That's why I keep coming back, forsaking all others (UPS Stores that is).",1
"I've been going to this store a lot beginning of the year. Staff was always extremely helpful and nice. Owner is there almost always, ready to address and help with anything possible. After few months I went there again, just to send fax and to my surprise they almost doubled the price?! I'm sorry, I just can't go over the fact that they charge $2.21 to fax one page locally (for comparison, it is not more than $1.50 anywhere else). I just don't like that nitpicking and trying to make money on stupid petty stuff. I was making extra effort and going off my way to come and do my business here, and I'm sorry but that won't happen again.",0
"Everyone here goes above and beyond!  Convenient, courteous and efficient.  If you're in the neighborhood , stop by to say hello to Dong, Vic and Stacey.",1
"I'm a graduate student and found myself without a printer. I know, that's terrible isn't it? I needed to read a 27 page article from online, and I can't stand screen reading. So I looked to find a place to have it printed. I was stunned when UPS said it would only cost me $2.43 or so  AND they would have it ready the next day for no additional charge. Staples always charges $5 extra if you want it the next day. So I uploaded the document, paid, and then went to bed. I called the next morning and the woman who answered the phone told me they didn't see it, but located the order a few seconds later. Maybe 5 minutes after we hung up, she called me and left a voicemail that it was ready to pick up. It was perfect because I ride the bus and had to go to Glendale to catch my connecting bus to go to work, so I was able to pick it up between buses. They got me in and out of there in just a couple minutes, and were so sweet. Nothing was wrong with my order and it was perfect. UPS is my new source for printing!",1
"This is the single worst restaurant I've ever been to, anywhere. From the looks of the other reviews, I must have caught them on a bad night, but I swear to God, the tacos I had there tasted like spoiled meat. My friend and I couldn't stomach more than one bite each and were not satisfied by the restaurants lack of concern over our complaints. \n\nWe were made to pay for inedible food and no attempt was made to make things right... And for the record, I've got no problems with 'real' Mexican food-- street vendors and the worst Mexican joints I've been to from LA to Ensenada to Cozumel, are all better than this place.",0
"Not good. The patio is top notch for relaxing if the weather's good but I couldn't shake that chain feeling when inside. Table and chairs had a slightly sticky feeling to them (nice, eh?). Food was typical pre-cooked, oven heated dollop of too much grease and cheese. Not impressed. It's a shame cause the garden and even the nachos & salsa had me expecting big things.",0
"Not really impressed. Food was below average, in my opinion. Chips were just extra greasy, salsa watered down, meals without much taste. Yes, the patio is pretty cool and I imagine that on a busy night this is the place to be, but really, not impressed.\n\nCould be because I had a 13 hour workday, still had food poisoning, and just wanted to be home instead of off for business, but this didn't really make my mood change for the better. Guess that if I was boozing it up it'd be more fun, but then again, what place isn't more fun while boozing it up?",0
"I've been here 3 times on the company tab because it's a fun atmosphere for out-of-town guests. The drinks are good, but the food is meh. Out of the 3 visits, the only thing I remember liking is the soup. Oh, and the flour chips are unique and pretty good. I guess I'll go back for a free meal, but wouldn't consider seeking it out on my own.",0
"My husband and I just moved here from Chicago and we've have Mexican food every Saturday for the last 2 years.  Needless to say, we've been on the hunt for the best Mexican restaurant here in the Phoenix area since we moved here 2 months ago.  Our criteria is simple:  (1) Margaritas, (2) chips and salsa, and (3) food and fajitas.\n\n(1) Margaritas --  Thumbs up!  So far Aunt Chiladas has the best Margaritas I've had in the valley and we've been to quite a few places including Tee Pee (where the food is good but the Margaritas suck).  We ordered the hand shaken margarita and its a pretty big serving with lots of the good stuff in it...\n\n(2)  Chips and Salsa -   Thumbs up!  The chips are unusual in that they are flour not corn and come out nice and hot.  We liked the salsas and I love black olives so the fact it was in the salsa was a big yum factor for me.\n\n(3)  Food/Fajitas - Thumbs up!  We ordered a few different things including the Chingalingas (yum!), steak fajitas, and enchiladas.  We also really liked that they give noodles (fideos) with refried beans instead of rice.  Those are awesome.  The steak fajitas were the bomb\n\nThe only downside is the service is just way too slow.  I mean, we waited and waited and waited.  They were nice enough but bring a pillow because it'll be a while!!",1
"Ate here on a Saturday night. There weren't many people, and we sat outside in spite of the fact that it was chilly. The busser brought two heat lamps over for us, though, which was much more comfortable, until he spilled ice water all over my wife's purse and my foot. He was very apologetic, though, and the server seemed afraid we were going to become irate.\n\nAt any rate, we ordered our food, and it was quite good. My wife & I were pleased with the vegetarian options, though the red sauce on my burrito left something to be desired, as it was quite watery. And the fried Asian noodles they serve on the side of nearly everything are a disgusting waste of food. Beyond those two issues, I enjoyed my meal very much. I tried some of my family's dishes, and they tasted good as well.\n\nAnd the non-corn tortilla chips are rather like elephant ears, or pie crust in my brother-in-law's opinion, but were a unique touch. I was disappointed to find olives in the salsa, but overall we had a good time, good meal and would return on our next trip to AZ.",1
"While my food was great,  I definately didnt enjoy the service.  We waited and waited and waited 45 mins for our food & drinks.  I felt like our waitress forgot we were there.  However she was super attentive when it was time for us to pay...",0
"I probably wouldn't come here nearly as much if I didn't live right down the street. In all honesty, the food is pretty mediocre. \nHowever, I've found a solution that works pretty well for me: get really drunk, then eat. Four stars for Prickly Pear margaritas and being able to stumble home. \nThe flour tortilla chips are pretty damn good and addicting. However I've noticed a suspicious discrepancy in torilla chip ratio lately, they seem to be hiding more flimsy corn chips in with the flour. Very sneaky and lame. \nAnd Fideo? Yuck. Uh no pasta with my mexican food please, I'll stick with the rice. \nIf anything, get drunk and enjoy the wonderful patio on a nice day. I still haven't tried their brunch yet but they had me at Chocolate Fountain.",1
"What a cute place!!\nThat is about the only positive thing about Aunt Chilada's, unfortunately.  The food is not even mediocre IT SUCKS!!  Started with the nearly inedible chips and the dressed-up-ketchup salsa all the way through dessert was downright misery!  And the service sucks too :(",0
"I have to give Aunt Chilada's credit - we stayed for a quite a while at an outside table drinking our margaritas until we realized that at 10:30pm we were the very last people there and that the restaurant had pretty much closed down around us. They had already picked up the check and never pushed us out so we had a relaxing evening.\n\nUnfortunately I was unimpressed with the food. The chips were light and crispy but the salsa tasted pretty generic. A spinach enchilada was very bland and a chile releno was mostly breading with a small chile and cheese but not much flavor. The two people who were with me agreed that their food was mediocre as well. We went with the frozen margarita only because we wanted a pitcher and the margarita on the rocks pitcher was much more expensive. The margarita was also unimpressive - perhaps the more expensive one would have been better but the regular on one the menu just tasted like frozen sour mix. \n\nWe had a good time, but if I were to ever go here again I would probably just go for chips, drinks and appetizers which I could get somewhere else anyway.",0
"On a Sunday night in July, we met up with some out of town friends who were staying at a local hotel.  The location was perfect for them - so, I called and made a reservation for our group.\n\nWhen we first arrived, the bar area was vacant - with the exception of one other table of 2 customers.  Since we had called ahead and let them know that our group would be there at 7, I was hoping for, at least, good service.\n\nUnfortunately, the service was really slow. More than once, someone from our group had to go find our server and request service.  Ugh!  While the conversation from our friends really kept us entertained, it's kind of sad when the server can't seem to remember why she came to work (make money?)\n\nWhile I didin't personally try one, the consensus was the margaritas were more like tequila shooters with fozen ice thrown in - which is fine if that's what you're ordering.\n\nWould we come back?  Maybe - if we have other friends staying locally.  \n\nWould I recommend it?  Not sure.  \n\nPlus Side:  Great patio with sand bowling.  Would be a great during the winter months.",0
"Did someone actually refer to the salsa as Ketchup?! Oh hell no!! The salsa and chips are by far the best I have had in the valley. I was surprised this place got such mediocre ratings. I have been going here since I moved to the valley and it's always reliable.\n\nThe location is great because it is so different from anyplace else; Mexican or not. Tucked back of 16th st in a more residential area, the patio is great and there is always room even when it's busy.  The service is always good and then there is the chips and salsa. I don't see how anyone can knock it, it's always fresh. The more pico inspired salsa is chunky and has a good amount of cilantro. The hot red salsa is more of a paste but more authentic and delicious with some heat. The flour tortillas chips are always warm and delicious. Most of the time I load up on chips so much I just get a Tostada and a beer or house margarita. \n\nWhen I used to eat chicken and dairy the chicken chimi fundido was something I always went for. I get the veggie burrito on occasion now but that isn't anything great, it's got plenty of veggies but nothing to write home about(if my home was in Mexico). The veggies in it aren't what I think of when I think Mexican, it has carrots, cauliflower, etc in it. No peppers, onions, etc.....oh well.\n\nI would just give it 3 stars if I didn't love the chips/salsa and location/ atmosphere so much. That bumps it up a star in my book. \n\nSalsa is like ketchup? Seriously? Sorry...I can't let it go.\n\nOh yeah, for awhile in 2008 every time my girlfriend and I went here it seemed there was always a wedding party, high school reunion, or other annoying large group gathering. In 2009 we haven't seen as much of it but be warned, you can usually still dine, but half the place is reserved and you have to deal with horrible band or MC music and exhaustingly obnoxious people.",1
"Aunt Chilada.. You bad se\u00f1orita.. Here's your grade.. No bueno.. You get an F.. I drove all the way from my hood to go & visit you across town.. You treated me like a step niece that you hated ! \nDrink order took forever.. & was wrong.. No H2o.. Despite 3 , yes 3requests.. Order was wrong., took a bazillion million minutes to get.. And the waitress was not a happy girl.. Nope, Aunt Chilada she was not.. And your chips were stale too..

Was she getting her nibbles & snack on across the way with my card.. ?? Well.. Sorry , but you let me down..& it'll be a long time before I visit your casa again...",0
"When the Chris Parker Project plays, Aunt Chilada's is a pretty good time, but the food is just so-so. They use fideo and beans as regular sides, but you can sub other sides with no charge.\n\nOur menu:\nSpinach enchiladas\nChicken tacos\nChicken enchilada\nFideo\nRice\nRefried beans\nHouse margarita\nMargarita w/Tres Generaciones and Grand Marnier\nChips + salsa\n\nSpinach enchiladas were mushy and flavorless - probably frozen spinach and too much cheese. Chicken enchiladas were so-so, a little heavy on the sauce.\n\nTacos and chips were great - flaky, made fresh, good eats. The salsas were both pretty tasty - one chunky and one smooth and spicy.\n\nBoth margaritas were pretty good and not expensive. Sounds like Aunt Chilada's is good for sitting at the bar, drinking, and eating chips while you listen to the band. Go elsewhere for dinner.",0
"As an (inexplicably) popular Phoenix destination, I've dined here over the years and been reasonably satisfied.  Service is tolerable, speed is tolerable, ambiance is tolerable.  It's a little overpriced for the quality but I was able to swallow it.\n\nUntil tonight.  My group was seated out at a patio table which had the umbrella still on it so we were sitting in shadows.  We asked for a candle for some light- \""""We're out of candles, I guess we're not doing candles on the tables anymore.\""""  The guy graciously removed the umbrella from the table which helped a bit.\n\nIt was downhill from there.  Slow service on drinks, constant creepy lurking interruptions from the waiter, condescending comments during 2/3rds of the tables orders.  Snooty oblivious help from the woman who brought out our orders.  (If the people you're sending out with food can't answer simple questions with anything better than a blank stare, *MAYBE THEY SHOULDN'T BE CARRYING OUT THE FOOD*)\n\nContinually empty water glasses and slow service to the end, I left satisfied only in the knowledge that I will never patronize this restaurant again.",0
"Hands down the BEST chips and salsa in Arizona. The flour chips and the salsa are soooooo good. Seriously - SO good. Its fresh and chunky and to die for it. Its almost worth going JUST for the chips and salsa and a margarita. I'm shocked that Aunt Chilads only has three stars - its one of the better Mexican restaurants in the Valley for many reasons. \n\nIf you want an ambiance that makes you feel like you're in Mexico - this is the spot for you. Sit outside and you're surrounded by a cute bar, plenty of seating, music and lush greenery that just makes you feel like you're in a Mexican Cantina. I think they even had bocce ball. The margaritas are great and the food is good too. No complaints here.",1
"There are so many more places you can spend your hard earned cash and get a much better meal. Telling the truth is not slander.  \n\nYes, the chips and salsa are good. They, however, are not the meal.   I find the food to be bland with a mushy texture.  For example, the picadillo tastes like something you could buy a mix at a grocery store and make at home.  \n\nThe restraunt is cute-looking, but dirty.  The rafters have dust bunnies.  The last unfortunate meal I ate there, we were seated by a group.  The restraunt was not busy at all.  The server never came to collect my card so we could leave.  I ended up taking it to the hostess.  If you want sub-par food, sucky service, and a dirty restraunt do go here.",0
"We went to this restaurant for a group meetup.  The restaurant was very good when it came to reserving and setting up our large table.  We enjoyed being in the company of others.  That said, the food was sorely lacking.\n\nTheir chips and salsa are supposedly \""""award winning\"""".  In all fairness, the mild salsa was unique.  It had a wide range of ingredients in it and was  tasty.  The spicy salsa was indeed spicy but there was nothing about it to make it stand out from other Mexican restaurant salsas.  The chips were unusual.  Some had the consistency of a deep fried pie crust.  In other words, they were very flaky.  Yet others were like chips found in other restaurants.\n\nFor my drink, I ordered a frozen mango margarita with salt.  The mango flavoring was faint and there was very little salt on the glass.\n\nFor dinner, I had a combo plate --- one chile relleno and one chicken enchilada.    The dish came with refried beans and \""""fideos\"""" (noodles with a meat sauce).  The chile relleno was the worst one I've ever had.  It held together very poorly.  For example, when I was less than halfway through it, I cut off a piece with my fork and out came the entire remaining chile!  What was left was the batter and the jack cheese!  The chicken enchilada was generous with the chicken portion but pretty forgettable.  The fideos were certainly a unique touch and pleasantly flavored.\n\nThe restaurant was very good when it came to accomodating those in our group who were vegetarians.  They were willing to substitute sides that had meat in them for a vegetable side dish.\n\nService was friendly, prompt and helpful---no complaints there.  That said, I certainly won't go back when I'm in AZ.  Without going into too much information, the whole meal left me with a bad case of indigestion.\n\nThere is certainly much, much better Mexican food to be had in the Phoenix area!",0
We went here on Sunday around 6pm.Its was practically empty we got our seats out on the patio and waited and waited for service.............finally she comes out from inside takes out drink order ok done brings it back and takes our food order we asked to start with dinner salads then proceeded to order our meals.Less then FIVE minutes later out comes our meals no salad we ask the girl where our salads were and she says I work in the kitchen I don't know where your salads are.OK excuse me...MMMMmm Forget the salad now we wanted it first not after.I bite into my Flautas YUK!!! They had to have been microwaved the meat was rock hard and the tortillas were like rubber! We complained but all we got was you don't have to pay for the salads well I guess not we never had salad!\nWE have been going here for years and this our  first bad experiance and very bad it was.,0
"Bad, just bad.\nFood is underwhelming. My friend did not like her wine after one sip and asked the waiter to exchange it for something else. He actually balked and said he would have to check with the manager before he could do that. What???Are you kidding me? Big mistake. Then I tasted my incredibly weak margherita, all sweet, horrible. Yea, they sell you an 18oz. drink, but whats the point if it sucks. Decided not to deal with the bartender directly instead of flustering our waiter again. Walked up to the bar and in a very calm, and nice way explained to the bartender that I was underwhelmed with my drink, that it was too sweet and I could not taste a hint of tequila. Well I guess tha was an insult, and instead of dealing with me as a customer, she told me that she made the drink and there was basically nothing wrong with it and nothing she could do. Really?\nThis is the type of badly run, corporate restaurant I cannot stand. No owners to deal with, no one that cares, just crappy service and a culture that forgets about the customer. Owners need to go into a Houston's and see how a large corporate restaurant should be run.",0
"I just left this restaurant 15 minutes ago and decided to sign up for Yelp to write this review. \n\nListen, Aunt Chilada's, before tonight... was a mediocre restaurant near where my boyfriend works. We'd sometimes go there for lunch if we needed a quick bite, and the salsa was good. So it was there to fill our need if we really had nowhere else to go. That being said, tonight was a disaster.\n\nI'm sure it's because they had a few large groups of people who'd already sat down before us in the banquet room, wherever that is. But we waited for over an hour for our food. When it arrived, my burrito had cheese in it (I am lactose intolerant and asked for none). The waiter was courteous and zipped back to get me my correct order, but came back a mere ten seconds later with a cold burrito. Really? I know I've already waited, but at least give it to me warm.\n\nAll in all, the server generally ignored us because the table to our left was angry they weren't getting any food, and the table to the right of us had a solid 30 people in it. So, I get it in a sense. But it would've been nice to have them tell us straight out that they had a 46 person table on the other side of the restuarant that just ordered, and that the giant party to our right hadn't gotten their food yet either. It would've saved me a lot of time. Definitely was not worth the money, and never will return again.",0
"I went to Aunt Chilada's on a gorgeous 80 degree day in December, so we were able to sit outside. The patio is pleasant and plush with lots of plants, flowers, birds running around, and a fountain. As many of the other reviews said, the chips and salsa are great! Since my date and I ate so many chips, we decided to share a fajita, which was good but nothing special. The service was respectable and our water glasses were always filled. I did not drink, but I saw a few margaritas go by that looked quite tempting!! I also heard they have bands on the weekends, which I want to check out sometime. It was a great dining experience and the atmosphere on the patio was wonderful! I would definitely recommend going here on a nice day so you can sit outside.",1
"Look elsewhere, would be my advice.\n\nFirst of all, the much heralded chips and salsa were half-chips and half-tortilla bowls. Not a fan of that. And though it was nice to have a bowl of hot salsa and another one of milder, the mild one had olives in it instead of just being a good salsa fresca.\n\nThe combination platter was good, but I forgot to tell them I wanted black beans and rice instead of refried beans and those noodle things (fideo?). My fault for not telling them, but it would be nice to be asked, when it is an option on the menu.\n\nWhich brings me to my third point, the service was pretty bad. Guy at my table asked for a second beer, never got it. Salt was delivered on the glass of a margharita even when it was requested not to be. It took forever for them to even take our order.\n\nThe best thing is that their outdoor patio is really nice, when the weather is good, especially.",0
"I give this place one star, begrudgingly. The only good thing about this place was the ambiance and the service at the bar. I am appalled by the service we had at the table. I have never been treated so badly. We had a party of 6, and we chose a table on the patio. The patio was really cool and full of party goers, mostly large groups of people. We sat for about an hour and a half without a server, so we got our drinks from the bar.  No big deal.Finally we decided we wanted some food, so a member of our group flagged down a waitress. Big mistake! The server, Cindy, was the WORST! She was so rude. She explained that no one knew whose table ours was, so no one waited on us. My sister tried to order and she snapped at her, \""""I am waiting until everyone is ready to order!\"""" I suggested maybe we should order from the bar and then she snapped at me, \""""You cannot order from the bar! You have to order from me.\"""" We ordered our food and, after several eye rolls, Cindy left our table. I seriously should have talked to a manager because she was so rude to our party. She continually rolled her eyes when we ordered drinks. The food came and it was awful. I ordered the shrimp tacos. They were completely dry and almost inedible.  I will never go back to this establishment. I cannot believe the treatment we received. This woman should not be in the service industry. I would think, in this economy, there are plenty if servers who would have wanted to wait on a party like ours. We spent $200 at table, not even counting the drinks we got at the bar. We are all upper middle class people; there was no reason Cindy would have thought we would not have tipped her well. I always give servers the benefit of the doubt; I was a server for 10 years, so I understand they have bad days. But this behavior was inexcusable and shocking. Cindy was the rudest server I have EVER had. I cannot even explain it in words. It wasn't what she said, it was the condescending tone, eye rolling, and abrupt responses.",0
"I was browsing Yelp and saw all the bad reviews of Aunt Chiladas. I laughed because of all my bad experiences there myself. \n\nEvery time I have gone there for food I have had a horrible experience. They have very limited choices for vegetarians. Now, I understand Mexican food is not vegetarian friendly. I am half Mexican myself. I know refried beans and tamales are traditionally made with lard and sauces and rice often have stock in them. I am usually able to ignore it if I can't taste it. Or a server will be able to offer me vegetarian options. \n\nEvery time I have gone there and ordered the vegetable burrito or cheese enchilada combo, the beans tasted horrible. The last time I ordered food there, I was with a very big group of family and friends. I ordered the bean and cheese nachos. The beans tasted and horrible and I asked the server what was in the beans. He said there was bacon in it. I told him I was a vegetarian and ordered the cheese quesadilla. He informed me that there was lard in the tortilla. I told him I would stick to the chips and salsa. He told me there was lard in the chips. I asked him if there was anything without lard and he yelled at me (in front of the whole restaurant) that everything had lard in it. I sarcastically asked him if my margarita had lard in it. He smiled and said no. \n\nTo be fair, I have gone there just for drinks in the bar a few times and had a good time. The bartenders were always nice and they had good bands playing. \n\nSo imagine my horror when I found out my high school reunion was going to be at Aunt Chiladas. My $40 ticket included a buffet full of lard. At least 2 drink tickets were included. But I wasn't going to let a bad restaurant ruin my night of reuniting with my high school chums. So I had a good meal beforehand and hung out around the bar all night. The bar staff was great and I had a wonderful time. :)",0
I love this place.  Frozen Margarita's are the best and they do not short you on alcohol at all.  Love the chips and salsa and the best item I think is the fish tacos.,1
"Hmmmm... got a message from a manager/owner of Aunt Chiladas regarding my review. Still not sure how I feel about it.\n\nShe informed me of the new vegan/vegetarian options on their menu and told me which items contained animal products. Helpful. I guess... \n\nBut then she said their refried beans are made with bacon which is \""""traditional in Mexican cooking.\"""" Maybe traditional in YOUR family. Keep in mind my mother is Mexican. She said growing up her mother would refry beans in lard. But bacon? Nope. Bacon was a luxury. And after several members of the family became vegetarian my grandmother and other family members still made some pretty damn good beans and tortillas, lard-free. \n\nShe then went on to say that the menu chosen by my high school reunion committee was not a menu I would have chosen for myself if I would have known the other options. Sigh. I have been a vegetarian my whole life. When I see a Mexican buffet, I can usually count on chips, salsa, beans, and rice. But the waiter who yelled at me said EVERYTHING had a meat product in it. And this was way before their \""""new\"""" menu came out with vegetarian options, including vegetarian black beans. \n\nHer apology was half-a**ed. She apologized for my \""""experience\"""".  She didn't even apologize for the unbelievably rude and mean behavior of the server who yelled at me for asking about vegetarian items.\n\nAnd one more thing I forgot to throw in my previous review. At my reunion, the bartender they had in the banquet room was awful. A rude, angry bitter old man. Just warning anyone who might have an event here. Luckily the party moved to the main bar and the staff there is awesome. See? I give credit where it is due...",0
"Nice and accommodating wait staff. That was about it. Parking is weird. The front entrance is not where the parking lot is. It's on a side street. Then when you walk in you have to keep your kids from putting their hands in the algae filled fountain. I think the goldfish live off algae. They do wedding receptions there if you're into that sort of thing. The salsa and chips are overrated. The carne asada burrito was horrible. It tasted like charred asada. The kids liked the kids menu, but I've definitely had much better Mexican food. Please clean the algae filled fountain. Goldfish deserve better!",0
"Atmosphere is fun; food no different than Mexican restaurants elsewhere (even Boston - Borders Cafe has better food). The chips might have been the worst we have had. We were expecting more given all the hype. And all the other reviews. Since this seems to be a chain, maybe we just had a bad experience at this specific one.",0
Been going to Aunt Chilada's for over 10 years now and I'm sad to see the quality of the food and service declining.  I had my wedding reception on the patio 11 years ago and could not have been happier.  Went for dinner last weekend for my wife's birthday and don't know if I'll ever go back.  Our group waited over an hour for our meals to arrive and during that time our waitress only came to the table once to take drink orders.  No one should have to leave their table and go to the bar to order a drink.  The one time our waitress did come by she said there was a mix up with our order.  When it finally arrived 3 of us asked for side of sour cream.  Unfortunately it never came.  Luckily for our waitress we had a large group so gratuity was automatically added to our bill.  Otherwise she would not have seen much.,0
"Nasty. Terrible service, hotel food. Save your money or go to via de los Santos up the road!",0
"Yep. Still sucks.\n\nWent their recently for a friend's birthday. Didn't want to but it was for one of my oldest friends and I didn't want to disappoint her. \n\nI only ordered drinks and had some chips and salsa. Drinks were good but the chips and salsa weren't great. The server seemed annoyed I wasn't ordering food, but do you blame me with my past experiences? I had a taste of my friend's cheese enchilada and vegan black beans the staff is so proud of. Not impressed.\n\nYelpers please keep in mind that some of the 5 star reviews you see posted for Aunt Chiladas quite possibly may be an employee. How do I know this? Because I got a message from an employee after my last update. She said that she knows which bartender I am talking about that was rude at my HS reunion and said \""""he is really great, just not for banquets.\"""" She also said \""""I do not know why any server would yell at you, that is just ridiculous.\"""" And my personal favorite \""""And yes, there is bacon and lard in our re fried beans. I have no hispanic background, so I am not sure what is traditional. But they are pretty tastey.\"""" But then she says \""""\nWith that said, I really hope you come back.\""""\n\nDirect quotes. And this employee has a glowing 5 star review for Aunt Chiladas and she says nothing about being an employee. Isn't this breaking some sort of Yelp rule? And what business does she have messaging me unless she is a manager? \n\nSorry but I wouldn't trust any Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix area that has less than 4 stars. There are many better choices.",0
"A tasty blast! Games, music, good food, great drinks and an authentic, uplifting atmosphere (especially the huge patio!)  I'll be back for sure.",1
"Ate dinner here a week ago.  They advertised a free buffet for happy hour but turns out it is nothing more than chips and salsa.   They also have a fruit platter but who is going to eat that with the cantaloupe killing so many people. When we saw the \""""Buffet\"""" we decided to try dinner.  Did not like the food. Just a tiny step above fast food.  The side dish was sone kind of noodles but they were cut up in about 1 inch pieces.  The beans were mashed and I almost gagged on them.  The chile relleno was the best part of the meal but still not up to par with the Barrio Cafe,  I do not plan on going back here again.  Can't believe their quality of food since they are located in a high class neighborhood.\nTheir adsvertising photos below are terrible.  Photgrapher used very bad lighting and it shows.",0
"We went there this past weekend.  There are always private parties going on during weekends, so be prepared to wait to get seated.  Once we got seated, we were right in the middle of traffic, which was not very pleasant.  My husband ordered a chimichanga, which he was not impressed with.  I ordered the fish tacos, which were really good.  We do love their salsa and chips.  \n\nIn the past we used to come to Aunt Chiladas frequently.  The atmosphere is fun and laid back.  We felt like something had changed this past trip, aside from the menu.  We didn't get that warm fuzzy feeling we used to get while visiting.  I don't think we will be back.",0
Best tortilla chips I have had even if the salsa is half ass. The entrees are also above average and the ambiance really does give you that Mexican cantina feel.,1
"My friends go to the free buffet most Fridays after classes so I joined them.\nI was excited because they rave about how good the food is and the drinks are cheap!\n\nHOWEVER....the buffet was set outside on the patio where it was freezing so the food was cold and gross. \n\nWhy would you put uncovered hot dishes outside. Sternos cant keep up with that.\nI guess starving students are less likely to notice cold food??\n\nI would rather pay than eat that buffet again.\n\nMakes me wonder how their regular quality and care to food temps is.\n\nNot excited to try that again.\nCute outside space, games and places for dogs.\nSpring may be a better time to enjoy this venue",0
"We were invited here with some friends and the food and drinks and service were alright.They were not terrible, but not worth going back for. Just very cheesy and greasy and I am sure a fat and calorie bomb!",0
"Forgive me Aunt Chiladas! I`m so ashamed to admit that I live in your neighborhood, have been coming here forever and just now writing a review! Better late than never!\nOk what I like about this place: Best Happy Hour around- drink specials and free buffet! On Fridays they have live music and it gets packed. On beautiful weather the patio areas are great to be hanging out!\nSundays- awesome brunch with a chocolate fountain.\nMargaritas- frozen, on the rocks, top shelf, etc- love them here!\nChips and salsa- love the flaky, crispy chips here! Not a real fan of the chunky salsa( I like mine hot!) but you get two kinds- the chunky and a red mole style which is spicer so me likey!\nGrreat  place for groups!!! And the patio is dog friendly!\nFor Cinco De Mayo- come here! All day live music fest!!\nps, the inside is more intimate for dinner, I am a fan of the sour cream and chicken enchiladas! I love coming here!!",1
"We went with family who go here on a regular basis and were underwhelmed. While I see the appeal of the all you can eat Happy Hour, the rest of the experience left a lot to be desired.  If all you want is a couple of drinks and a couple of small plates of free mediocre tacos - then by all means, knock yourself out.\n\nWe wanted an actual dinner so we went to the other side of the restaurant to get a real table away from the happy hour crowd. And there we sat, with nothing but chips and salsa, for at least 25 minutes. Two different servers took orders and attended to other tables within view and not one person even acknowledged our existence. When we attempted to get their attention, we were ignored. We finally got up and left and went elsewhere.  Based on the menu options and the quality of the food at Happy Hour, I'm willing to bet there are probably a dozen other Mexican restaurants in the area that offer better food and service.",0
"Attended a yelp event here tonight with my boyfriend.....never been here before. The food was excellent and it was served buffet style. Had beef tacos, taquitos, tamales, chicken wings....followed by fried ice cream, sopapillas and flan. All of the food was wonderful, tasty and packed with flavor. Enjoyed all of this on the outside patio.\nWill come back again.",1
Was here last night for a Yelp event.  \n\nReason for the missing star - The handicapped stall in the ladies room on the patio - Its door latch/lock is broken.  Couldn't keep the stall door closed.  \n\nBeing almost 30 weeks pregnant and maneuvering in a regular stall - Not fun.  \n\nOther than that - I've always loved this tucked away location!!  :),1
"Aunt Chiladas hosted the latest Yelp event and what an event it was. The food was excellent. i was especially partial to the tamales...ate several. the chips and salsa at each table were excellent as well. the margaritas from the bar were nice and sweet/salty, just the right ratio. \n\nwe'll definitely check them out again for their regular menu!",1
"I've had waaaay better Mexican. I grew up across the way from the barrios in Santa Ana so I know me some good Mexican.\n\nPros:\n\n-Cute outdoor decor. That was it.\n-the cheese crisp was ok.\n-they had flour tortilla chips that were pretty tasty and a nice change from corn.\n\nCons:\n\n-Food was not good. I can make better Mexican, and I'm Asian.\n-ceviche tasted like frozen shrimp mixed with salsa. \n-drinks were watered down. I ordered a margarita and it came with a side tumbler so I was excited until I tasted it...watery. \n\nVerdict:\n\nWould not go again although it was fun following the chilies on the path back to my hotel.",0
"What the hell?  I have never experienced a restaurant go down the toilet so fast.  Its like a bad night in mexico.  Service sucked, but the food sucked more.  if by chance you want the blandest food this side of england, this place is for you, but if you want any form of mexican fare, you'd be better off going to taco smell, and I am no fan of fast food, whether it be from north of the border or farther north of the border.  I used to be a big fan of the Aunt, but I can confidently say I will never, ever give this place another try, it was really that bad.",0
"I love this place! The atmosphere is really great, especially the patio when its not too hot outside. The bocce court is a plus as well. I've been here to watch sports events as well as to hang out with friends on the patio; Aunt Chiladas is good for both! They have a wide variety of beers as well as really great margaritas. I've never been disappointed with the food, although the service has been a little slow at times. I'm not sure of the exact schedule, but they also sometimes have a free food buffet outside!",1
"Well, got off to a bad start.  We were told that the wait would be 30 minutes, was closer to and hour and fifteen.  We were shuttled from the Arizona Grand so leaving wasn't a good option for us.\n\nFinally we were seated, two of the staff recommend the spiced pork.  I did not think much of it, but everyone I was with seemed to enjoy their meals and the portions were ample.  I wish I would have ordered something else.",0
"I am giving Aunt Chilada's a four because the service was outstanding and the chips and salsa were good.  Not sure of our server's name (table 35 or 36 last night) she was funny and excellent.   Even sang a little song about the food for us.  The food is average at best.  Nothing noteworthy, just standard food.  The drinks were good and they had live music playing which was nice.  It is a good place to drink but I would think twice about eating there again, unless I wanted an average tasting meal.",1
"1. They may be open until 2am, but they don't serve food after 10:00 PM.  It would be nice if this were listed somewhere on Aunt Chilada's website. \n\n2.  Who puts black olives in their salsa? Maybe this is some sort of Tex-mex thing. But as a native southern Californian in love with Mexican food, I have never experienced such a thing.\n\n3.  The fideo was super soggy.\n\n4. My family went for lunch on a weekday.  There was some sort of work banquet going on in a back room.  There were possibly two or three other families eating in the other main rooms.  Our server seemed to be working hard..every time we saw her.  Unfortunately, there were times that she disappeared for way too long.  \n\n5. Half of the orders placed had something wrong with them.  I ordered black beans and was given refried.  Every family member with a chicken dish complained that the chicken was drier than wood.  My sister ordered a salad with chicken and received one meat-free. We didn't ask for corrections, because considering how long it took for us to get any food, we would have had to wait to dinner to receive the corrected meal items.\n\n6. The wood bench, manikin and old blanket in the entry way sorta smells like musty cat urine.  I think it is long overdue for a cleaning.\n\n7.  I have been to this restaurant many times over the years. I was sad that this last experience was so marginal. Overall, the food was okay--worthy of three stars. The prices and quantities were good.  But the inaccurate orders and the lacking service (which I think comes from being understaffed instead of bad skills) drop this place down to a two.  I will update my review when/if I ever return.  Until then--go only if convenience dictates that this is the best place for you (you are staying at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak resort without a car), and go with the expectation that you will be there for a long time.",0
We visited Aunt Chiladas patio because we wanted to bring dogs.  We were welcomed so nicely!  They have a whole area dedicated just to dogs so you are sitting with other dog friendly people that come.  This is such a great place to sit and relax and have lunch.  The food is fantastic.  We are vegetarians and they added Vegan fajitas to their menu.  They were fantastic!,1
"Food was average but I give it 2 stars because the service was terrible. I could not escape the smoke from other peoples cigarettes as we were seated outside...there are better Mexican places to eat in Phoenix. I guess that from reading all of the other reviews most come for the drinks so if that is your poison, maybe this place might work but I would not recommend eating here",0
"This place has gone so downhill. If I hadnt gotten my chips, salsa & water immediately, I wouldve walked out. Margaritas are always awesome. But the service and food is straight up AWFUL. Microwaved enchiladas, no rice, rude, cold, unfriendly, uninviting service...If you're looking for a fabulous, neighborhood mexican restaurant, try Las Glorias Grill. The location isnt as great, but the food, service and drinks, blows this place outta the water. After years of going to aunt chiladas, Im NEVER going back again. They dont deserve your money either....",0
"This is a difficult one, because I use to love Aunt Chilada's.  So here's what happened yesterday.  My family decided after much talk that we wanted mexican food, so I suggested AC, because even though I haven't been there in like 3 years, I us to love the food and service.  When we arrived around 3pm, we notice that there were hardly anyone there, my husband thought that was strange.  We decided to sit inside because the outside looked pretty lonely.  The guy at the door directed us to the right of the restaurant, there were one group of two ladies, that were leaving and us... so we wait, and wait, and wait... then a group of about 4 people sat down, and we still waiting... I notice that we didn't even have water, we looked around and there were two girls sitting to what it looks like the back area, complaining and talking, I know cause they were loud.  Out of know where comes this waiter and completely bypass us and went straight to the table that came after us... My husband looked at me got up and we left... that's when the waiter said hi... it was so bad.  What I also noticed is how dirty this place is, the fixture have pounds of dust, everything is dusty and looks dingy, so my though was, what is going on here, my husband responded, if this place looks this bad, I wonder about kitchen... sad, so sad, WHAT HAPPENED TO AUNT CHILADAS...WE ARE NEVER COMING BACK.  Down the street is Los Reyes de la Torta, is on a little strip mall, but the place is clean, service is impeccable and food was amazing... at least something good came out of all this.",0
"This place is horrible unless all you want to do is drink alcohol.\nNothing but poor service and poorly cooked food. We were not greeted upon entering and had to tell them that we wanted to be seated. We were then brought to a dining room that had ball of the ambience of a school hall with plastic table clothes included. Our server was not even closely familiar with the food or food preparation. When asked how the fideo was prepared, she said, \""""they cook it\"""".  Thanks captain obvious. My husband asked if there was anything spicy and she said the steak and jalape\u00f1o fajitas were. He then asked if anything else was and she said \""""Well, the steak and jalape\u00f1o fajitas are\"""".....she does not belong waiting on people. \nSo the food. The food is microwaved!! Soggy, gross enchilada, mushy and dry tamale, lackluster salsa, fideo that had been in a steam pan since yesterday. The highlight was the almost average fajitas. \nNo bueno !",0
Friendly service but food was just ok. Maybe an off night.,0
"This place....Oh My.....\nWell if you're a vegetarian...RUN. \nI got stuck at this place due to a corporate event my company hosted there. \nLet me say, how excited I was at the idea of Mexican food at the Christmas party. Then my vegetarian instinct kicked in when I got there....hmm....lets check for lard.\nI asked the waitress who was going around...slowly I add but it was a busy night so maybe the service is faster when there isn't a huge event going on. (I'm thinking understaffed?....hoping?) Anyway, I was then informed that they cook their beans with bacon. What? Yes. Bacon. So there went the idea of a burrito, a tostada. Depressing. I ended up eating the very \""""ehh\"""" chips (deep fried tasting and thicker than the typical chip. I'd venture to guess possibly flour chips?) \nI'm not a big drinker so the allure isn't there for the bar aspect. \nI will honestly never be back and from what the people who actually did eat there said I didn't miss anything.",0
"Terrible experience, don't sit on the patio. We waited at least 25 minutes after being seated for lunch.  Nobody ever came to our table.  Finally somebody showed up and went to 2 other tables who had showed up 5 minutes or more after us.  She didn't have the courtesy of saying \""""I'll be right there\"""". The place was slow so there was no excuse.  Not sure if the food was any good. We walked out.",0
"Great set up, great location, great flour tortilla chips, but everything else not so great.  I have tried a few different dishes, and they were not very good.  Too bad, it's a cool set up.",0
"OMG. Worst restaurant experience I've ever had in my 50 years of existence. Here's the experience went\n\n1. Right out of the gate...Our hostess who seated us told us the fruit and chocolate fountain were included with the meal. My girlfriend grabbed two pieces of melon and two strawberries.When our waitress did finally decide to show up 10 minutes later we both ordered a cup of Albondigas soup without rice. She made a snotty remark that we should get the bowl of soup because the cups were small. She then barked at us that if we don't order an entree that we would have to pay $8 for the four pieces of fruit. I said whoa, hold on. We are ordering entrees. She replied that a lot of people come in just for soup. All of this is going on while my girlfriend and I are still reading the menu to decide what we wanted. I want to know what other people just ordering soup has to do with us.\n\n2. After 30 minutes the entrees arrived. I complained that it took way too long and the waitress said they had a large party and that is why the food took so long. Mind you I ordered 2 enchiladas and my girlfriend ordered a gound beef tostada and it took 30 minutes...no shit. How hard is that to make? I told her that we are just important as any other customer in the restaurant. She sent the manager over and he said the same thing. Large party sorry. I told him I don't care about the large party. Not our problem. That was it...he walked away. I looked around and the place was practically empty.\n\n3. I ordered beans and rice with my meal. The waitress didn't even have enough courtesy to listen to me. She brought me fideo (mexican pasta) instead of rice.She also brought fideo and beans for my girlfriend who ordered her tostada ala carte.and charged us for it. When my girlfriend ordered just the tostada the snotty bitch complained that my girlfriend wasn't ordering more.\n\n4. After trying to eat what was very poorly made food (we couldn't eat it because it was horrible) we went to pay the bill and noticed extra charges. We complained again. This time the manager did not come to talk to us. He told her to tell us the meal was comped. Since we couldn't eat that crap, that was fine with me. My girlfriend was going to taste my enchiladas and without asking one of the bussers took my plate away.\n\n5. Finally I asked to speak with the manager and a waiter called him (Marty) and the manager turned around and yelled across the bar that he was too busy. He LITERALLY yelled it. Then he noticed me standing there and said Oh, I'm sorry. I replied no I'm sorry that you are too busy. I told him I would never return. That was the last straw.\n\nThe waitress was a snotty bitch and never checked on us once except to give us the check. We had to ask other wait staff to get our waitress more than twice. If you are smart you will not waste your time or money at Aunt Chiladas. Over rated and over priced. This place should be out of business.\n\nOh and the Chocolate fountain is disgusting. I've seen people pick up the fruit with their fingers and cough and sneeze in it.",0
"Had dinner on a Monday night. They weren't real busy. We had called 4 hours earlier to get a table for 12. They were not set up for us when we arrived. The dining area was about 25% full but they had to take 15 minutes to put a table together, by the fireplace. We had to have them turn the fireplace off as it was too hot.\n\nDrinks ordered and it took another 15 minutes to get any of them to our table.\n\nI tried to order Huevos Rancheros which is not on the dinner menu. Other mexican restaurants will normally make this. Not Aunt Chilada's. The waiter said the chef would chew him out if he took any special order to the kitchen. Again, they were not busy and they have Huevos Rancheros on their weekend breakfast menu.\n\nI've eaten at this restaurant before when visiting Phoenix. This was by far the worst experience of all from the service to the food and just the general attitude about us as customers.",0
"Somewhere between BAD & BLAH...\n\ndescribes the bland food our group had here. The setting is very nice & the margaritas are good but that's it. The food was very bland, lukewarm, just disappointing. Usually so-so Mexican food can be made more tolerable with some salsa but even the salsa here doesn't help. \n\nAlso, if there are unruly children using the bocce ball court crashing the balls into the wooden frame like when we were there, it makes the lovely outdoor patio a much less desirable place to be.\n\nDefinitely will not go here again.",0
"WHY does this place have bad reviews!?!?!? \nThis place is awesome. I literally have never had mexican food this good....EVER!\nFirst of all, they have not one, but TWO types of chips for their chips and salsa. The flour torilla chips are the bomb. I could've eaten all that they had. They have black olives in the salsa. Seems weird, but it is delicious! Guac=fabulous. Had margaritas and they were of course great! We both got the pollo fundido per our waiters recommendation. I was mindblown at how good this was! I am still dreaming about it! I cannot wait to return here! We sat on the patio with other visitors and had a ball!",1
Nice place in the middle of a residential area making it a quaint local spot.\nReally enjoyed the Pacifico on tap ($4.25/glass) and the Nachos gustivo pequeno ($9.00 for small).\nA bit pricey but still a fun place.,1
So dissatisfied we went to Denny's afterwards.  Sour cream and lime extra charge for your tacos?  Not going to eat here again.,0
"It was 5th meet up for the The Breakfast Club UYE and this time Aunt Chilada's was picked. We sat out on the patio, thought why not while the weather was still ok.  Aunt Chilada's has a farm fresh breakfast menu you can order from, but they also let you order lunch if that's your thing. Another plus, they accepted reservations for breakfast. That made things so much nicer. We were a party of 10, so any time I can get a reservation in, its helpful.\n\nOne of the things I noticed was the salsa had slices olives in it, that's interesting, went well with the chips though!\n\nWith our breakfast we also were able to have items from the chocolate fondue fountain, and you be believe I had some chocolate covered strawberries, pineapple, lady fingers, marshmallows, oh and more strawberries, and this was before I even ordered breakfast! haha\n\nI have to say service was a little slow, but there was a couple of big party's at tables, who would have thought on a sat morning, this was the spot, there was even 2 parties  for Monica, that other Monica must have been cool to pick this spot haha.\n\nI ordered the egg burrito, past few breakfast clubs I have been to a breakfast burrito or 2 have been ordered so I have just been craving it! This burrito had scrambled eggs, cheese, potatoes (my top 3 favorite things in a breakfast burrito) and I added chicken to it and asked if they could throw in some jalapenos in it for me!  I wasn't expecting much other than a breakfast burrito, but when it came out I was shocked, it was a huge burrito, and had home styled potatoes, refried beans and the burrito was covered in melted cheese. I was in heaven!  I topped the burrito with salsa and cut into it! Omg it was delish! The jalapenos were fresh and perfect! This was a good breakfast burrito!\n\nIf you hadn't thought of Anut Chiladas for breakfast, you should and go give them a try! The Farm Fresh Menu has plenty to choose from. And I have to say I did see the yogurt and fruit dish, and omg it was the best looking one I have seen, fresh layered fruit, just beautiful in color, topped with yogurt and granola, it looked amazing.\n\nAgain thank you to everyone who attended The Breakfast Club!! It's always a pleasure sharing a meal with you guys!",1
"Checked out the famous happy hour on a Friday version and also was told this was a decent pick up joint. Neither were as good as the hype. The buffet is free yea, but you better get there early to avoid food poisoning. The chaffing dishes are left open (due to long lines?) and the flies, which are all over the place, can have a field day. It was a cloudy day on Friday, but if its hot and sunny and the flies are around and the food is exposed, it all could be the perfect storm. And what is up with the tiny plates? You got people doing all kinds of balancing acts with one plate of ground beef, another with taco shells and some even trying to balance a third plate with a potato burrito I think and some fruit and broccoli. Give us bigger plates - we are adults. Tried a few tacos and they were OK. Beer prices were good at $3.25 a bottle and they had a band play later.\n   This wasn''t  a pick up place either unless you like your women over 60. Lots of retirement parties on this night, but the overall crowd age was over 50. Still, can't beat drinking outdoors in nice weather, so that is a positive for sure.",0
"Have been there many times over the years and always thought it was decent food and a cool place. Went with my daughter for dinner recently and it was the WORST Mexican food I have had for ages, No chips were serve or offered. My chimichanga tortilla had the consistency of wallboard. My daughter's chile relleno was all coating and no filling, I can't remember now what else she had, but it was equally awful.  Her beans tasted old and sour. The pasta dish they serve instead of rice was bland and really not improved by the stale frozen peas. I also paid $2 for less than a spoonful of guacamole on my chimi.\nI had a reasonably ok impression of the place before--cool environment, if a little run down, nice location and outside amenities, fair Arizona/Americanized Mex food. Nothing spectacular. Wow. what a let down. It may have been a bad night, but when EVERYTHING is TERRIBLE, I'm not moved to shrug it off and try again. The beer was fine, but for $40, I would rather go to one of the -Bertos's drive throughs. I'd get MUCH better food and a lot f it.\nMay you have better luck, but in the area, you are better off with El Bravo or even Ajo Als.   \nBased on my last meal, I would give this place NO stars if possible.",0
"I will summarize my wife and I's experience with Aunt Chilada's in one word: BLAND.  It was pretty forgettable.  I will say that their flour nachos were scrumptious, and if you find yourself there, grab some.  \n\nOur food was nothing but soggy tortillas slathered with melty cheese.  No seasoning whatsoever.  We were on vacation from New York and we had better Tex-Mex there.  I only hope we can find the real Tex-Mex or actual Latin food in this area.  \n\nAlso worth noting the wait staff was not very good.  Our hostess and waitress both served us in regular old street clothes and did not look professional at all, and their  demeanor more or less matched it.  They checked in on us only as etiquette required and disappeared as soon as we wanted something.  The only saving grace was a nice youngish waiter who helped us out even though we weren't his table.  \n\nThe rating says it all: don't settle for Aunt Chilada's,  at least not on Monday nights.",0
"I hadn't been here since the yelp event last year. The chips and salsa are to die for and it it took everything in me not to eat all of the, since I call myself being \""""good\"""". I did order the shrimp tacos (sans the tortilla) which were delicious and the service was great. I will definitely come back again to see how things are during happy hour and heck just for the chips and salsa.",1
"Pathetic translation for a restaurant.  People heed to the Yelp stars! Waited 35 min for food, we walked out. The service was so so bad.  The salsa was horrible, tasted like a can of El Pato chile.  The waiter was perspiring and kept wiping his face with hands & touching everything! Disgusting! Hostess were high school rejects lacking customer service.  The restaurant is dark the ceilings are filthy.  We never got  passed the chips & salsa.  Thank God we walked out when we did! Will never return.  I give it 1 star for diet Pepsi. There is an abundance of excellent restaurants in area.",0
"Two words: chocolate fountain. Two more words: TORTILLA CHIPS. Let me elaborate. FLOUR tortilla chips. They're incredible. Like, can't stop eating them incredible. They're like little triangles of heaven melting on your tongue. Salsa, guac, hot sauce, it's doesn't matter! I eat them plain! By the handful! I actually dipped the tortilla chips IN the chocolate fountain.\n\nBut I'm getting ahead of myself. The decor at Aunt Chilada's is rainbow cactus chic. Not a dull table or view from anywhere in the restaurant. The service is top notch. You can tell a lot of people have been working here a while which makes me believe they treat the staff well. The plates of food are large, complete with refried beans, pico de gallo, lettuce and cheese. All of which you can scoop up with the TORTILLA CHIPS FROM GOD.\n\nBut really, the food here is incredible. The chocolate fountain is on Sundays for brunch. And the tortilla chips are all the damn time. It seems a bit off the beaten path, but well worth the drive. It is a must-go every time I'm in the area. Go forth and salivate.",1
"This place has changed a lot!\n\nThe addition of the outside, tiki-esque bar and boche ball give this place a much more relaxed feel.\n\nI came here for my very last Breakfast Club UYE. We came specifically because the chocolate fountain is included w/ brunch. Quite honestly, I couldve done w/out it. A bit too sweet, but the fruit was good.\n\nOur large group was seated on the patio, thankfully, while the patio weather was still bareable. Our waitress was a bit slow, which was puzzling considering we were one of 3 tables in the entire place. She did a good job keeping all of our checks straight though.\n\nThey have a good number of selections on their brunch menu. I chose the Mexican eggs benedict over the traditional. This one comes w/ chicken instead of Canadian bacon. It was really good, though Id go for the traditional next time due to the dryness of the chicken. The hollendaise was seasoned nicely though, and the eggs poached perfectly.\n\nId definitely recommend this for a brunch spot, especially if you have a major sweet tooth.",1
"Five words: Back Patio, Happy Hour, Friday\n\nFirst: Back Patio. There are two patios at Aunt Chilada's. One is in the front when you walk in, with a bocce ball court and an outdoor bar. The other is through the restaurant in the back. I recommend this back patio. It's very large - on warmer days they have the misters flowing freely, and the cool strung lights at night. The trees around it make it feel somewhat secluded, and as the temperatures go down, this is the perfect spot to have a margarita or beer.\n\nThat being said: Happy Hour and Friday should really go together. During the week, Aunt Chilada's has happy hour snacks for free. Usually enchiladas, chips and salsa, etc. But on Fridays, they step it up 5 notches. The happy hour food goes on the back patio, where you can get chips, usually taco meat, beans, enchiladas, veggie tray, fruit, salsa, etc. for free. They continuously refill the free food while it is happy hour, so don't fret if the enchilada tray is empty. \n\nOne of my favorite patios in Phoenix.",1
Lets just say it kind of sucked. Stayed at the Pointe across the street and heard good things.  The beer was the best part.. which was bottled.. not here. I do not even remember what I had it was so good. Puffy chips? Who the hell wants wierd puffy chips!? Go somewhere else. On The Border is almost better Mexican food... and that place is terrible!,0
"Eh. The food isn't so great here. I like the combo of corn and flour tortilla chips, but that's about it. It's a fun place, but I wouldn't ever choose to go here.",0
Enjoy it here and regularly get good service. Have enjoyed a large variety of menu items over the years. Great meal for after a long day at the pool.,1
"I really want to like this place and continue to return time and time again year after year. The food is pretty bad- there I said it. The chips are great, the salsa is hit or miss. \n\nLove their margaritas and the place has a great feel to it, but the staff is not trained too well. The exception to this are the owners and management. For some reason, they are great, yet the help doesn't seem to follow their lead. \n\nI will continue to go back, because it is close to home, but this is far from a favorite of mine.",0
Don't count on the bartenders acknowledging you unless you are sitting at the bar. I watched two seats at their bar remain dirty and empty for 20 minutes.  Like they are too good to clean it. They weren't even that busy.,0
The worst service they attended the Anglo first I was there with the family and the customers that were eating were starring at us and talking shit behind our backs so uncomfortable never going to this place again first and last,0
"Good service and God awful food!!! One star b/c of great service brought it up... And could not go lower. \n\nOMG the food was horrible and lacked taste at best.  The guac was worse than what comes from a bag!! \n\nWe had a table of 8, service was great! Food weak bland, lacked interest or taste. The only dish that appeared worth ordering was the street tacos. \n\nThe jalape\u00f1o steak fajitas were tough as leather and well tastes the same. \n\nHow does a place like this survive in Phoenix?  Oh must be east coast tourist, well thank goodness for them. \n\nThat is all.",0
"Invited by friends to go here for dinner on a Sat night and read all the Yelp reviews beforehand to try to get an idea of what food to order (most of the reviews don't really talk about any good/bad particular dishes).  The place looks old and outdated, especially for a hotel type restaurant.  We were seated out on a back side patio which was fine until BIG winged bugs arrived after we ate.  Anyway, the frozen margaritas were good and I ordered the Street Tacos, which were okay but the beef in them could not have been cooked anymore as it was tough and not very tasty.  Chips and salsa are pretty good.  Our group of 7 all ordered different things and no one had had rave reviews or bad comments about their dishes. We ordered flan, fried ice cream and sopapias (sp?) for dessert, which were all polished off.  I live in the Valley and given the multitudes of very good to great Mexican places we have, I don't need to return to Aunt's.",0
"HUGE ROACH CRAWLING UP THE WALL! They didn't even kill it because it got away  a table next to is said casually, \""""oh there's another one?\""""So gross food wasn't good enough to deal with that",0
The food here was very good. Something that myself and our entire group enjoyed were the complementary flour chips and salsa. We all agreed that it was some of the best we've ever had. The service was okay but we didn't see her very much and we felt pretty rushed to order. Overall we enjoyed the food and the atmosphere.,1
"I was here a good 10 years ago.  Service and food was great back then.  My how things go bad so quickly!  First thing that set me off was nothing has changed in 10 years and it looks like a few things need repaired.  The wait was about a half hour.  My son almost fell after sitting in a broken chair.  Finally we were seated.  The homemade chips were good but the bottom ones were store bought.  The old put the store bought chips on the bottom trick.  I should have walked then but everyone was tired of waiting and hungry.  My son is a picky eater to say least.  I ordered a cheese quesadilla for my kid.  I specifically told the waitress, NO ONIONS, NO TOMATOES, and NOTHING BUT CHEESE.  I even told her if he finds one it will cause an incident.  She seemed to understand. The food I ordered was OK.  I had to use my salsa to make it a little hotter.  I can eat fire so this is no surprise.  My son's cheese quesadilla had tomatoes in it.  At first I told him it was just one and I picked it off.  Then he kept finding them in every slice.  I called the waitress over and explained.   She apologized and took the plate back.  A few min. went by and the waitress had the NERVE to come out and ask if it was just one.  I had already told her it had tomatoes all over in it.  At this time I felt humiliated by her actions and told her just bring a cheese crisp and I'll pay the difference.  It took a while for that to get to our table but all was OK.  While we ate a waiter dropped a napkin bringing food to another table.  When he came back I thought he'd pick it up after almost tripping on it himself.  Nope, he left it there so someone else could trip on it.  He came back a few minutes later so I flagged him down and let him know about the napkin.  Instead of saying \""""oh I'll pick it up right away.\""""  The African American waiter boomed in a very loud voice how sorry he was and it would never happen again.  He was loud enough for everyone to hear in the room.  Again, I felt humiliated.  I guess not wanting the restaurant to get sued because some waiter won't pick up a napkin was asking too much.  The waitress did comp my sons food.  I will never go back.  At one time that area had some very nice places.  The area had CLASS.  That's not the case anymore.  5/10/14",0
"I was a bit hesitant to return. My last visit left me feeling a bit cold.\n(A new-ish girl working the outside bar was giving a LOT of her attention to a particular patron, and drinks, food, etc. was slow coming)\n\nMarvin was our server tonight. He's got LOTS of energy.\n\nHad a carnitas chimichanga. Delicious, as always!\n\nLove the flour chips, and the hot salsa.\n\nI will be back.",1
"My friend Katy and I walked into Aunt Chilada's restaurant At Squaw Peak on 6/28/2014 to have a awesome dinner. The place had a few parties going on, but as usual it seemed under staffed. So my friend and I sat down and we were given chips and salsa and a bottle of water. About 5-10 minutes later a family came in with small children and after about 5 more minutes or so all of sudden a waiter comes out and looked me right in the eye and went to the other table and took their order. Turned around and went back in to the kitchen. Of course this pissed me off. We got up and hostess saw me I explained what happen she said it was her fault. That did not make it OK. The waiter should have said something to us and didn't. So we left Aunt Chilada's in discuss and went down the road to Ajo Al's for a awesome meal and great service..",0
"Disappointed. Food was awful, not good at all. Tried it once and probably will not come back again. I will go else where for real quality food. Service was blah. Overall, not a good experience. No thank you!",0
"I've been here a few times. Very cute atmosphere. I definitely recommend it. I came with a very big group today, everyone around me loved their food. I had to send the soup back because if was luke-warm. However, they were very quick to make up for the mishap, and the service was excellent. My friends were all thrilled with their meals. The tortillas before the meal are excellent as well.",1
Hidden off the 51 & Glendale. Big place & big patio. Meh food. Chips & salsa ok. Skip the queso. Vegetarians BEWARE everything is made w/ meat. Beans AND noodle stuff. Ugh. Safe w/ grilled veggies. :(,0
"my friend and I went to dinner tonight and it was great; they had a live band in the bar, \""""The Real Thing\"""", who were amazing; the reason for the one star was because of a waitress who ruined our night!  We were in the bar at least 20 minutes when we finally waived the waitress down (who passed by us at least six or seven times ignoring that we were even there), and ordered drinks. The waitress, Jessica, was totally rude and seemed to be irritated with us before we even ordered. She was obviously having a bad night and took it out on us.  What's happening to common courtesy and customer service?? Jessica shouldn't be in this position if she is going to have such a disrespectful attitude toward the general public, leave it at home...",0
HAPPY HOUR SERVICES SUCKS! been here two hours and yet to see a waitress at our table (3 top),0
"We had the nachos which were good, they were suppose to have chicken but I think we got one piece of chicken.  The beans were bad, they tasted as though they had just opened the can and poured them on the nachos.  I asked the waitress for some flour tortillas because I believe that flour tortillas tell you a lot about a Mexican restaurant especially those who claim they are authentic, homemade.  Their flour tortillas were AWFUL!!! She gave me like 3 or 4, they were all stuck to each other and these flour tortillas were not homemade.  I have bought some from the store that were way better. Don't bother with this place.",0
The food is awesome. I love the fish tacos and the creamy chipotle chicken. The only downside to the restaurant is the servers & the cleanliness... Or lack there of..if the waitress's became a little nicer and the restaurant a little cleaner..I think they would increase in ratings and business.,0
Myself & family had horrible experience at this establishment. Bad service's not enough waiter/waitress. The food is no where nearly as good as Tempe location. This place is mostly enjoyed by non-locals that don't know Mexican Food. The employees pay better attention to non-locals (folks that are staying at The Point). I rather go to Tempe location which is much better. Never coming back to this establishment. Not recommended.,0
"A terrible HH!! We brought 20 people for a pre-homecoming party... All purchased alcoholic beverages- some ppl multiple beverages .. Food consisted of three banquet trays( one nacho, one enchilada, one chingalinga) HH was suppose to last until 6.30 food stopped at 5.45. Servers kept pushing he expensive stuff . We will head somewhere else with our dollars .. Great example of sad hour ... Nothing happy her",0
"Be very careful - watch your wallet and don't listen to the waitress - she will tell you they have $3 specials and then charge you $7!!\nFood was so-so, I did like the fried flour tortilla chips.  But the red chile burritos are beef and not pork.  They don't serve rice, the pasta like side with carrots and peas is marginal at best.\nBut its the bait and switch happy hour menu you have to be careful of.  They offer a $3 house margarita, but will charge you $7 saying you ordered a \""""BIG\"""" margarita.  Save your money and go to Carlos O'Briens, Macayos or Top Shelf.",0
"There are many Mexican restaurants you could go to in Phoenix.  Most of them are very similar with the menu and flavors.  I put this one above most.  The food is good, the menu has everything you would expect to find and a few you might not.  But the atmosphere and service put this place high on my list.  I really enjoy the mix of chips you get.  Some fluffy some crisp.  Yum,,,",1
"My husband decided to take us out for lunch and he picked Aunt Chiladas. The decor is so cute right when you walk in, very cheerful. We went for lunch so it was quieter. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. Now the best part....the chips! They were delicious, some of the best chips I've ever tasted. They weren't greasy or over-salted, but so good. I had the machaca taco salad which wasn't served in a taco shell so took away some of the guilt from eating all those chips. It had a scoop of their guacamole in it which was also delicious and creamy. My husband and son had the beef and cheese enchiladas which were served in a delicious red sauce. The regular side is a pasta called fideo, but they opted for the traditional rice and beans. I loved the food, the atmosphere and the service was good too. Definitely coming again.",1
We have been here twice in one week after just moving into the neighborhood. We love it! The staff have been friendly both times and the food has been excellent. The chips and salsa are amazing. I've never had flour chips before and they are delicious. The place itself is old and rustic and if you don't mind that then please give it a go. The price you pay for the quality of food is outstanding. Big thumbs up. If I could give 4.5 stars then I would!,1
"I've shopped here for awhile......I love, LOVE this treasure of a store. Very friendly owner (Nanci). I follow her store on Facebook and love reading up on all the updates and specials they have. I even told her what I was looking for - for my daughters bedroom and within 12 hours she had pictures sent to my e-mail.\n\nI highly recommend this place is you are looking for treasures! :)",1
"Very fun little vintage shop.  You never know what you will find here.  There are quite a few vendors who bring in a wide range of merchandise.  I have purchased a beautiful antique console, I brand new Tommy Bahama Travertine Console as well as a lot of vintage and rustic decor.  It's always fun to stop in and see what treasures I can find.  Very affordable!",1
"This place is great! Literally it's businesses like these that Yelpers need to know about! Such great stuff at really low prices. Screw IKEA for inexpensive furniture shop here and get great stuff that nobody else will have. I can't even begin to list how many awesome pieces I've gotten from here but one of my favs is an beautiful oriental end table that was $15. Another time I got a vintage sign for $7 that people have begged me to sell to them (can't blame them, it's pretty cool). \n\nAlso, the staff is so friendly and nice but not in an annoying paid-on-commission-way- but in a we-love-our-store-and-what-we-sell kind of way. This place is nestled within a few antique stores but Everything Goes is by far the best. It can be overwhelming since there is a lot of stuff but try to focus on one thing at a time. Also, don't be afraid to buy a chair with ugly fabric or a dresser painted and ugly color; use Pinterest to DIY a facelift. I don't even live close but it's always worth the drive.",1
Love this place and always find something to bring home. The people here are the friendliest and most helpful salespeople around. They know where everything is and dig out stuff from the back if they think they can help you. Love the selection and the prices too.,1
"I rating 5 stars to counter the hysterical person who unfairly gave a bad rating. \n\nAlthough I have not been in this store in YEARS, I have a situation where I need them. I have had 2 cats disappear, both had tags identifying that they were fixed and had info on the tags to return them to their owner (me). I just recently had to spend $150 on one of my cats who appears to have a stab mark. Initially I though it was a dog bit but the vet shaved back the hair on the wound and said it looked like a knife mark.\n\nI know my neighbor has an extremely bad temper. He beats his dogs because I can hear him clearly. He's always yelling in his house. To make a long story short, I am afraid my cats bare the brunt of his temper. I know my cats jump on his car and he absolutely hates it. I heard him say \""""get the f*** off there\"""" and chase one of them. He looked surprised to see me quietly sitting in my chair in the front yard. So, two animals I loved and spent money a lot of money on are gone forever, and another one has a knife wound. I think it's time to start pointing some hidden cameras. \n\nTo the rude person above. THIS IS HOW THEY STAY IN BUSINESS EVERY MONTH BESIDES OCTOBER.",1

"My Girlfriend had a kidney stone - this location is 100 yds from John C. Lincoln hospital.

"We worked with Karen for the decorations and rentals for our wedding. Our ballroom for our dinner was not going to be available until during the ceremony, so I needed to hire someone to place my decorations and centerpieces while I was getting married. We met with Karen and discussed our preferences. She was very friendly and asked a lot of questions to clarify our vision for our decorations. Her office/store was pretty disorganized, and I found it easier to contact her via phone, rather than by email. On the wedding day, Karen constructed and decorated our chuppah and placed our centerpieces on our dinner tables, in addition to providing the table linens. The chuppah was beautiful, and our centerpieces were exactly as I had communicated to her. The only small negative thing was that we requested and paid for a unity candle holder for our ceremony. I didn't realize it hadn't been provided or placed until just before the ceremony, so our taper candles had to be laid down. Overall, I had a good experience working with Karen.",1
"I found Karen on Yelp and Wedding Wire. The price was awesome, flowers were gorgeous and Mandap was Amazing.  Karen was creative and responsive to my requests.  Score one for style and my budget.  Even my wedding planner was impressed.",1
"Incredibly disappointing! I think that this was the worst decision I made for our wedding. She didn't provide enough flowers and yet her quote increased at the wedding, and though the ballroom looked nice, the rest of the ceremony and event looked cheap and/or empty and/or full of glitches (thing falling apart, things left fallen by the alter..etc). She's nice but for the price we paid, we were so disappointed. I've just spent a lot of time in the floral industry lately and realize now how much beauty and care could have gone into this event but didnt. For what we paid, I've seen stunning weddings with lush florals and it saddens me when I think about what we got. Honestly, three years later, I still feel disappointed in the wedding flowers she provided. I would not recommend her.",0

"Kinesphere is an amazing place...the instructors are fantastic.  Dominika, Melissa and Lisa teach from the heart...with great precision...passion...and years of experience.  Kinesphere rocks!",1
"As far as fast food, this place won all the stars. We didn't use the restroom, so I do not know how nice or clean they are, but we were in a hurry and this place fit the bill.\n\nIt looks pretty new an neat, I kind of liked the decor.\n\nOur cashier Cathy was super nice and friendly, we used a coupon from the Entertainment Book and it was a breeze.\n\nI took a few steps and it felt like our food was ready within seconds... We had found a nice table and we eat really fast, overall I estimate we spent like 10 minutes there and our order and food must have taken like 2 minutes -see my review about JIB, by Cave Creek and Beardsley : (\n\nAlso, I admire people that are attentive to their customer's needs, while we were getting our drinks, I overheard another cashier (Sofia I think) ask a group of customers if they wanted an extra chair, and think she went and got them one from a table nearby... I thought that was really nice.\n\nAlso, when I got my coffee the lady that gave it to me made sure I got the cream and sugar I needed (I had a bad experience with this on the McDonalds at Cave Creek and Beardsley once, where they ask you when you place the order and we left just for me to find out my coffee had no cream, no sugar : (\n\nAlso, there was a long line at the drive-through, and some times we have had an issue in other places where they help the drive through customers really fast and those that went inside have to wait longer... Does not seem to be an issue here.",1
"For fast food, list location is pretty nice. They get you in and out pretty quickly and I've never had a problem with the food. It also feels cleaner than most fast food restaurants I've been to. Maybe because it's a fairly newer location. My son would give it five stars because he loves their happy meals. I like their grilled chicken wraps a lot and their coffee is also very good. When I'm craving iced tea you can't beat their $1 pricing. Overall I'm a fan! As good as fast food can get!",1
"While the drive through service is great at this location, going in to eat was another story. Went in on Saturday around 2pm. The lady that took our order was not paying attention and was turned around talking in Spanish to what looked to be her manager the whole time. We held out our card for a while before she turned around to continue processing our order and really made us feel like we were bothering her. Everyone continued to goof around and speak only Spanish very loudly. I understand if there is no one inside but to continue to crack jokes/laugh in another language in front of guests is inappropriate. I will never go in to eat here again.",0
"Service was fast.  The food was freshly prepared. I was happy with the cleanliness.  Monica, the counter person was exceedingly helpful.",1
What a wonderful place! The workers are so helpful! They were able to resize my wedding ring (bc after I gained all my baby weight it didn't really fit anymore) Thanks guys! Keep it up!,1
I've rented from this Uhaul 3 times. It is fast and affordable and they don't try and upsel you a bunch of crap you don't need. Mike has been here a long time and he is very helpful and friendly.,1
great place been renting trucks for years and they always have propane and its not super expensive,1
"The owner was agitated on arrival,aggressive, rude, i tried to rent a Trailer and a truck to pull it, then he tried to tell me that the truck does not come with a \""""ball hitch\"""" and I would have to buy one at 30-40 dollars including tax additional to all rental costs of both.  I said that this is unreasonable and a \""""rip off\"""" this infuriated the owner (wears Glasses) and shouted i am not in the business of ripping people off and said to go elsewhere........ gladly i did.  Do not do business with this guy....you have been warned......",0
"Ok so I was going to a movie and I really wanted a coffee.\n\nThe nearest thing was coffee plantation.\n\nI got a cup, one sip and I was the keystone bitter beer face guy!\n\nThis coffee was like if Propel made coffee water.\n\nThis was the most watered down coffee I've ever tasted in my life.\n\nNEVER DRINK IT!!",0
THIS LOCATION IS NOW CLOSED.  Not that anyone was thinking of going there...,0
"So B of A was the first bank where I ever opened a checking account or had a debit card. Maybe it was the aggressive advertising aimed at students that didn't know any better that sucked me in, but it was a great deal for them.\n\nI think their dream client is a jackass teenager who forgets to check his account balance before he writes rent checks and pays phone bills so that he'll dip a few dollars too far into his funds. That way they can tack on an extra 25 or thirty bucks the next time he pays a dollar and 88 cents for a slurpee at seven eleven, and so on and so forth. \n\nYeah, that happened to me. I don't bank with them anymore.\n\nThough, I should say, there is the occasional good hearted teller who may cut you some slack around the holidays. They represent the second star.",0
"Bank of Wasting My Time is what their name should be changed to. I recently opened an account online with Bank of America. After nearly completing the application, my computer timed out. I didn't want to resubmit the application and have my credit pulled again, so I called their online technical support to see if they could verify that my account application had been received. But due to their crappy system restrictions, I was told that I would need to wait three hours before they could tell me if the application had been completed or not. \n\nThe following day, I received an email stating that my account application had been approved, and documentation would be sent to me that I would need to return. I don't live at the physical address provided (in the process of moving), and they wouldn't accept a PO BOX, so I wasn't able to pick up the paperwork until about a week later. \n\nGoing through all of the mail items (5 separate pieces of mail!), I found the signature card letter, debit card, debit card instructions, debit card pin number, and then a letter stating that the entire account had been closed. \n\nI called customer service to find out why the account had been closed, and the girl on the phone (who sounded like she had marbles in her mouth and was incapable of properly reading the script that was no-doubt right in front of her) told me that the account was in the process of being closed and nothing could be done. I asked why the account was being closed, and she told me that it was due to suspicious activity. I asked her to tell me what the suspicious activity was, considering I hadn't even signed the paperwork for the account yet, and there wasn't any money in the account. She told me that it was suspicious I hadn't returned the paperwork right away. It had only been a week since the application had been submitted online, and somehow that was suspicious??? \n\nI asked to speak with a manager, and have currently been holding for 50 minutes. Unless you have buckets of time to waste with this financial disaster, DO NOT open an account with Bank of America.",0
I love this location. Very small bank that does not have a large amount of traffic. It is one of the friendliest neighborhood banks in the valley.  Today I went in to open a small business account and was serviced by Phillip who has worked for BofA for over 10 years. He was very knowledgeable about the products which helped me and my business partner make the best decisions. His level of professionalism was top 10. I now know more about the services BofA has to offer and a new friend. Thank you BofA for hiring such wonderful people to represent your organization.,1
"Worst Bank of America! Came here today to get something notarized. I was the only other customer besides two who were already with a teller. There were two other employees on the side having a side conversation. When the first customer left, I went up to the window and the lady told me her computer just went down. All I wanted to was ask a question, but she told me to get back in line and wait until the next teller was done. Well, after waiting for another 5 minutes, the next teller (a man) was done, and I said I wanted to get a document notarized. His response, \""""I'm sorry, but you'll have to ask the two over there.\"""" The \""""two\"""" (a lady and a man) he meant were the other two employees who were having a side conversation. Well, I went up to the lady and she told me Philip was the only one certified to notarized and apparently NOW he is with a customer. Of course, after spending 20 minutes there I'm not going to wait. I rather drive to another B of A branch tomorrow to get speedier and better service.",0
Wize is a great place.  They do a great job repairing notebooks and they are good guys.,1
"REOPENED...new owner Dan ..Nice guy, knows nothing about how to run a business NOR FIX COMPUTERS!  His electricity is NOT turned on because they just bought the business and don't have the $$ for the deposit yet.  They work in the dark and then take your computer home.  I was quoted a price to repair and upgrade my computer.  It was NOT done as promised later that day nor 2 weeks later!  He had me pick it up at his house and still my computer was not upgraded and he lost my power cord and \""""rigged\"""" one up for me with black tape...Still waiting for the upgraded memory card he promised and my new card that I have NEVER RECEIVED..PLEASE stay away from this place!  You are better throwing your laptop in the trash then taking it to this place!",0
"The place is small but, I see it as cozy. There is also outside seating that is great to enjoy on a beautiful day or evening. \n\nThe owner waited on me. And made me the best Viennese Mocha, I \nthink is possible. Excellent to the last drop! I learned they roast and blend their own beans. Well someone here knows what they are doing because this was the smoothest coffee drink at a coffeehouse I think I have yet to have. And hey ... I lived in Seattle for almost twenty years I have been to some coffeehouses, let me tell ya! \n\nI went to their website www.GrindersCoffeeCo.com \nIt's a great little website. It explains the place well  ,as well as their coffee and I also learned they have a rotating art showing on the walls that change the 1st Saturday of each month and jazz or  blues playing on the patio the 2nd Saturday of each month. \n\nI might just be there for this first Music night in 2010. Say Hi if you see me around there getting my caffeine buzz on anytime.\nI'll try it again before I give them a five star rating.",1
"There are so many great things about Grinders!  Rotating Art from local artists (and not the ones trying their hardest to win the next hipster award), live music with great jazz bands, excellent coffee and tea reasonably priced. The fourth star is awarded for the pecan/cream cheese Danish thing the server recommended. It was so good I couldn't decide weather to scarf it down or savor each bite.",1
I popped into Grinders yesterday afternoon (a bit after lunch time) for a pick-me-up.  I just love this neighborhood gem.  There's a nice comfy vibe and the staff is welcoming and accomodating.  They patiently fielded my questions about available sugar-free syrup options and happily indulged my request for a combination of syrups for my iced latte.  It was fantastic!\n\nI've recently been informed that they host blues music on the 2nd Saturday evening of each month.  I can't wait to check it out next month.,1
"Grinder's is a great little coffee shop in the Sunnyslope district.  Each week I purchase my two pounds of coffee that has been roasted in their shop (the roaster is part of the decor).  The staff is always friendly and lets me know what is the best roast that week.  Since my tastes change, sometimes going for the super dark roast or perhaps a lighter flavor the next week, they help me pick out the best bean.\nThis little shop is full of locals and in the afternoon, be prepared for the Sunnyslope High School crowd.  The staff is sometimes a bit slow getting out orders, but they make up for it with friendly service and a great product. Another place where they get to know their customers by their names!",1
I love this place. It makes me happy.,1
"Little gem tucked into a horrible shopping centre. I loved that they had the roasting equipment and fresh beans out in the open, as proof they roast their own coffee. They had plenty of roasts on offer as well as some home made treats in the case. \nI got an iced mocha and a mini cinnamon roll - both were very good. The coffee was very smooth and rich in flavour, not overpowered by milk or chocolate like some espressos can be.\nFor locally sourced, freshly roasted, the prices are your pretty standard Starbucks prices which is great - I'd honestly expect higher. Definitely recommend if you find yourself in the area.",1
I was at coffee shop this am asking for an iced vanilla latte which was listed 2nd on their wall menu for $3.55.  Gal told me it was not what I wanted and that the person I was getting it for would not like.  Told me it was only milk and vanilla and I could make at home.  She went to make laughing at me.  Her manager told me that they would be happy to give me money back if I left.\n\nI have been to their concession at John C Lincoln Hospital which is good but will never recommend this rather dirty worn shop to anyone.,0
"I wanted to like this place ever since I drove past it on an exploratory drive through the Sunnyslope area.  Based on it's location, it seemed like it might be less pretentious than some of it's other centrally-located peers.  After several visits, I am glad to give it five stars for being one of my favorite coffee shops in the Phoenix area.\n\nOn my first visit here, I immediately noticed two things: 1) the roasting equipment and raw beans displayed prominently, indicating that they did indeed roast their own beans and 2) the prices, which are lower than the average coffee shop (I'm thinking Starbucks, which came to prominence with a reputation for high prices but has really fallen into the middle of the pack compared with the better local places that have cropped up) and far lower than most gourmet shops.  True, you're not getting a pour over for each cup, but you know that it was freshly roasted (and ground) and it's less than $2 a cup.  The beans are the real deal, though: $10.95/lb for freshly roasted, delicious coffee beans?  I know some good places for coffee but none of them can even touch that price, most hovering closer to $15/16 per lb.\n\nAlthough I usually go for regular coffee when exploring a new place, I decided to get a latte on that first trip visit, which did not disappoint - good smooth espresso flavor and the right ratio of milk for me.  The next time that I stopped in, I asked a few questions about the beans and bought a cup of coffee.  After some debate, I went with their Bold roast, which I later found out is also their espresso roast.  While it makes for a good espresso, I found it fairly light for a \""""bold\"""" cup of coffee, and after adding just a splash of cream it tasted somewhat watered down.  In the future I'd probably go with one of their other roasts, particularly the Double French.  This is a mix between their dark Sumatra roast and Tanzanian peaberry.  I was a little concerned when I purchased it, as the barista told me to \""""wait for the oils to come out on the beans.\"""" Though I don't know a ton about coffee, one of the things I thought I knew was that oily beans = ruined beans, but after making it at home on a French press, it quickly entered my upper echelon of coffees.  I also picked up some single source Guatemalan while I was there, a brighter and somewhat less flavorful roast, but still excellent.\n\nCompared to many of the other places in town, this place is perhaps a bit dumpy, but it's got good character and the baristas are super friendly and helpful.  They display art in the store and even have a special night for it each month (Second Saturdays?)  It's also very quiet and has outdoor tables, so I could imagine getting some work done there unlike more popular and louder shops.  I'll definitely be getting beans and drinks from this place in the future.",1
"The best fricken caramel macchiato! Love their service, always friendly.",1
"Very Cool coffee shop! Features local art, and is a very cozy place to go. Coffee  is completely delicious! Good bagels too!",1
Coffee is ok. The sandwich is mediocre like you can make it at home for $7? I don't think so. I expected more. Their employees don't have uniforms but they are way too sloppy eve looks dirty. On a tank top all sloppy it doesn't look professional. I know it's a coffee shop but it says a lot. I like how they have the different coffee beans decor on the wall. That's pretty cool. Prolly won't come back,0
"Groovy little coffee house where they roast their own beans from all over the world.  Very friendly service.  Nice, easy, laid back, quiet atmosphere.  My coffee latte was goood! Outside shaded area to sit.  I like this place!",1
I love supporting local businesses. Grinders has great coffee and amazing people working there. I always get an iced coconut latte.,1
You get what you pay for. I may as well have let my kids paint my toenails. Not to mention the tech was rough and cut/pinched several of my toes during my pedicure.   Not impressed. I definitely won't be back.,0
"I went here because my normal salon was booked and I really wanted to like it. The salon is rather large and had nice pedicure chairs. My spa pedicure turned out great. The gal did a nice job and im happy with my pretty pink toesies! \n\nMy gel manicure, however, has left me debating if I should go somewhere else to get it fixed. (See photo) I asked for grey and the color is more brown. I also asked the gal not to use an electric nail drill to get my old polish off and soak instead but she did it anyway. My polish is uneven and she didn't get the sides very well. They are also filed uneven. I tried to say something but she didn't speak english very well, so I gave up. Super bummed i'm stuck with these for 2 weeks unless I want to go somewhere else and pay.\n\nThe price was good - 25 for the pedi and only 20 for the mani and the massage was great, but I certainly wont be back any time soon.",0
"They usually do a pretty good job on my nails but they don't like it when I bring my kids in.\nEvery time I bring my 8 year old daughter in there to get a pedicure with me, they put us about 3-4 chairs a part!! The whole point in going to get a pedicure with my daughter is to spend quality time with her, hold hands, talk about her friends and boys she likes, etc...Not have to scream to a chair in the distance.  They act like they are mad when I ask for us to be together and it is such a bother.\n\nAlso, the male owner always insists on doing my nails and he is so rough with me and actually gets on to me if my hand isn't loose enough. I keep telling him I have problems with my wrist and it hurts and he is still super rough!!\n\nI only go there when I have to because of convience!!",0
"I was in a wedding and needed to get my nails done, so the bride and everybody chose this place, probably because they were cheaper. But, depending on the service I got, I'd much rather pay a few extra dollars. \n\nThe area was kind of ghetto, and the spa itself wasn't very clean or welcoming. They were so understaffed/mismanaged that when I went in, I was greeted by a man who was already working on someone else's nails; he couldn't be bothered to get up and check the schedule or anything. \n\nThe lady who ended up doing my pedicure was nice, but then the one who ended up doing my nails wasn't very friendly, even though I tried to make small talk with her. Their magazine choices were also limited to OK and People, so if you don't care for celebrity gossip you're screwed. Overall the service and location were subpar, and the prices weren't all that great, so I will probably not be going back.",0
"Do not go to this nail shop. My friend and I went there for the the first time this weekend. It took more than three hours for us to get gel manicures and regular pedicures. My friend's nails were so bad that she had the lady redo several of them while we were there. Then her nails chipped the next day so she had to go back. Now three days after my gel manicure my nails are chipping so I'm going back to get them first. Also, I got polka dots on two of my nails and the lady charged me $5 for them. I've never been charged by any other shop when I got polka dots on only two nails.",0
"Gosh, I'm embarrassed to say I eat here. But Pei Wei, is a predictable, safe and tame alternative to figuring which Chinese take out places haven't violated any Maricopa County Health Dept. codes.  Amen on the more preferable wait vs. its monstrous cousin PF.  Personally, I dig the orange peel chicken and minced chicken lettuce wraps similar to the big cousin, but much prefer the more laid-back environs here.  Go Pei Wei.",1
"This food is Americanized Chinese food-- not challenging, not different, and certainly not offensive to the American pallet. The food tends to be very salty (which Americans tend to like). It is dependable pedestrian food, the place is noisy, the parking lot crowded. \n\nThere are better places to eat Chinese than any of the Pei Wei's in my opinion.",0
So disappointing.  I do not know what happened to this place... it has progressively gotten worse over time.  I ordered the Mongolian Beef with brown rice-- my very favorite and it didn't taste very good.  It was okay- but just not as good as usual.\n\nThe 2 star is for my dish and the zero stars are for my fiance's soppy noodle mess called Chicken lo mein--- ewwwwwwwwww!  I think Ramen noodles tasted better and cost only 11 cents.  They were so mooshy that they barely could stay on the fork-- really gross.  They were tasteless.  We threw it out.  \n\n\nPei Wei-- I miss the good times.,0
"Hmmmmm..... Chinese? I think not. If you are expecting a great meal, go elsewhere. Pei Wei is a good not so fast version of fast food. It isn't fine dining, but it certainly serves a purpose. I'll always pick Pei Wei over a fast food burger, and how anyone can go to Panda Express when this is a couple blocks away is beyond me. Pei Wei is also a bit overpriced for what it is. \n\nFor a long time before the airlines went insane over carry on, i used to bring a Pei Wei kids meal as my personal upgrade. It's small, well packed, and used to make the other passengers jealous. \n\nI don't go to Pei Wei so much anymore. Long lines and inadequate service keep me from venturing in their door on any whim. I will order ahead and pick up. They rarely get my order right, but whatever i get usually tastes pretty good. I just never go with the expectation that I will get my correct order.",0
"Pei Wei is adding a new concept to their lineup - \""""Pei Wei Asian Market\"""". The menu has removed all the soups and most of the noodle dishes. Portions have been reduced and sandwiches have been added to the menu. \n\nThe good news - the decor and the layout are quite nice. \n\nThe bad news - I just really don't get it. It is like Pei Wei with a few odd items and higher prices. The portions and prices have been reduced, but seems to be more expensive. Also, they have removed the kids menu.",0
"The portions are too small, the plasticware just reminds me of Jack In The Box, the serving tray is right from a mall food court, and the menu selection is drastically reduced.  You can't really enjoy conversation or relax at lunch listening to the kitchen scream out order numbers to the customers.  The flavor mixing softdrink machine is fun, but gimmicky.  The food quality and flavor are the same for the most part, but you do leave wanting more...\n\nI won't be returning to this location.",0
"OK,..I am the biggest Pei Wei fan you know,..I promise! But aside from the decor, PW Asian Market is a HUGE downgrade from PW Asian Diner.\n\nNegatives:\n-100% of food now served in boxes? What the? You can't wash a dish, or real utensils? \n- Portion sizes,..easily 1/2 of what they once were, price only slightly less. :-(\n- Call out your number to pick up your food? Really? Whose idea was that? Nothing says \""""hospitality\"""" like getting your number yelled out at you and dashing to pick up your food and then dashing back to your table.\n- Asian Sandwiches? Again,.. where did line form asking for \""""Somebody please bring us Asian Sandwiches\""""? They lack taste and are served on \""""bread\"""" the consistency and taste of cardboard, swing and a BIG miss!\n\nPositives:\nThe surviving six dishes from the Diner model are still awesome,. just served in micro-portions, get two they're small!\n\nI want my old school Pei Wei back! \n\nPS - P. Fleming, did you think to ask any \""""customers\"""" about your new ideas?\n\nLost without my Pei Wei,....",0
"Notice the word \""""market\"""" over the door, it is NOT a good thing. My family was thoroughly disappointed in the quality of food that was served. The portions were smaller, the lettuce wraps tasted like burnt oil, the king pao chicken was mystery meat that included something pointy. This is decidedly NOT pei wei junior, it is much lower on the quality scale.",0
Had the Korean Lettuce Wraps and an Asian Chicken Salad on 06/02. The lettuce wraps were good but the Asian Chicken Salad had a long hair in it. I sent it back and another salad was given to me without dressing. I thought I was imagining things so I had my friend taste it. He agreed there was no dressing. I got a refund and went to Paradise Bakery down the street. I really like Pei Wei but I will never go back to this location. It seems like they just don't care.,0
"I found myself at Pei Wei TWICE in the last 10 days! I normally don't like going to eat much but I couldn't resist after hair their ginger broccoli chicken dish last week. This review isn't really about the food but I love that you can now order sauces on the side and add extra veggies. \n\nI wanted to give a shoutout to JayJay ( I'm not sure if that's his real name as I asked another employee and she said she didnt know his name but everyone calls him JayJay - super short hair and glasses). He was our cashier and super knowledgeable about the everything on the menu. My husband and I asked a lot of questions about sauces, the chicken wrap and so many others. He was super patient! \n\nAnd then we came in again tonight (Tuesday) and I didn't catch her name but she's brunette with a long pony tail and has a tattoo covering her right forearm. I asked her questions about my honey chicken and vegetables and how it was such a small amount compared to last time and she offered to bring more vegetables. What a way to make someone's dining experience even better. Thank you for being so friendly !",1
"Had lunch at the Glendale location today. It had been quite a long time since I'd eaten at Pei Wei. It's not the same quality as it was when it opened. In the beginning...the food was barely second to that served at a PF Changs. It was quite good, easy to access and everything that accompanied the food was higher quality (drinks, napkins, fortune cookies, staff/bussers).\n\nI ordered a small chicken orange peel with brown rice ($6.49) and my BF ordered the large shrimp kung pao ($9.99) and we also ordered 2 side spring rolls $3.79. I believe the smaller portion option is new to Pei Wei as I'm sure they're trying to capture a larger market w/less expensive prices or portions. For lunch, the small is just fine for most, especially if you get an extra little side with it. \n\nBUT...HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SMALL AND ORIGINAL PORTION SIZE..YOU PAY MORE FOR ADD'L RICE WHEN YOU ORDER THE ORIGINAL, NOT ADD'L MEAT.\n\nPlate next to plate my BF had the same amount of meat (shrimp) in comparison to my (chicken)...his plate was larger and it had more than twice the amount of rice on my plate. So comparing apples to apples you pay $2 to $2.20 more for MORE rice, not necessarily more meat when you order an original vs a small depending on what kind of meat you order. \n\nSo...Just wanted to give you the heads up when you consider ordering small or original.",0
"Let me first start off with the fact that I literally just left this establishment. I always love take out from pei Wei so this has nothing to do with the food. It is all service. For one the building smelled like sewage which i understand can happen due to location but it took my appetite away. Second, I walked in and two young girls were standing at the counter. One was changing a roll of receipt paper a foot away from me and completely ignored me. Then turned her back to the line. The other girl was talking to a customer for about a minute  and the customer left. She then looks up at me, doesn't say a word, and proceeds to turn her back to me and text on her cell phone in plain sight for several minutes. This whole time, neither girl acknowledges me whatsoever but I am clearly standing at the counter waiting to be helped. A young man comes and asks the girls if I have been helped and without looking up the both respond no. He helps me and is friendly and fast so I am not completely furious. I still tipped the staff because I work in the industry, but I will never return to this location if this is how they are trained and managed.",0
"I was just here with my wife yesterday. I got the honey seared chicken and my wife got the sesame chicken both where very good in good size portions, however the customer services was not the best.",1
"I have only encountered one QuikTrip I wasn't happy with, and it wasn't this one. It's on my way to work, so I will occasionally stop in for gas (if it's cheap), a coffee, or some other drink. Mornings are quite busy, but their system gets the customer out pretty quickly...hence the name QuickTrip? Heh.",1
"Food City doesn't meet my regular grocery shopping needs; however, whenever I need to buy a cake this is the first place I think of! The five stars are for the the Tres Leches cake alone! \n\nA yellow cake moist with the three milks (evaporated, condensed and whole) but not soggy and frosted with a barely sweet whipped topping. Ordinarily more of a butter cream gal, myself, this frosting is the PERFECT compliment to the cake! \n\nInspired after my first try, I started experimenting with Tres Leches from other bakeries or panaderias and I have to say... Food City's was my favorite. \n\nSo, quick! Somebody have a birthday so we can get a cake!!!",1
"I was here randomly with my step-uncle one day.  It's a low key place with some interesting folks.  Mostly of the 40+ age group.  Drinks are cheap.  As far as I know, most people come here for the off track betting.  Although, I also heard the pizza is good.",0
I've been here several times - some days it's packed and other days you'll only see a few regulars. The biker crowd seems to like this place and the sports fans of course. The owners are very nice and friendly and it seems they practically live at this place. \nThe drinks are priced good and they have some nice breakfast specials too. The pizza is really good as well. We ordered the super jumbo pizza for my husbands birthday and it barely fit in the trunk of my car - if you want the WOW factor at a party; order one of these. I posted a pic of my husband holding one of the monster pizza's so you have an idea of what to expect.,1
My boyfriend and I visited Big Daddy's for lunch on a Thursday.   The restaurant is out dated and dingy on the inside.  There were only a handful of other patrons in the place when we arrived.  The waitress/bartender was not attentive or friendly to us at all even though she was not busy.  It almost felt as though we were bothering her.  The food took awhile to come out but was not too bad as far as bar food goes.  Would we return to Big Daddy's?   Probably not.,0
My new kitten got sick the first week I got her. In a panic I took her to VCA. They were so good with her. I felt very comfortable with them taking care of what ever the problem was. As well they could not be nicer to me. I received follow up calls which was great. I recommend these guys for sure.,1

First time taking Charlie here for her last shot after we adopted her. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful as well. Our doctor was great at answering all the questions we had (being first time puppy parents) Location is also perfect walking distance and next to one of our favorite breakfast joints- Scramble! Which is dog friendly :) Definitely will be Charlie's permanent doggy hospital.,1
"I am really, really picky about the Vet I let treat my pet. With that said. I have been very happy with Dr Walker.  I like the fact he gets down on the floor with Pepper during his exam., he is extremely gentle and through.  \n\nPepper has Valley Fever and Dr Walker has been working with us to get her medicine.and blood tests regulated.  Any questions or treatment options concerning Pepper's health are explained in terms we can understand. \n\nHis assistants and staff are very friendly and caring. It is easy to get an appointment and you do not have to wait long before being seen. \n\nPepper loves Dr Walker and the staff at Mountain View, she gives them a 2 paws up.",1
"Completely inedible.  Some people say the price is right, but I say you get what you pay for.  I would have rather been served dog food... at least then I would have known what it was.  Servers couldn't even open bottles of wine.  I certainly wouldn't use this company.",0
"I have used Dad's for two events, a 25th Anniversary and my own wedding. First event food was inconsistant, dry and unappetizing, service was amazing. My wedding just the opposite food was great service was a mess. Servers were late, out of uniform, in dirty clothing, standing out front smoking and drinking. Did not follow direction. A nightmare. There were major fails in both events, but the worst part is how unresponsive the management was to concerns/complaints. It was like we have your money so we don't care. I felt totally blown off and will tell anyone who will listen about my experience. I would not use them again for any reason. You really do get what you pay for in this case. Spend a little extra and use a quality caterer who will respond to your concerns and ensure that your event is what you want it to be. Don't take a chance here.",0
"Had Dad's catering at a Christmas party I attended and even for free food I felt ripped off. I would have brought a lunch that day if I knew that I would be eating canned green beans, undercooked scalloped potatoes and cheap packaged rolls with \""""whipped spread\"""". The little desert trays were good at least, and the staff was friendly enough, which is why I bumped it up to two stars.",0
"Dad's Catering was great to work with for our wedding.  We were starving when we met with them for a tasting, and we could not even finish the sample plates they brought us. \n\nAll the food we tried was super fresh and really tasty.  We got a great deal too - two free appetizer trays (we chose chips, veggies and dip) and a free 1 year anniversary cake!\n\nThey went out of their way to help us keep our budget down, never pressured us or tried to upsell us.  They were just great people all around.\n\nThe only reason they don't get the full five stars from me is that they are not that tech-savvy and that's important these days. Email communication was not their strong suit, so I felt I had to call anytime I had a simple question.\n\nOther than that, I loved their food, and next time we need catering they will be at the top of our list.",1
"I have now had this catering service food as a guest at 2 different weddings. Both times the steak was cold and the vegetables overcooked , flavorless and discolored.  The service was good as was the dessert tray.  The cocktail hour meatballs were very unattractive and strange tasting.  Other guests were afraid to try them.  I was a guest but as a recent bride I'm glad I didn't use them.",0
"There are few people in this world that promise you a price, and a time to get something done and then out do themselves on both counts. Al is just such a person! So that is the short review, here is the story. On Dec 23rd a driver that for this review will remain nameless, turned left in front of my GMC Jimmy.  His insurance company totaled my SUV over my objections... The adjuster estimated the damage to be nearly $4000. After consulting with my mechanic and 3 body shops, and looking for a replacement vehicle on Craigslist, I came to the conclusion that repairing it was still the best option, though it was looking to cost most if not all of what the adjusters estimate was. \n\nThe third body shop said that they use Al's Unibody and Frame to straighten the frames on any vehicles that they work on. So with the suggestion that he should look at this first I gave him a call. Al answered the phone and told me to come on over. He put it up on his lift, grabbed his levels, then proceeded to show me what was going on, what he could do and that if I would like, he could not only straighten the frame but he could replace the bumper, grille and headlight. He gave me a very good price compared to the estimates I had in hand. He then did something completely unexpected... he asked if I wanted to do a some of the work myself to save a bit of the labor cost. After finding my jaw and replacing it back on my face I agreed to help. \n\nThe details maybe over doing it for the review however it should be said that Al showed me what could be easily removed, brought me the tools and in short order the headlight, and grille were off the GMC, three of the bolts were out of the bumper cover. One remained as it was at a strange angle, to be removed after the frame was pulled straight. The letters G,M, & C that the body shops had priced at $100 were recovered from the broken grille, salvaged and ready for the new one.  So this part of the story comes to and end, with $50 saved and a feeling that the \""""Jimmy\"""" was in good hands.\n\nThat was on Friday, Al told me that it would be ready by Wednesday. He called Monday to tell me that the tow hook that broke off in the crash could be replace by one in a junk yard he found for 15 dollars if I would like to go pick it up and bring it to him,  or alternatively. they could deliver it for about $50 or I could get it new. I made my choice, the car was completed on Tuesday. The bill was an amazingly reasonable $1060.00.  \n\nWith about 30 years of experience Al knows what can be done, what makes sense to do, and tells me he won't do the job if he can't make it good enough that he would put one of his kids back behind the wheel. He gets all 5 stars from me, the work he did was what was asked of him, he beat his own estimate for completion in both time and money. He was so nice to work with, this isn't something you want to repeat... Having an accident sucks! Working with Al was the best part. If your reading this Al, Thank You again.",1
"I like Dr. Padrez., he's awesome.  The staff most times are just rude.  Everytime I would take my daughter for a check up,  she would have to see another dr. Because he was always booked. My daughters 16 months and she's seen her dr. Only about 3 times out of the 10 she's been to the drs. Not to mention everytime they have another dr look at her it was another 76 patient establishment charge I had to pay.  That was ridiculous.  When I called in to ask if I should bring my daughter in asap, they said a nurse practitioner will call me right back. ... It took her 2 hours to call back.  By then I had taken her to the hospital for a spiked fever and a stomach bug.   It happened more then once.  I switched drs and am very happy with where she's at now.",0
This place is fun.  You never know what you will find.  It is fun just browsing.  I found 10 great CD's for a buck each.  I even found a cool pair of reading glasses.  Last year I donated large appliances to them and they pick up.  You don't even have to be there.  They also have a lot of books separated by type to help you find what you want,1
"I don't write low reviews lightly. Today was the third time in a year I have received incredibly poor service from this store. The first time I was told they were reserving an item for an employee, so my purchase wasn't for sale. The second time, I was told there was so much interest that they were going to reprice it. (Read, they wanted more money.) Today I went in and I was once again told an item wasn't for sale, despite the fact it was on the floor and as far away from the back storage area as possible. After I left I was mad enough to call. When I talked to a manager he told me the item made it on to the floor by accident and they reserve some items for an appraiser who will buy nicer items. Seriously? Great customer service there. I told him, \""""You are a charity thrift store and not acting very honorably or with charity.\"""" I told him that if an item was on the floor and I was willing to pay, a good business sucks it up and makes the sale. Obviously I am done with this place. \n\nToo bad, because I have been shopping here for years before these last three shitty experiences and I would rather give my money to a charity thrift store than some other  thrift store out for the bottom line....like SVDP has become.",0
The prices are ridiculous here...$55 for a used bookcase that you can buy new at Ikea for $30?\n\n  I came in looking for a decent used suitcase.  They want $30 for a nasty old thing that might have cost that much when it was new.  I can not understand why they would price donated items so high.  People that shop here want a bargain and will just go and purchase something new if there isn't much difference in price.   Sad for the charities this store supports.,0
Cool funky stuff for a small chunk of change. Bought a buffet to transform for less than $60.,1
"I believe I have found the elusive... GREAT HONEST mechanic!  I stopped in to have my vehicle checked/prepped for the hot AZ months coming up.  Clean shop, great service.  Hours are a little difficult to work around working an 8 to 5 job but if my car gets this kind of great service..  I'll make arrangements.",1
I was extremely disappointed by the rude treatment I received.  I would not recommend this shop to anyone.  As a matter of fact I got a Yelp account for the sole purpose of rating this shop.,0
"Horrible service, their staff has zero customer service and are extremely slow. Don't bother going here to watch football either because you will be inconvenienced. I've been here many times and every single time I've had something to complain about. If you have no standards, this place is for you.",0
"A rare lunch at a bar during the day. I could not drink due to work, but plenty of other regulars were enjoying a beverage about 2pm ish midweek. This is a dive bar of course and its dark and gloomy inside, but all the necessary bar ingredients are present. The friendly older female bartender and the owner who was cooking and their merry band of daytime regulars. The menu is not rocket science and I ended up going with the slider special, which included three sliders with cheese and onions and a hot portion of steak fries or whatever usual side you want. It was only $5.95 and well worth it for the money. The DBacks are probably always going to be on the tube and it's more of a neighborhood bar obviously than a destination bar, but it worked out well on my pass through town.",1
"I came here with a group of 12 on Saturday morning for breakfast. We all arrived at separate times and agreed that the signs directing you to the restaurant were confusing. All of us got lost, but the detours enabled us to tour the beautiful resort. The Pointe Tapatio is gorgeous, wonderful cliffs, great design... Now if only the restaurant could improve..\n\nOnce we were all seated we waited (and waited and waited) to order. The server appeared to take our drink order, perhaps not realizing we had been sitting there for over half an hour and were prepared to order food as well. When he finally returned we were salivating hyenas, yet still more than half the table were unhappy with the meal placed before them.\n\nWhile we waited an eternity for our food to arrive I looked around the restaurant and noticed how dirty it was. There were 3 separate tables where it looked as though they spilled a pitcher of ice on the floor and didn't bother cleaning it up. We actually saw a busser carrying a tray full of glasses with OJ spilling all over the floor, we called it out to our server but he was nonplussed and took no action.\n\nOn to the food:\nMy personal experience was the best. I ordered an egg, ham and cheese bagel, they brought it out cold with the cheese unmelted. I asked the waiter to have the cooks throw it under the broiler, he rolled his eyes and took my plate. When he brought it back it was still cold and instead of melting the cheese they removed it.. Message here.. If you complain \""""No cheese for you!\"""" At this point my party had finished eating so I ate the cold $12 bagel. \n\nPointe in Thyme was a major bummer and very overpriced, I will not return nor recommend it to others.",0
We ate here for Sunday brunch while staying at the resort and I was very impressed all the way around.,1
"I wish I could give it no stars. I had lunch there, and the service was terrible. I don't think I ever got a refill on my drink. Also, I went with 6 people and not one person liked their overprice food. The fish tasted like it had been soaked in grease and had no flavor, the soup tasted like someone just threw tomatoes in the blender and there was just nothing good about the place. Skip it, even if you have a free voucher from the hotel.",0
"Difficult to find.  Annoying bar setup with mostly garbage Bud/Miller/Coors products like Blue Moon, and they had the nerve to serve me a Guinness in a frosty glass.  Service was a bit slow.  Prices were reasonable though.  Old building on the outside but decent inside.",0
My wife and I had lunch here yesterday. The food was so salty it was almost inedible. Expensive sodium! Don't bother.,0
Stayed at the hotel for 4 days. We ate breakfast here everyday and one dinner. The dinner left a lot to be desired. I ordered filet medium and it came out all red not medium. Waitress blamed it on st. Pats day specials. My daughter ordered a pasta and vegetable dish being vegan with oil on the side. It came all mixed together not on side.  \n\nShort order cook who does all eggs was fantastic! My wie ordered eggs benedict from kitchen rather tan wait in line for cooked to order.  They were just warm. This place needs to do a better job!,0
"Meh, for sure. Since we were staying at the hotel we thought we'd pop over for a drink and light app. What a weird space! Here we are, in the middle of a desert with gorgeous views, land, and sky to see, and this dungeon is what we have available to us.\n\nService was fine. The bartendress was nice. The food selection sucked, and our cheese platter was sub-par. What a waste of space.",0
"2.5 Stars is my rating for this Restaurant.\nWas staying at the resort for a coference and choices of where to eat were limited so I assumed this restaurant would be top noch as it was one of the only restaurant opens on the resort.\nNo so my fellow yelpers, not so.\nThe staff (particularlly the waitress) was amazing! She deserves 5 stars.\nThe food was just okay, felt like I have gotten everything better else where.\nThe salmon was okay, a little over cooked and the buger was just okay. \nI have nothing more constructive to add then JUST OK.",0
"Better to venture off property than have dinner here. It's expensive and our meal was completely forgettable. The kids had burgers which were basic. I had scallops and fettuccine which was uneven. Scallops were cooked to perfection and were really enjoyable. The pasta was seriously undercooked.  The pork shank with fig reduction was overcooked, dry and chewy and way too sweet.",0
"We decided to try this place for restaurant week as they allow you to choose ANY app, entree, and dessert from their menu PLUS a glass of wine for $30. Not a bad deal! \nWe've been to the property before at the Pointe Hilton Tapatio and been to Different Point of View, their other restaurant. This place didn't have the same view but was still very nice inside. It's also built on the side of this mountain so the layout is more vertical with a high bar in the center and table seating below. The decor looks more classic, not hip or trendy, with dark wood, somewhere I expect to see my parents eating.\nWe found the staff very friendly. From the hostess to our server to the food runners, everyone was great. On our servers recommendation we started with the Thai chili calamari and Farmers salad. Both were very good, although the Farmers salad was way too filling for an appetizer. This is more of a lunchtime meal for me as it was topped with avocado and cubes of fontina cheese. I begun to realize nothing would be \""""light\"""" here.\nFor our entrees we ordered the shrimp pasta and the scallops risotto. Both were especially tasty yet loaded with melted butter. The decadence was filling to say the least and I got full quick......but somehow not full enough to pass on dessert. Now how can I be full on regular food but still have room for a whole dessert? Mystery. We ordered the deep dish apple pie with cinnamon ice cream and the chocolate volcano cake. That's right, sweet cinnamon ice cream............melty chocolate cake............excuse me while I daydream...........",1
"Pointe in Tyme's Restaurant Week menu is what brought me in this spring. With the option of choosing any appetizer, entree, dessert AND an accompanying glass of wine--my girlfriends and I couldn't say no. \n\nI started with the mac and cheese. It was a generous size and served alongside grilled wild boar sausage. I chose the Florentine Ravioli for my main course. I really enjoyed this dish, especially the braised short rib and arugula on top. Definitely a good sized meal for one person--I ended up taking mine home for lunch the next day. For dessert I chose the flourless chocolate cake. This was probably my least favorite part of the meal, but that could possibly be because my friends ordered the creme brulee and carrot cake so I instantly had buyers remorse when I ordered my mine. It was a small portion, but packed an incredibly chocolate-y punch. \n\nOur server was friendly and helpful, giving us her personal favorites as recommendations. The ambiance was quiet, and the decor was a little vanilla--but overall a great dining experience.",1
good food / great service,1
Had family dinner here and ha the Rib Eye Steak which was prepared as requested. Generous portion served. Did not feel like having the blue cheese mash potatoes (did not sound like a great combo) that it came with and the waitress substituted it for veggies with no problems. Overall the food experience was very good.\n\nThe ambiance was either retro 80's or they may need a little update.\n\nEntered the main entrance to the resort and could not find any signage for the pointe in tyme but found it after driving around a bit.,1
"I am staying at the Tapatillo Cliffs Resort for the week and took my wife for dinner at the Pointe because we'd eaten here in the past and had decent meals.  In doing this I broke my own rule, which is to avoid hotel restaurants.  \n\nI hate to say it but either the restaurant was having a bad night or has fallen significantly in quality over the past several years.  My beer was warmish, my wife's salad which looked good was missing a key ingredient promised on the menu, my entree (chicken & pasta) was bland at best, the service was poor, and even the dessert wasn't very good!\n\nGiven the number of good reviews, I'm guessing the main chef was off for the day but I'm still going to pass on returning to the restaurant for the rest of the trip.  Of course, in breaking my own rule, I guess I deserved what I got!",0
"We stayed at the Pointe Hotel on a stacation and tried unsuccessfully to get reservations at A Different Point of View, so ended up here.\nWhat a disappointment. I had the Trout and, my mistake, asked for it to be saut\u00e9ed, it was overlooked and tasted of butter. The potatoes and all the other veggies that came with it were so buttered that this was all you could taste. Head Office had the Salmon which she said was fine.\nThe reason we had fish was because there was absolutely nothing on the menu that was Veggie, though our overthetop waiter did offer to make something up from another dish. Overall, a bad experience and I had been there before many years ago and also to the one at the South Mountain point and was not disappointed.",0
"I went here after a late flight from Denver, as it was the only restaurant at our hotel that was really open, and we did not want snacky food. Let's just say the food was definitely lacking. I ordered a burger and it pretty much tasted like a hockey puck it was so burnt. Maybe try it Medium instead of Medium well next time? Scratch that I probably wont be going back next time I am in Phoenix, The service was OK but I have experienced better. I would not recommend this place, but if it is the absolute only place and someone else was paying I would not pass it up.",0
Horrible service! Our waiter took 25 minutes to greet us and the busser apologized 3 times.  The busser was great but you could tell very frustrated.  I tipped the bus boy $20 just to make a point to the waiter and manger that the bus boy needs to replace the waiter.  Steak fries came and were uncooked.  Kathy the manager was very nice as well and could tell I was disappointed in the place.  Spend the extra money and eat at the restaurant up top of the resort.  The only reason we came here was because we were with kids and thought this would be more appropriate.,0
"This place was great! Sad I only have 3 breakfasts to work my way through the menu. I got the \""""eggs bennie\""""- a twist on traditional eggs Benedict with savory bread pudding instead of English muffins...it messed with my head a little bit since I'm used to sweet bread pudding, but I love trying something different and this was definitely unique! My fianc\u00e9 got the chili rellano, which was bomb. Tomorrow I think I'm gonna go red velvet pancakes...\n\nThe service was wonderful- we were seated quickly and had a lovely waitress who gave us giant waters to go so we could brave the Phoenix sun!",1
"Rick is the best bartender in AZ!  Food is delicious and the restaurant has great ambience.  Entry says Breakfast and Brunch, but I recommend dinner...",1
"We came here for their Easter buffet and it was delicious. All the food was good, a rarity for a buffet, usually they're hit or miss. The ham with apple compote was soo good, and their grilled veggies were so flavorful....I'm drooling thinking about it. This place is far for me, but I will be back for another buffet, its worth the trip!",1
"Great service, food and atmosphere! That was until someone walked up to the table and placed a brochure about fat weight loss on our table right in front of us. Not sure if they have this service at the hotel or what.",0
"Pointe in Tyme is so close to having great food but needs to elevate their side dishes and decor just a bit. They have a prime location at the Tapatio Cliff Hotel but they need just a touch of refinement to become one of their premier restaurants. Came in with a group of ten and the service was very good. Server was attentive and thorough. We ordered mac n cheese, calimari, and ahi tuna. Adding crab or lobster to mac n cheese would make more sense than chicken macaroni and cheese as it doesn't seem sufficient as an appetizer for a group. I had the flat iron steak with chimichurri. It was delicious! I would definitely recommend it but potato skins were straight out of a chain restaurant. Again, so close, needs a taste elevation.",1
We went for breakfast and elected to order their buffet breakfast.  This includes fresh fruits . Yogurts . Donuts pastries oatmeal  eggs sausage and bacon . They also include made to order omlet . Their is also a large selection of fruit juices . The selection is always fresh and the waitress were very attentive,1
"*Disclaimer* It has been many many years since I've been here but...\n\nVery romantic.  The restaurant is at the very top of a butte with a stellar view of the city.  The city lights look like a blanket of stars from this vantage point at night.  White glove service.  Continental cuisine.  The food is good, but it is the location and overall setting that makes this place very special.  Take your honey here for Valentines day.  She won't be dissapointed.",1
"I've eaten at this restaurant a couple of times now, and had a really nice experience both times. However, I have to qualify that by stating that both times have been with large (large = ~300 people) groups. And I haven't paid a dime out of my pocket either time. And I was driven back to the hotel on a small bus, with a cold drink in my hand. Which would probably make for a nice experience at just about any restaurant. \n\nThat said, this place is great for private events with a lot of people. Lots of patio space for pre-dinner drinks and appetizers while everyone soaks in the view. Yeah, it can get hot out there, even in the early evening, but if you're fortunate enough to have a breeze blowing, it's not too bad. And after dinner, when the sun is long gone, and you're enjoying a drink with the city lights twinkling before you, it's pretty damn cool (literally and figuratively).\n\nI've had both the filet and fish, and neither has disappointed, although I will say that the prosciutto glazed sablefish I had last time really had no evidence of prosciutto having been involved (which, of course, was the only reason I chose that dish. Prosciutto = bacon = yum). Disappointing. But the fish itself was cooked well and flavorful. The filet is excellent, although they did have some trouble getting the right done-ness out to everyone. No problems with taking it back and getting it right, though.\n\nI think the cost of their regular menu is about  $40-50 per entree, and with that in mind, I'd say this would be a better spot for drinks and a couple of appetizers, or even after dinner drinks. I don't think I'd be too pleased with dropping $150 for dinner and drinks based on the food I've had. Yeah, it was good...but not particularly memorable, and for that amount of money, I'd probably want to go with a Ruth's Chris or Flemings, or a similar high end steakhouse.\n\nBut hey...if the view and ambiance are what you're after, you'll definitely get that here, and plenty of it. Perfect spot for a romantic evening.",1
"My boyfriend and I went here on Valentine's day of 2009, hoping for a romantic dinner. It was anything but. First of all, the drive up there, in a manual, almost gave my boyfriend a heart attack!! The random useless signs that \""""try\"""" to direct you to your destination are more in the way than they are helpful! \n\nAfter we FINALLY get to the top, we are greeted by a couple of very nice, and well dressed young men who politely direct you to the restaurant. This place is absolutely gorgeous. I recommend that everyone eat here at least once. Once we got up, past the lounge area, to the receptionist we of course received a bit of attitude. (happens all the time)\n\nMy boyfriend and I like to eat out a lot, since we haven't the time to cook for ourselves, and since we both are only 19 and look quite young, we tend to run into people who assume that we are the \""""typical\"""" teenagers. You know, rowdy, cheap and obnoxious. Either that or spoiled because of how expensive this place is. \n\nAnyways, after the receptionist barely acknowledged our presence, we were sat in a booth, far from the huge glass windows. I really wish we were closer, but a booth for a romantic dinner is probably the best way to go. Once we got seated, we were addressed by an older man, who definitely did not seem happy with his new table. His introduction was short and sweet. Since the menu was pre fixed, he suggested that we order one of each option so that we may try everything. I can at least thank him for that. \n\nThe biggest issue that I had, really didn't have anything to do with the restaurant. There was a couple sitting next to us in another booth, practically having sex! \n\nBack to the topic, the service after we ordered was very disappointing. We had waaay too many people waiting on us. We had the main server, and 3 food runners/bussers. So we were constantly interrupted. \n\nThe food was delicious though, and the presentation was phenomenal. Definitely have to make a reservation here.  Our bill came out to be about 230, and then a 60 dollar tip, so 290 total.  Be prepared to spend.",1
"We went up here for a party a few weeks ago and wow, what a beautiful place.  The drive up was incredible and the view was just amazing.  The service/food/drinks were great the entire night and what a wonderful night sitting out by the fireplace looking out over the city.  Great place for a Party and I can't wait to go back for a nice little romantic dinner for two.  Maybe I'll be back with 5 stars?",1
"After reading these reviews, I almost felt that 5 stars was too much...then I thought back to dinner and remembered how excellent it was!  First of all, this was on a Saturday night and the restaurant was completely booked up with a wedding on the bottom half and a physician's dinner on top.\n\nThere were 100+ of us on top and the hor'dourves were that they served were excellent!  They even had a vegetarian one for my  wife!  My Favorite was the lobster casadia!\n\nAfter drinks, they escorted us off the terrace and into the restaurant.  \n\nAppitizer:\nCrab Cake w/ lemon juice and some sweet sauce  YUMMMMMMMY!\nI would come back JUST for this!  (After living in Louisville, KY, it's been hard to find good food here in the valley. )\n\nSalad:\nArugula with strawberries, goat cheese and balsamic dressing.\n\nMain Course:\nPERFECTLY cooked steak and sea bass with potatoes.  \n(Now, remember... FULL wedding below and 100+ people on top.. everything came out perfect...even my wife's vegetarian dishes.)\n\nIf you ever go to functions where they feed a LOT of people the same dish, you will find a lot of the time that the vegetarian dishes are usually a LOT better...in this case, it was the opposite!  (only because her food could have used some meat in it :) )",1
"I had great expectations for this restaurant as I have stayed and dined at various Point Resorts and restaurants in the valley and heard nothing but great reviews for Different Point of View. I even liked the cleverness of the name and was looking forward to a nice experience, but unfortunately I was sorely disappointed. While the view and atmosphere were very nice our service there was inexcusably poor. We ended up with a guy named Larry who was extremely inattentive, unfriendly, and all around just unprofessional. When he would finally come around he would walk away literally after two minutes WHILE we were still speaking. He was curt and abrupt in his responses and almost hit me with a knife when he dropped the silverware and did not even excuse himself or apologize. Unfortunately his brusque, rude behavior was not merely limited to our table. However, the hostesses, bussers and other waiters around us were all great, so much so we were tempted to move to another table. Maybe he was having a bad night, but for this type of establishment and for the amount of money you're laying out you would expect half-way decent service. The food was hit and miss. The Kobe short ribs were great- flavorful and tender- the tangyness of the balsamic reduction was a nice foil against the mild sweetness of the perfectly creamy polenta. Consequently, we had great expectations for our entrees- if the service was bad at least our food would be good, but alas to our dismay again we were somewhat disappointed. The central elements of our meals, the steak and halibut, were both flavorless and overdone though the supporting casts of sauces and sides were very flavorful and well prepared. The shrimp with the lemon fennel reduction was fabulous, but it could not mask the dryness and lack of flavor in the halibut. The steak was tough and flavorless and when sent back returned somewhat less tough, but still flavorless. Definitely not at all in the caliber of a Ruth's Chris, JnG, or even Fleming's or the Keg. The creme brulee was nice though nothing outstanding and the chocolate amandine had a flat pre-packaged taste- after a few bites we left the remainder. There are too many other great restaurants in Phoenix with fantastic views and ambience to waste this type of money on poor service and mediocre food.",0
"5 star location and view.\n\n1 star service.\n\n2 star food quality.\n\n1 star atmosphere.\n\nOutside of the outstanding view and patio, I'm having a hard time finding much positive to say about this place.\n\nService sucked. For a restaurant in this price range I'd give it negative 3 stars. Waiter was extremely inattentive. We ended up getting more (& better) service from a different waiter. Not really sure what our waiter was doing all night since we dined late and the restaurant was nearly empty. Our original waiter waited 30 to 45 minutes after we ordered to let us know that the kitchen was out of some items we ordered. This is 100% inexcusable for a restaurant in this price range.\n\nFood flavor ranged from bland to unimpressively odd. The preparation of individual items and dish combinations were overreaching, unappetizing and spectacularly disappointing.\n\nDesserts where completely underwhelming and generic in options and taste.\n\nTo add insult to injury, we were seated right next to a drunk party of 6 (the restaurant was nearly empty) who spent the entire night obnoxiously yelling over each other, constantly using vulgar language.  It was extremely difficult to hear the person directly across the table from me speak. Again, for a restaurant in this price range, this is 100% unacceptable.\n\nI'd be hard pressed to return to this restaurant even if it had TGIFriday's prices.\n\nConsidering the prices, I prefer to give this place negative 2 stars. I'll have to settle for 1.\n\nIf you want to enjoy the view, simply stop by for drinks.\n\nIf you want a great meal and service, save your money for someplace like BLT or Rancho Pinot.",0
"beautiful setting with a great view and great atmosphere. definitely high end and maybe a little overpriced, but it's worth it every now and then, even with the ocassional snooty people around.\n\nwe've been lots of times, and i have never been disappointed by the food. service has been slow on occassion and not always friendly, but never rude or lacking. \n\nthe filet mignon is fantastic! (well, was.. it's been a while since i was here last). the chicken dishes are kind of boring and my mom's had stomach upsets a few times, but she's ridiculously sensitive, and otherwise, this is a really nice place",1
"This is the place to go to grab a drink with out-of-town visitors, hands down.  \n\nThe restaurant is what it is, look to spend over $100 a person and stop at McDonald's on the way home to fill up.  If you have the money, or need a place for a fancy occasion, don't hesitate.  The service was great and the food delicious (at 5-star portions).\n\nThe great thing: you can get domestic bottled beer for $5, and some cocktails (including Bacardi) for $7.  My advice is to head into the bar, grab a drink, and find a spot at a table or couch outside.  You can see the entire valley, and relax by their fire pit/water feature.  Sunset is the best, although I'd recommend a drink before dark and another after.  In all fairness, they could charge you $10 just to come take a peek at their view, and you'd gladly oblige.\n\nIt's a great place to take photos, or maybe somebody you want to marry.  I'll stick to drinks, and you better bet you'll see me outside any time someone comes to visit!",1
"I had been contemplating going to Different Pointe of View for *years*, but because of my continuous status as a poor college student, I've also put it off.  With DPoV participating once again in AZ Restaurant Week, and a dining partner who wanted to take advantage of it, it was finally off to DPoV we went.\n\nBefore we went, I didn't understand the plethora of \""""4 stars\"""" that this fancy restaurant constantly receive.  But having gone, now I totally get it.  It's a great restaurant, but it's lacking that little something to make it stand out.\n\nThe Food:\n-our 3 course prix fixe was delicious, from the lobster bisque topped with crunchy veggie bits to the filet mignon perfectly cooked to the chocolate heaven dessert, my mouth was always satisfied.  However, it lacked that one abso-freaking-lutely amazing dish that deserves a 5 star.\n\nThe Ambience: \n-the view was amazing, and that does deserve the coveted 5 stars :-)\n\nThe Service:\n-hailing from normal restaurants of being served by 20 somethings rushing around, the silent and smooth service performed by pudgy older men was a welcome change, and added much to the atmosphere.  However, they could have coordinated a little better.  Ex: 3 different waiters came to make certain we received dessert forks.... thanks, we did.\n\nSo would I go again?  Definitely, but not until I've exhausted the list of other 4 diamond (AAA  rating) restaurants in the city.",1
"Been here twice now.  The views are absolutely amazing.  Even if you don't want to come for dinner, it has a great patio lounge that you can come to for drinks.  Its not a bar scene, but more of a place to go and get drinks with good friends.  The food has ranged from excellent to good.  I had possibly the best lemon drop martini of my life here.  The seafood dishes are excellent.  I also ordered a brussel sprout salad which was amazing.  The steak was ok.  I've had better.  Would definitely recommend this place for a quiet dinner with good friends.  Try to get a table that faces outward.  Its really all about the view.",1
My boyfriend and I went out on a thursday night for a last valentines day celebration at DPOV. Everything started off nice and were really enjoying the view and each other... The place started getting busier and our team of servers began stopping by less and less... By the time we had gotten our entrees they were pretty much nonexistent. Our food was just above Luke warm and our wine was empty.... After about 30 mins of waiting for some one to come over one of our servers came by to clear our plates. He didn't ask how our food was and didn't offer any dessert menus. We aren't really the complaining type but considering the price of the food my boyfriend got up to discuss our issues with the manager whom removed the entrees. This place really needs to improve their customer service skills. We decided to go to one of our favorite places for dessert. The  Rokerij. We won't return or recommend this place.,0
"I had never heard of this place. I became a member of Open Table and they kept recommending it. I am very glad I decided to make the reservation for The Valenite's Weekend. The menu ran Saturday, Sunday and Monday so that was nice. \n\nThe dinner included 3 courses. A glass of champagne was not included with meal.\n\nWe had a table right next to the floor-to-ceiling windows providing spectacular views of the valley of the sun. If you don't get a window seat, don't worry--the tiered dining room affords great views from every table.\n \nHappy Valentine's Day!!! Make it special...",1
We had the Most Delicious meal on Saturday night. We tried Chef's tasting menu and he certainly did not disappoint. It was a delicious 6 course meal.  We have plans to be back very soon!,1
"The food, the ambiance, the service, it was all amazing.  I think everything was awesome because I was with awesome people.  The view outside is also gorgeous.  \n\nWe were here during restaurant week and had their 3 course meal.  I got the duck ravioli, the filet minon, and the creme brule for dessert.  I sampled their lobster bisque and I wish I had gotten that instead of the duck ravioli.  My filet minon was cooked well done because I am currently pregnant and it was still surprisingly tender.  The creme brule was delightful as well.",1
best food ever,1
"Simply put, this placed sucked. My husband took me there for my birthday and we were really looking forward to it but came away SO disappointed.  First, in a restaurant full of available tables (it was nearly empty), they sat us next to the loudest table in the world.  When I politely asked if they could move us, they happily accommodated us - and moved us one table over from the loudest table in the world.  They knew it was my birthday and said nothing; we sat for 15 minutes, put in drink orders and an appetizer order (we had studied the menu at home and knew what we wanted because we were starving), and we STILL had no menues, and probably would have sat there all night waiting if I hadn't finally asked for some.  We inquired about the 5-course tasting menu, and our waiter admitted he knew nothing about it and said he had to go ask the chef.  No problem, we understand - what we DIDN'T understand was why, when he returned, he still couldn't tell us a stinkin' thing about the 5-course tasting menu - he literally named only 3 or 4 of the ingredients for a few of the courses, and then said \""""Uh, I can't tell you anything more, I know know how anything is prepared.\""""  When I inquired what the \""""salad\"""" was comprised of, he he said \""""some lettuce.\""""  Gee, thanks for the detail.  Finally, the food was really salty!  I'd seriously give this place 0 stars if that were possible. My husband chose this place based on the mostly positive reviews but I guess we are the exception. \n\n  I will, however, say that the view was amazing and it's not as though the people were't kind because they were. But for the $, we'd have been better off just going to Mastro's.",0
"Stunning setting, perhaps the most amazing outdoor setting I've experienced. The food was good, better than we expected as many of these types of places rely more on their setting than quality. The staff was exceptional, the lobster bisques very good. Nice hearty martini!",1
"Amazing restaurant!! I will admit, I was a little skeptical when I looked at the menu. Nothing really jumped out at me, and I thought this might be more of a tourist trap. I was pleasantly surprised by is place! We took our in laws and aunt and uncle to this place after they had driven across country to snow bird. Needless to say, they were ready for a delicious meal. The wait staff was friendly, but a bit slow, hence the 4 instead of 5 stars. My in-laws took their time perusing the wine menu, but we did not receive the dinner menu until after our bottle of wine was presented by the sommelier. He was an interesting gentleman with a great sense of humor. He was definitely the highlight of our evening service wise. \n   Once we ordered, after about 20 minutes after we were seated, the food arrived promptly. First we received the most awesome bread, pesto dip, and goat cheese dip. YUMMY!! Then our appetizers arrived. We ordered pork belly and scallops. The scallops were served with a coleslaw and a citrus-like sauce. Our meals were little pieces of heaven. I ordered the lobster and pancetta wrapped prawns. It was served with a rice cake. OMG the best meal ever. My hubby ordered a filet and it was perfectly cooked. My inlaws had the halibut which was my least favorite of the meals, but still excellent. \n     This place is not cheap, so be prepared to spend a pretty penny.. However, it is really great food and worth every penny!! The view is phenomenal; the city looks serene and calm from high above!",1
"Yet another Fantastic YELP ELITE EVENT....WOHOOO....let me spell it out for you:\n\nF.....for Fabulous Food\nA.....for Awesome Atmosphere\nN....for Nostalgic Nightlife\nT.....for Tantalizing Tidbits\nA....for Awesome Ambience\nS....for Superb Service\nT....for Tempting Treasures\nI.....for Invigorating \nC.....for Complementary Cuisine\n\nYes at A Different Pointe of View Restaurant all of the above can certainly be enjoyed however it's true value is the VIEW of the Valley of the Sun.....it is unmatched. The manager said if we could find a better view in Arizona....please let him know....well I don't know about the Entire state of Arizona....but as for the Valley maybe the view from the Wrigley mansion would come close.....but it can't touch the AWESOME VIEWS you can witness at A Different Pointe of View. Don't take my word for it....just try it for yourself and I think you will see things from a Different Pointe of View as well. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!",1
"Here's the theme of Different Pointe of View- you're there for the view, and you're paying for the view.\n\nEntrees run from $25-$39, and it's completely worth the cost, especially at sunset.\n\nThere is an expansive outdoor terrace if you need to be in the open air to take in the panorama from South Mountain to downtown to Squaw Peak and everything in between. After dark, the valley lights up like stars laid out on the desert floor.\n\nThe menu is American with some French, Latin and Native American influence. Don't pass up the scallops. They're amazing.\n\nHalibut is also a great pick from the entrees. It was cooked perfectly and the portion size was almost enough to have leftovers. \n\nThe wine list is just gratuitous, but you can find some affordable and decent wines by the glass for under $10.\n\nService was attentive without hovering, and due to the dimly lighted atmosphere, the servers sometimes use a small flashlight when serving your courses and explaining what's on your plate.\n\nGreat for a romantic meal, a special occasion, or to bring your out of town guests for drinks and for the view.",1
"We had dinner here last night. We had visited last year but got to the restaurant too late for sunset. We wanted to come specifically for drinks outside than dinner. However, they had the entire cocktail lounge sealed off for one corp event, and the outside dinning sealed off for another corp event. They didn't let us know ( we had reservations) until we arrived. This was extremely disappointing. All they offered were a bunch of \"""" I'm sorries\"""". Very disappointing.",0
"We dined here on Monday, May 21st and took advantage of the Restaurant Week prix fixe offer.  All items on the prix fixe offer are part of their regular menu.\n\nStarted off with an amuse bouche of cucumber and heirloom tomatoes - tasty.  Then, foccacia and another type of nondescript bread with 3 spreads: goat cheese and olive oil emersion, piquillo pepper pesto, and lemon butter - all good.  First course was their signature lobster bisque - smooth, creamy, delicious.  Second course was their risotto of the day (tomato, saffron, chicken sausage and grilled shrimp) for me and the halibut for my husband.  Both were well prepared with fresh ingredients and tasty.  Dessert was their signature vanilla creme brulee with strawberries for me and their espresso cup (chocolate cake with white chocolate marscapone filling, topped with coffee ice cream and a light milk chocolate sauce) for my husband - both were super tasty!  Portions were significant - you won't be leaving hungry.\n\nView was amazing.  Ambiance was cozy, quiet and romantic.  Service was excellent.  I would definitely come back here again and bring visitors.\n\nIf it wasn't so hot outside, I would also dine out on their patio by the fire pit.",1
"There are restaurants you go to for the food. There are restaurants you go to for the crowds. And there are restaurants you go to for the view......Different Pointe of View is the undisputed champ in the latter category. The food is good, about what you'd expect for the price (but that's not why you're here). You're here because those twinkling lights of Phoenix spread out before you both  will whisper sweet nothings to her like nothing YOU could ever think of. Nothing more romantic. So yo, Casanova,  if your love life needs that extra push off the (Tapatio) cliff, bring her here. And thank me later!",1
"For a restaurant that supposedly prides itself on its five star service I was very disappointed. First off the waitress looked completely disheveled, messy hair too small faded black shirt and cheap looking black pants. Then when we placed out order for the mussels we were advised by her that they are very fishy this time of year. My husband had never tried them so we took a chance. We also ordered the Kobe beef sliders and the tomato salad. The Kobe sliders were so well done you could call them burnt, the salad was tiny with wilted lettuce and the mussels(surprisingly) were good. By the time we saw our waitress again we were finished with our meal. I asked her about the Kobe sliders and commented that they are always prepared well done and she quickly brushed off my comment and walked off.So much for the customer is always right. Needless to say my husband and I were very disappointed to spend a hefty amount of money for so-so food and terrible service. Needless to say we will not go to Different Pointe of View again and will NOT recommend it to our family and friends.",0
"I'd love to give this place MORE than 5 stars!!!\n\nIn Phoenix a few weeks ago I needed to planb a nice dinner for a group of 10.  I thought about a few places and wanted to come here because of the view.  (Get it? Different Point of View.....?) Anyway, while I did initially pick DPOV because of the view, I fell in love with the perfect service AND the perfect menu.\n\nThere were great options for my picky group, and not one person left unhappy, or hungry.  In addition, they seem to have a pre-fix menu with a nice price tag if you're ballin on a budget.  \n\nEverything was AMAZING and it's definitely one of my favorite restaurants in DC!",1
"I brought my wife here for our anniversary and we came as a family for my birthday.  Both times it was an enjoyable evening with great views, great service, and great food.  I like to \""""wow\"""" my family from out of town on what a great place the Phoenix/Scottsdale areas are.  This is one of the true bright spots.  I will be coming back again and hopefully for the bar/lounge scene.",1
Had a great meal and a great time here. Wait staff was excellent and the view was wonderful.,1
"Made an Open Table reservation that apparently didn't make it in.  Luckily they had a spot for us on the terrace but I kind of wonder if they just wanted us to appreciate the view..  Good view, but a little annoyed at passing a half empty air conditioned room to get to our table.  The ironic thing is we probably would have chosen to sit outside if given a choice.\n\nThe bread came with a pesto, some kind of dip and a raspberry butter(?).  Nothing outstanding although I did enjoy the pesto.  Maybe if the bread was warmed a bit it would have been better.\n\nThe lobster bisque was very good.  Didn't taste too fishy but had a nice full lobster flavor.  Liked the touch of creamed corn.  \n\nWe both got the halibut as our entree.  It was good, but I wouldn't say outstanding.  None of the parts were awesome and together they were just ok.  Presentation was lovely.. \n\nFor desert I got the upside cake.  The coconut sorbet (?) was good, the cake was passable and the cut fruit didn't add or detract much from the dish.\n\nI was kind of disappointed because the place had such great ratings.  The view was nice and the drive up was exciting.  But the dinner was anticlimatic that climaxed at the bisque.",0
"Tim Robbins was our server!!!\n\nJust kidding, it was really Corey, but the resemblance was pretty amazing. Anyway, I had a fantastic dinner here the other day which started off with a delicious glass of  Seghesio Zinfandel ($12) and an amuse bouche that was some sort of minty-pea gazpacho soup. Both delicious, leaving me excited for the rest of the meal. \n\nFor my appetizer I got their Hydroponic Butter Lettuce Salad ($13) which was super tasty with the caramelized nectarine dressing. I found the the toasted pistachios one of the best parts of the salad as it helped offset the sweetness from the dressing, which was always a yummy experience in my mouth. The bread service came with choices between a foccacia and a mild sourdough to try with their three different spreads consisting of a goat cheese olive oil emulsion, some sort of pepper pesto olive oil, and a spicy butter mixture. The pepper pesto spread was the table favorite.\n\nI ordered the Grilled Cedar River Marinated Hanger Steak ($32) that come atop a scrumptious basil blue cheese risotto mixed with chopped portabella mushrooms and drizzled with a roasted tomato garlic olive oil emulsion. Oh my gosh, so good! I was debating between the Hanger Steak or the Featured Risotto, but get the steak because you get the best of both worlds! My lovely date ordered Pork Tenderloin Noisettes ($26) that wasn't nearly as exciting as my entree, but still good.\n\nDessert time left us trying the Classic Creme Brulee ($9) and Apples on the Rocks ($9). The creme brulee was the typical rich taste, but it came with a buttermilk blue cheese cookie! Oh man, that led to another party in my mouth with the combo of sweet and salty goodness. The Apple dessert came in a lowball glass (get it, \""""on the rocks\"""") which was pretty cute. It came with a scoop of apple spice ice cream and a scoop of vanilla cream ontop of an oatmeal cranberry cookie and drizzled with caramel. It was good, but the blue cheese cookie was really memorable so I recommend getting the brulee for that reason.\n\nThe restaurant is located on the top of North Mountain in North Phoenix with floor-to-ceiling glass windows. This creates a fantastic view overlooking Central Phoenix from wherever you are seated in the restaurant (but if you can, request to be my the window). Also, try and come around sunset because its really neat to see the transition from day to the sparkly lights at night. There is a patio that would be fun to dine at when the weather is cooler. I find the prices to be extremely fair with portions and taste, so don't let that deter you from trying this restaurant.\n\nFive stars for impeccable service by Tim Robbins, aka Corey, quality tasting food, and, of course, the view! I want to come back very soon!",1
"We had our 9 year anniversary dinner at Different Pointe of View, and it was one of the best we've had.  We sat on the patio and had one of the best views in the valley.  Luis was our waiter, and a true professional he was.  Sometime you have an experience that you know will be burned in your memory for a long time... this was one of them.  Thank you Luis and DPOV for making our anniversary such a great one.",1
I simply cannot review this place because it's too amazing.,1
This confirms my opinion that restaurants that claim to have a great view rarely have good food but are always overpriced.  This one is also old and run down.,0
"Not just your average review.  Great story and example of how good the service is...even when your not the diner.\n\nI wanted to do something really nice for two of my friends on Valentine's day.  One problem though, they live in Arizona and I'm in California.  I know! I'll send them to dinner...wait, but where?  I have no knowledge of the restaurant scene in AZ.  So naturally, I jump on Yelp and start looking up restaurants.  Different Pointe of View comes up and it looks like a fantastic choice.  I check with one of my friends (she is in on the surprise) and turns out this is one of their favorite places to eat.  They are both foodies so that told me immediately that the food must be excellent.\n\nSo I found a place, but how do I arrange this so that everything goes smoothly?  Enter Catlyn, the hostess who answered the phone when I first called.  I explain the situation and what I would like to happen.  I was expecting something to the tune of \""""I am sorry sir but we cannot accommodate a request like that,\"""" or something of that nature.  Catlyn responded enthusiastically to this idea and said she would email me the correct form to fill out so that dinner would be taken care of.  She then took my reservation for my two friends and assured me that they would be well taken care of.\n\nWithin hours the form was in my inbox.  I filled it out, preselected a bottle of wine off of the website and faxed it back to the restaurant.  Catlyn responded to each and every email correspondence  I sent her regarding my requests as well as making sure her managers were aware of the situation.  Her enthusiasm and professional manner made me feel at ease with regards to how the evening would unfold.  I knew there was only so much I could do from California so I was reliant upon people I have never met.\n\nI spoke with Catlyn on the phone once again to confirm the reservation and that everything was in place.  She assured me everything was good to go.  I was trusting the staff and the restaurant to come through for me.  A Town Car (not arranged through the restaurant FYI) picked up my two friends on Friday and drove them to Different Pointe of View.\n\nFriday evening came, hours later so did the phone call.  Just hearing how happy and surprised they were on the phone assured me that they had a tremendous dining experience.  They said the food was \""""amazing\"""", the service was \""""incredible\"""" and that they could not have had a better evening at dinner.  Their experience held true to every promise that Catlyn had made, and in turn made me me feel like the trust I placed in the restaurant was more than respected.  The restaurant went above and beyond.  I could not of been more pleased.\n\nI am so thankful to Catlyn and the staff at Different Pointe of View who played a part in my little surprise.  Thank you for helping me bring joy to two special ladies.  The way the evening went made me feel like they were just as important to the staff as they are to me.  Next time I am in Phoenix I will be stopping by to say hello and enjoy the food for myself, because I already know it is excellent.  Bravo DPOV!",1
sweet view and great food and good wine,1
"Dined on Friday, 2/22/13. My wife and I recently moved to the Phoenix area from Chicago and I really had no idea about where to dine. It was my wife's birthday and I wanted to dine at least at a 4 star restaurant- so I came to Yelp for advice.\n\nOur reservation was 8:15pm and we arrived at 7:55pm. We were invited to sit in the lounge area, which we did, and I expected to do so since we were so early.  We sat in the lounge for about 10 mins and were not approached by a server. In fact, I thought there were no servers since I saw none on the floor so I went to the bar and ordered myself, just like I would at a Chicago neighborhood bar. (Irk#1)Drinks were good and strong, but REALLY pricey- $26 for 2 drinks.\n\nAround 8:30pm, we went back to the hostess desk as no one came to get us for our reservation yet, (they said they would find us in the lounge). We were told our table still wasn't ready and to wait by the fireplace. I was a little peeved now and Iwould have expected to wait if I was late- but we were sufficiently on time I thought. \n\nWe were seated after waiting another 5 mins or so. (8:45pm-30 mins late)(Irk#2) The wait staff, I thought, were pretty good overall. They did a lot of table \""""hopping\"""", i.e. covered each other's tables, so diners were well taken care of yet not too pushy or chatty.\n\nWe both ordered the lobster bisque soup. I ordered the halibut and my wife ordered the scallops. Bread was not brought to the table until after we ordered dinner- which was 10 mins after we were seated. (irk #3) The sourdough bread was excellent. The focaccia bread was kind of bland and dry. There were 3 dipping sides offered with the bread, which were very good. \n\nLobster bisque was quite delicious. They put this \""""hydroponically infused\"""" basil seasoning on top of the soup that was very good. I thought the soup was a little overcooked (sitting in the pot too long taste) but still good. My dinner arrived hot and the halibut was bland and little overcooked. (pan-fried). I asked for 2 more pieces of the sourdough bread to eat with my dinner and we were told they were \""""out\"""" of sourdough. (irk#4). Friday night dinner service and out of bread? Really? My wife's scallops were cool as well as her vegetable sides on the plate. (irk #5)The waiter didn't check on us until 10 mins after the dinner was serves (irk#6) so it wasn't feasible to send it back to get reheated. The waiter offered us comp deserts for the trouble, at least.\n\nThe last irk (#7) was that we asked for a bag to put our left-over take home boxes in- 3 total boxes. The waiter said they \""""were out of bags\"""". He checked twice and the 3rd time brought us a Home Depot bag. I asked if he went to his car to get it. How difficult would it have been for the restaurant manager to go down to the gift shop and grab a couple of dozen bags? \n\nMaybe my expectations are too high since I'm from Chicago(?), but when  a restaurant is rated 5 stars by all of you Yelpers, I expect a little better service when dropping a couple of hundred bucks. Other than the view and the ambiance- I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.",0
"One of the best views ever. We sampled a few of the cocktails and the lounge food. The scallops were amazing. We tried two of the salads, the brussel sprout and heirloom tomato and both were original and tasted great. It's pricey, but definitely worth a visit, when you want to splurge a little.",1
"Just ate here during our recent stay.  The reviews on Yelp convinced me that we had to try this place.  The view and the food were awesome.  atmosphere was one of the nicest I have been to in the Phoenix area.  Food was beautifully prepared and the kitchen was sharp enough to split our appetizers between two plates for my wife and I (nice touch).  We ordered the scallops and a salad for appetizers.  We ordered the Filet Mignon and the Venison dishes for entrees, both were excellent.  Place loses a star for the service.  The host and the reservation people were very accommodating, even with a last minute change in plans.  However, our server was slow and not very attentive.  The bus staff was prompt to clean plates and refill drinks, but server was slow with food and extra slow for drinks.  would have likely ordered a couple more drinks, if he had kept them coming at a good pace.  \n\nWould definitely recommend this place for someone looking for a romantic dinner spot in the Phoenix area.",1
"This was not going out to eat, it was a true dining experience! The food was fantastic, the service was outstanding and manager, William Mischke made sure we got the most beautiful view of the city. My girlfriend and I are already planning our next visit. I highly recommend this restaurant. You will not be disappointed.",1
I was a guest at the resort. My girlfriend and I decided to book reservations for this restaurant. We were told our reservations would be at 800pm but when we arrived at 745pm they were changed without warning. After waiting 45 mins the hostess  let us know our table was ready. Then after walking up to the 3rd floor we were told by someone else that it would be another couple minutes. I understand its an experience but waiting 1 hour for a table when you have reservations is absolutely unprofessional especially for a half empty restaurant. When we finally were about to be seated the hostess asked me to take off my hat. I looked around there were people in shorts and T-shirts and I can't wear a hat. Already upset by the poor first impression I walked out before I was seated. The staff I encountered were rude and arrogant. Terrible experience and I will never go back.,0
"I have been to Different Pointe of View with my family for Easter years ago.  Last night was my first time back to the restaurant and could not have been more disappointed.  In walking into the restaurant you are greeted by a very musty, nasty smell.  The upkeep of the interior could use some work.  The view, as always, is beautiful but that is about it.  The food was mediocre but priced at fine dining prices.  Would not go back. Almost forgot, while waiting for our car I noticed the menu posted in a case outside.  The case had a Yelp sticker on it.  How tacky for a fine dining restaurant.",0
"Was very excited to finally come here but left disappointed.  We went on last Saturday night at sunset and can definitely say the view was beautiful. Unfortunately, it ended up not being worth the price.  The service was very slow, although the waiters were friendly and polite.  The blue crab salad was very small (too small for me to call a salad) with about 12 cucumber slices arranged on the plate with a few pinches of crab and bitter greens.  To be honest, I couldn't even taste the crab, only the cucumber and sauce.  Should have been more crab for the price.  \n\nI then tried the shrimp appetizer with Quinoa.  The two shrimp that came were delicious, but only two medium to large sized shrimp for the price was not what I was expecting and the Quinoa sauce/seasoning was not great, with no one at our table caring for the taste - disappointing again.  I do have to say the visual appearance was top notch, but flavor combination and portion size left much to be desired.  Some of the sauce drizzles were very small and none of them were that great.  This is unfortunate, since I know it takes a considerable amount of work to create the sauce reductions, but the flavors just weren't there.\n\nAfter $25.00 of appetizers, I decided to try the lobster with black truffles.  Unfortunately the lobster was luke warm and also dry - not even a little moist.  No butter anywhere (a small cup or drizzle of clarified butter would have changed this dish for the better) and the ravioli that the lobster was placed on top of was also dry outside and inside with no sauce.  The black truffles were nice, but were of course dry as well, making the dinner overall unenjoyable.  Some type of liquid with lobster, ravioli or black truffles really brings out their flavor.  Note to the chef - dry food is just not flavorful or enjoyable, regardless of expensive ingredients.\n\nMy wife also had the same dinner and this is the first time she hasn't finished her lobster.  She also said it was dry , with little flavor and left most of her plate.  My mom and her significant other both ordered the chicken, both took a couple of bites and said the seasoning was awful and left their entire meals - $60.00 worth of food.  They left early since they didn't like the food, were disappointed and didn't want to try dessert.\n\nThere were other people at the table that ate their meals, did enjoy parts of them, but this restaurant appears to be concerned with presentation first and foremost and seems to have little concern for flavor, portion size (doesn't need to be large, just a little more than a pinch of crab when you order crab, a couple extra shrimp when you order shrimp, etc.)  or just the taste of the meal.  I don't think 3 or 4 shrimp is too much to ask when paying this much for a shrimp appetizer.\n\nNo one at our table thoroughly enjoyed their meals, so  $600.00 later, we realized this is a place we can't ever justify coming back to, unless we are invited as guests.  I left frustrated, thinking there are many places that have better food pairings, better tasting sauces and more appropriate portion sizes at two thirds of the price.  People always tell me it is quality over quantity, but this was neither.  The ingredients may have been expensive, i.e. black truffles, but when you have a dry dish, lacking good flavor, what is the point of the truffles.  All in all a lot of money was paid for subpar appetizers, dinners and desserts : (  Bummed.",0
"Great view, but disappointing food and service. \nEverything was overdressed, EXTREMELY salty and lacked a \""""fresh\"""" quality. The service was poor, and our fast-talking server was almost impossible to follow. I asked a question and ended up more confused after his answer.\n\nThe braised artichokes were extremely over-dressed, or over-marinated, and overcooked to the point they were pretty mushy. The salad was salty and overdressed, also mushy. The salad is called an heirloom tomato salad, but the paper thin slices are nearly tasteless (except for the salty dressing sprinkled over). The rest of the salad consisted of some soggy greens, feta bits, chopped olives and some mushy marinated peppers (i think). \n\nIt was fun to try something new, but we won't be returning.",0
"Came here to treat the misses.\nLobster bisque was delicious. I would have a gallon of it.\nMy entree was the chefs special, which was filet mignon and lobster tail, it twas delicious. my wife had the chicken which she did not like.\nthe service was first class and prompt.\nThe View from our table was awesome, you can see the whole valley from up there.\nGood place for a romantic date with your girl.",1
"Gorgeous views, and wonderful food at this relatively expensive special occasion restaurant.  I went here with a group of friends and we began our evening with a drink on the patio.  The bartender was a bit annoyed by our presence.  She immediately asked if we had restaurant reservations, we did and she insisted that we check in at the restaurant first.  We had a good thirty minutes before our reservation, so this really was unnecessary but we complied.  When we were ready to go to our table, she again was miffed when we asked if we could transfer our tab to the table.  We paid the bill first to make her happy and carried our drinks to the table.  There was only one other couple at the bar so this all seemed silly.  \nWe had a very helpful waiter who told us about the summer offerings on the menu that have reduced prices for a three course meal.  The halibut that I had was perfect.",1
"I absolutely love this restaurant! \nWe came with a party of seven and we got a table with a gorgeous view. We had our appetizers and while we were waiting for our entrees our server recommended that we go outside and look at the view.. I didn't know that was a cue and my fianc\u00e9 proposed here! I couldn't be happier! It was a beautiful view, the staff was incredibly nice (our server was AWESOME!) and the food was absolutely delicious! We cannot wait to return for our anniversary!",1
"Our dinner at Different Pointe of View was perfect. We did the chef's tasting menu with the wine pairing and got completely spoiled. The tasting began with a succulent lamb tenderloin, which was a bit unorthodox, but what an excellent way to start! It was cooked a perfect medium rare and garnished with homemade gnocchi, mushrooms, and beet pur\u00e9e. Next was a seared diver scallop with a delicious little side salad, followed by the chef's special that night- Norwegian cod. Before the main event, we were given a lemon sorbet palate cleanser and a \""""bonus\"""" shot of their DELICIOUS lobster bisque- which, by the way, was the best I've ever had! (And apparently took 30 hours to make!) Finally, we were served a melt-in-your-mouth braised short rib. The menu ended with their famous creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and a chocolate turtle ganache. The wine throughout was just as epic- unique red and white grape blends from California and Arizona to compliment the chef's theme for the evening...which the sommelier apparently learns of as the chef goes! The portions and pours were some of the most generous I've experienced with a chef's tasting, and we somehow found it in ourselves to top off the evening with cappuccinos and chocolates before taking in the stunning views. \n\nDid I mention the views? The giant windows open out onto a beautiful view of Phoenix and the surrounding peaks. And the patient staff are eager to usher guests to the balcony for individual photo shoots against the incredible backdrop.\n\nAnd speaking of the staff, everyone was absolutely lovely. From the exceedingly friendly hostess who brought us drinks when we showed up half an hour early, to the gentleman who smiled at us each time he filled our water glasses, the staff was top notch. Our server was a trip- so much fun and so enthusiastic about sharing the entire experience with us. He felt like a friend by the end of the evening...as did our sommelier, who was warm, laid back, and joked with us as he relayed the stories behind all the wines.\n\nI obviously can't praise this place enough.\n\nOh and P.S.- we're going back tonight for a wedding. Muahahahahaha. Round 2 suckaaaaz!",1
"A pretty amazing place to take a date, or business acquaintance. Impressive views from our table and a polite and professional staff. The food was an 8, all around - and everything was prepared / showed well and tasted great. Prices are on the higher side but the overall experience is worth it.",1
"Adam took me to \""""a different point of view\"""" to celebrate my birthday. Super nice. Beautiful view. \n\nWe get there and there are about 3 weddings going on. Enter the lobby and they tell us we can wait for our table in lobby. We see some people with drinks but don't see a bar. So I ask hostess if there is a bar. \""""Not tonight because there is a wedding just go wait in lobby \"""" That's kinda strange we think to ourselves, but  then it gets even weirder. As we are sitting in lobby as older couple sits down next to us and a server came and welcomed them and brought them each a glass of wine. We were completely ignored. \n\nWe were lead to our table (which was not a window view as Adam requested). We notice some waitstaff taking a rug and putting it over something right next to us. At that point we realize that they are using the rug to cover up vomit. \n\nAfter a few minutes we notice there were a lot of high school kids having dinner before prom. One of the tables of them right next to us was so drunk the girl threw up! I immediately get up to tell the hostess I want to be moved and notice a vomit trail all the way to the bathroom. \n\nWe were relocated to a table in the very back of restaurant. Service was slow and inattentive. The guy knew I was gluten free because I had a few questions. Dinner was good. \n\nAfter dinner. Waiter brought by dessert menus. We wanted to order something but he never came back. 10 minutes later he came back over and asked us what we wanted. I replied \""""we would have ordered something 5 minutes ago but now we will just take our check. \"""". \n\nThey knew it was my birthday because Adam had written it on opentable. The guy came back with a birthday dessert and slammed it on the table with zero comments. No candles. Nothing. And it was the most gluten containing dessert option they has. Let me say that the people across from us got candles and a different dessert that I could have eaten. \n\nTook 20 more minutes after this for us to finally get our check. \n\nHorrible experience for such a special occasion.",0
"I would give zero stars if possible. Four mix-ups before we could even make it to the table. Staff was rude, unhelpful and uninformed. We flew in from Detroit and made reservations over a week in advance to ensure a memorable evening. It was memorable, but definitely not a positive one. We will not be back. I recommend going to Top of the Rock instead.",0
"This review is for the Terrace at the Differant Point of View. We got here about 5pm on Friday for a Birthday gathering. We first started out outside on the Terrace but, the wind was blowing like mad and dust and dirt was flying everywhere. \nOur server was good she was attentive and quick with everything until they got busy.\nWhen the rest of our party arrived we moved back outside,that was about 45 min later,and at that time it was not quite as windy.\nWe had eaten while we were inside. Lobster Bisque, which was just OK. It could of been hoter. We also got the muscles,which had no flavor at all. I do not know what they did to them. But I have never had muscles with so little flavor.\nWe also got the Koble beef sliders. They were good, but should of had a better quaility of bun. Good Burger with good topping, just a cheap bun.\nThe view was great up here,we loved that. \nFor such a high dollar place it should of been better food.\nThe hotel was great,they drove us up to the top ,which would of been a horriable drive in my big truck.\nThey will also take you down. Great customer service with that.\nWhile we were on the terrace the service was not so great. But, the experiance as a whole was pretty nice. They did not tell us that the tip was already on the bill though.\nSo I guess that is how they make a little extra.",1
"I reserved my table through Open Table and the staff was helpful and friendly throughout the entire process for a special occasion. \n\nGreat place to dine and killer view. Come early to get the best spot\n\nIts not very costly when compared to a red lobster or any other place. \n\nOverall, great experience and we will come again.",1
"I reserved a table through open table. The reservation was just right. I requested a table with a great view, and we received it. The food was visually stunning and quite tasty. It was a bit expensive. If you are going to have a drink and some wine with dinner, be prepared to spend about $100 a person.",1
"The restaurant lives up to it's name by same, it's a \""""different point of view\"""". I loved being able to look over the city at night and see all the way to downtown. My boyfriend and I had a great table towards the end of the restaurant and had a view of the city and the mountain. The restaurant was offering a \""""summer prix fix\"""" menu that allowed you to get an appetizer, an entry, and a dessert for only $40. We decided to do that but wanted to share an appetizer before. I guess our server didn't understand us, and brought us two appetizers instead and after we explained the error he still charged us. The experience and food was great but I think the servers could be friendlier. At the end of the meal we wanted to get a picture so we went to the floor below the restaurant to take a picture and the two servers acted like it was such a kink in their schedule to take one picture of us. All in all the food, atmosphere, and the company triumphed the bad service and I would recommend this for a date night.",1
"$39.95 for the prix fix dinner which is an appetizer, entree and dessert.  It's such a great deal! And the place is gorgeous for this birthday dinner!\nChose the artichoke/lemon ravioli which was perfection.  My son chose the lobster bisque which he loved.  Next I chose the pork tenderloin with sauces and some type of polenta cake (forgive me for not remembering all the unique toppings), he chose the steak with risotto (again, unique toppings with it) = fantastic melt in your mouth eating.  Dessert for me was a chocolate, sea salt carmel cake and he chose a lemon angel food with sherbert....and with that I could barely get up and walk out of the restaurant.\nBeautiful view of the city as it is so high up, and they sat us inside near the windows for a view.  \nFantastic service with 3 people serving you or cleaning up or wiping tables, etc.\nThis is our new go-to place for special dinners or a wedding when that time comes.  The place is beautiful, unique as it is so high up and the architecture of the building alone is so different and just wonderful overall!\nHave a special dinner coming up?  Try Different Pointe of View, because you cannot go wrong with that choice.  Loved it!",1
"Awesome, Delicious, Yummy...!! No words to explain....!! Excellent Service...!!\nEspecially by Louis. Worthy place to enjoy your anniversary. Scenic view of the Phoenix city...!!",1
"One of the best dinning experiences of my life.  My wife and I recently went to celebrate of 4th wedding anniversary.  We were greeted so warmly when we checked in with the hostess and it seemed every one on the staff was aware of our special day.  Our waiter was very attentive, but never interrupted our conversation.  Needless to say, the views are spectacular and the food was amazing.  There brought us so many different breads and unique dips and sauces to try almost as soon as we were seated.  My dinner had a half dozen different combinations of flavors, different meats and sauces.  The deserts were delicious and it even had a customized \""""Happy Anniversary\"""" chocolate integrated into the design.  It was just an amazing experience and I know we'll be going back.",1
"The view was amazing, the food was not.  We were very disappointed.  Our soup came out cold and we sent it back twice, then just gave up....the waiter seemed more annoyed with us. When our dinner arrived the waiter never came back......my over cooked sea scallops just sat getting old and cold.   The time the waiter came back I wasn't hungry since my friend shared her steak.  It was my surprise birthday dinner......I was surprised all right, since I didn't get to eat anything I ordered!\nWell, I always have next year!",0
Great guys at the pro shop!! I think we bought them out of the new Nike colored golf belts! Thanks so much for the hook up and getting me in and out quick when buying the pink belt for my wedding day!!!,1
Challenging greens with unexpected slopes and fairways with tons of surprises. We played the forward tees but the championship tours looked really challenging!  Love the lunch that you call in at the 8th hole and then eat on your way to the 10th.  Not very much water on the grounds. \n\nOverall we had a great experience and we would definitely play this course again or even bring friends to it.,1
"One of my favorite courses in the Phoenix area. Love the elevation changes on the back 9. Staff is always great. Start of back 9 has a little hut for lunch that you place the order on 8. Usually a little bit of a wait on 10, but with the view you can't get mad...",1
"Love it! Been living near this place for most of the last thirty years, and finally came tonight.\n\nThey had salad, with ranch, or Italian (go figure), or vinegar and oil.\n\nThe pasta choices were;\nspaghetti, with meatballs, and red sauce;\npasta Primavera;\nbow tie pasta, with sausage, and Alfredo sauce\n\nThe meatballs were good portions, , and the red sauce was delicious.\n\nThe Primavera was good, but it's not really my gig.\n\nThe bow tie, with Alfredo, was delicious!\n\nThe bread was soft, with a nice crust.\n\nGlad I finally came, after seeing it for thirty years.\n\nGonna have to come again.",1
"So, I decided to check out this place upon reading AMber W.'s review.  Just as advertised.  Cool dive bar.  Be ready for a diverse taste in music, but i swear, this place has one of the best digital juke boxes I have seen!  I was at G & D last week, and 4 Kings must have 2-3 times as many songs available.\n\nGood prices..  Love when a bartender takes the time to exchange names..  Even if I forgot..  I am bad with names!\n\nAnyways, huge patio out back..  Pool tables, Harley Davidson pinball is fun..  Everyone seemed  nice enough..  No drama from the locals..\n\nStop in, have a cheep beer.  Watch some cash cab on the TV and play some tunes..",1
you go there thinking you will get a good deal but believe me you can do better at Home Depot I bought 3 gas stoves for $349 each plus delivery found better ones at Home Depot for $329 I had already purchased the $349 so it was too late but guess what I'll be at home depot next time.,0
I just had them here to install a new fridge and take away my old fridge they were very nice and the first thing they asked is if we have any dogs or cats so he could shut the door. They came out the next day and gave a call prior to arriving. I would definatly recomend them again.,1
"Last week our old, real washer started making horrible sounds.  My wife called BandB and they came out and assessed the machine.  They said given the age and build quality of the machine it would be best to replace it.  We have had bad luck with new machines so we decided to fix the old one.\n\nAfter a little haggling and some missed phone calls B and B gave us a very good quote on the fix and we moved forward.  The parts were ordered, the tech came out and after he assembled things to get it working he figured out the transmission was bad. \n\nMy wife told them exactly what she wanted out of a new machine and they recommended a Speed Queen.  My wife bought it sight unseen.  It was delivered today;  Water, soap, agitation, just like a washing machine should be.  Read the reviews on Amazon and Consumer Reports from owners, it is a great machine if you are frustrated with Energy Star, HE washers.  \n\nThere was a cosmetic problem with our, but BandB was calling us to tell us that the parts were on order for it by the time my wife noticed.  \n\nIf we are still this happy in a week I will be changing this to 5 stars.\n\n*Update*\n\nStill extremely happy with our new washer.  We bought our machine without even going into the store (I know that sounds crazy but it worked out).",1
"Awful service on so many levels. \n\n1. Initial inspector of my broken range knocked on the door and \""""was waiting around for me for 30 minutes\"""". I was upstairs and heard no knocks. The second he called me I answered and came downstairs. He spent the next fifteen minutes huffing and puffing like a child. \n\n2. After informing me that it would either need to be replaced or repaired, he said he would ask management then schedule the fix. Two weeks later I've heard nothing so I call management who calls them to finally schedule a replacement. \n\n3. The guy shows up today (could've swore we scheduled for the following day (Thursday)) no matter though I was home. He comes in and takes out the old stove, I was in my office working. He yells up that I should sweep where the stove was now if I want to. Thought this was odd and I'm very busy this morning, so I said thanks and kept working. Come down to sign the paper when he's done, and find that there is debris, dirt, and grunge strewn all across my kitchen tile and into the carpeted area. Also, all of the pans/pots that were in the old stove are just placed randomly all over the counter tops. \n\n\nHey B and B: success is in the details, like having the decency to sweep up your own mess and put pots and pans where they were. \n\nSure hope this isn't how they ordinarily conduct their business, if so...it seems a grim road ahead.",0
"Boom, just dropped off my stove that no one on the planet could figure out how to get it to work with propane and not only did it only cost me $70 but they did the work same day!  What else is there to say??  I am so pissed that I spent money to have 2 other people come out and take my money to leave me with a stove that still does not work.  I am such in a good mood that I dont have to get screwed anymore, thank you B&B!  Also if you are looking for used applicances they have a large showroom and even back thier stuff up with a warranty.  I was ready to purchase a stove top from them if they could not fix it but they rocked so I will have to buy something else from them.  I like building a relationship with a quality company and will definitely come back.",1
"Store manager Clinton does not represent Michael Bollig's vision of friendly or professional as stated on the website. Clinton was extremely rude, disrespectful, and accusatory. While arranging the delivery of my dryer we encountered a miscommunication and the coordination of delivering my dryer became complicated. Instead of Clinton taking responsibility for the miscommunication he made every excuse in the book and tried to pass the blame onto me. As I tried to explain the situation he talked over me, raised his voice and was very condescending. I expressed my dissatisfaction with his lack of customer service; however he did not seem to care. On the other hand, the delivery driver was very nice and accommodating. He waited over an hour for me to get home to make up for the miscommunication. I appreciated that greatly and displayed my gratitude with a tip. I was disappointed to notice a ding on my wall from the installation of my dryer after he left. I guarantee Clinton has cost B&B Appliances a lot of money by his lack of customer regard and therefore loss of future business. He could definitely benefit from some coaching regarding customer service and professionalism.

First it was $40.00 to diagnose than changed to $45.00 same story with the cost of repair and part. After they had the microwave for 4 days and still had not looked at it we gave up and decided to pick our microwave up. They couldn't find the microwave, couldn't find the technician, didn't remember where they put the darn thing. I would not recommend these people at all.

"If I could give negative stars I would. I live in a rental property and the property management company has contracted this company to the repairs on appliances in my home. The first time the gentleman came out, he chose not to fix the main problem with one of my appliances. Now they want me to take a second day off of work so that they can come back and fix it. I do not want to waste my vacation on a company that can't fix something the first time. I already used one day why do you get two? I feel is though B&B thinks that since they can get double the service fee for making two visits that's wonderful for their business. What about the consumer?  I am going to try telling my boss tomorrow that I'm going to show up to work within a 4 hour window. I wonder how long he will let me keep my job. The customer service was horrible. The initial service that they provided when they were in my home the first time was horrible. Hence the reason for the need for a second visit. The lack of flexibility and understanding in regards to people's lives was absolutely horrible. I will never use this company and will do my best to ensure that absolutely everywhere I go everyone knows not to use them as well.",0

"Words could not even express how angry I was after I left this place.  My friend and I went there to get pedicures done a couple of weeks back. (I knew if I wrote this review right away, it would have been right down nasty)\n\nFirst off, we are told to sit in the chairs to soak our feet while waiting for a nail tech to assist us.  Jill got her lady first, and I am just sitting there....waiting....getting waterlogged.  Then I realize that this lady is going to do MY feet AFTER Jill's...even though there were other tech's available.  I look over at Jill while I am waiting and she is in pain.  She is not enjoying this one bit.\n\nNow...here we go about my feet.  Now...not to be disgusting, but my feet get dry.  The tech offers to remove the dead skin from my heels and said she will give me the sponge as a gift.  Ummm...thanks!  No word on charging me...but what should I expect?  My massage was very short...and she also hurt my feet while clipping and filing.  She had no TLC in her what's so ever.

"This was my first time at Wendy's, my best friend had been going here forever so I assumed it wouldn't be too bad. \n\nTo start we were instantly greeted and the place looked clean. Unfortunately there was mostly dark colors of polish to choose from which was a huge bummer. My friend got her nails started and I sat next to her waiting for someone to become available to do mine, mind you I was the only one waiting. A few minutes later two ladies walked in and were taken care of before myself when the other technicians were finished, I let it slide. After 20 minutes went by, Wendy (the owner) arrived and started my full set. She was rough and rushed the whole time. Meanwhile another customer came in, she waited, but was obviously impatient. She offered to come back, but Wendy rushed through my nails, which are uneven and have gunk underneath them. She told me to wait aside as she give this lady a fill and polish change. So I waited for her to complete the other lady while I waited to get my polish. She rushed painting the polish, as well as making a mess around my fingers. I'm only content with my nails, and I will not be going back.",0
"After moving back home to Phx from SoCal I have been through about 5 nail salons and have had issues with every single one so, I am thankful to have ended up discovering this salon. I drive a bit further to have my nails done here but I feel it's worth it. The pedis, gels and acrylics have all been up to par with my expectations and the quality is consistent. Although they are not very artistic with their nail designs I can appreciate the consistency. The staff has been very polite as well. The salon is kept clean and tidy.\nCASH ONLY TIPS",1
"This was my \""""secret nail spot\"""" for 2 years.... I went there and received good service.  My pedicure always looked nice and lasted a long time.  The scrub and massage was always decent.  I never had to make an appointment, and I never waited longer than 15 min.\n\nThings started to change.  I noticed that my 15 min wait had become 30 or 40 min.  Last time she made me wait an hour and a half.  I only stayed to see how long it would really be instead of the 15 min she had told me. \n\nThe quality of the service also declined.  My polish stopped lasting as long, and it often looked sloppy.  She would try to charge me ridiculous amounts for the design on my big to that had always been free.\n\nNeedles to say, I have found a place that appreciates my regular business.  I won't be going back to Wendy.",0

"Will never use Wendy's Nails.  I had been going to Wendy's for about two years.  I asked for Shellac nails, a relatively new product because it was not supposed to damage nails.  They assured me it was the real Shellac, but after my nails were ruined ( breaking, peeling), they admitted it was a knock off, and they had never been trained, nor did they have the real product.\n\nI went back for a pedicure. What a horrible experience!  Half way through my pedicure a doctor's wife came in and said that she was in a hurry.  My nail tech (Ann)\nstopped doing my pedicure and started working on her so she could have a mani and pedi at the same time.  Finally she came back and did a very poor job, even forgot to cut and file my right foot.  \n\nI don't think that one's profession or marriage should make any difference in the service one receives at a nail salon.  I am a doctor - I didn't feel it was necessary to let my nail tech know what my profession is so perhaps I would get better service.",0
I usually go to Biagio nails but they were booked so I decided to give Wendy's nails a try. I will never go back. It was night and day between the two places. My nails tech was continually trying to up sell me without telling me the price of anything. I am all about paying extra for a good experience however this was not. I asked for the sugar scrub and calluse remover. After she busted out this weeks newspaper to put under my feet...??? She went and got this cucumber lotion and was making a big deal about how good it smelled. Anyways she gave my my pedicure when I went to pay they said they only accepted cash tips. I ran to walgreens next door to get some cash. When I returned to give the nail tech my tip the man at the front desk told me he needed to charge me $10 on my card. When I asked why my nail tech came over and said it was because I got the calluse remover and the cucumber lotion...I agreed that I got the calluse remover and agreed to pay the as advertised price of $5 more however i explained I asked for the sugar scrub and did not receive that. All she kept talking about was the cucumber lotion. I told\nher I didn't ask for the cucumber lotion she went and got that and I would have been fine with the lotion that was included. Again she never said the cucumber lotion was extra and I didn't receive the sugar scrub like I asked. I felt like she was just trying to get more money out of me and was not being honest. The massage was short and not relaxing. I will never return to Wendy's nails again. Next time I will wait until I can get into Biagio!,0
"Those of us who spend their hard earned money on staying pretty by getting nail services, know that it's important to spend your money at a good quality place. The only good, pleasant nail tech is Don. He is pleasant and does a great job. Everyone else is rude and too fast when they do your nails. \n\nThe owner Wendy is completely rude and treats you like crap. I was sitting in the chair waiting for Don to arrive and she told her staff to ask me to move so people wouldn't think there was a wait.  Then she went on to talk about me and another lady in the shop which made it very awkward. She is a horrible business owner. They rush you out and don't do a good job. \n\nI would suggest to try another nail salon!",0
I honestly wish I could give 0 stars! This place was horrible.\n\nI went in for a fill and they wanted to charge me $25 dollars just for a damn fill!!\nThe owner i'm assuming told me they charge clients more if it takes longer to do their nails! What in the flying F?! I didn't even get my nails painted there. I begrudgingly paid the $25 dollars and went else where to get my nails finished.\n\nI honestly cannot believe this place or the fact they charge such a ridiculous price!\nAny other nail salon i have been to a full set cost 25 or more a a fill is at most 20 dollars including a style!\n\n\nNEVER EVER GO HERE!! You have seriously been warned!,0
"Dr. Alanna is wonderful.  The massage therapists are also excellent. Place is a little outdated, but it doesn't matter at all. So don't judge.  You'll never go anywhere else.  The receptionist is always lovely to interact with as well.",1
"I am really surprised that Salon Surreal has received such positive reviews. I mean, *really* surprised. I went (on these Yelp recommendations) and immediately wanted to call Tabitha for a salon takeover. \n\nI went in for a manicure/pedicure and was able to get in the same day. Parking was a bit of a struggle on a weekday afternoon but not too bad. When I walked in I was greeted by a full wall of products. That's all you see. Just this huge wall of products. \n\nI think Huey Lewis and the News was on the sound system, too. \n\nI went to check in and there were lots of young girls--none of them with fabulous haircuts--standing around the front desk. They checked me in and I waited for my nail tech, who showed up and gave me the weakest handshake ever. I almost laughed and could barely hear her. She was perfectly nice and polite, but it was just awkward. \n\nShe took me back and gave me a class of water, which was nice, and then started on my hands. I didn't have much to say to her (and couldn't hear her over the N'Sync song on the stereo) so I just looked around as she clipped my cuticles. The place is a cluttered mess. I couldn't believe it. There's just stuff everywhere. Photos, pieces of paper, knick-knacks, stacks of towels, old chairs and nail accessories. Clutter clutter clutter. And on top of the clutter was lots of dust. It was gross. \n\nThe decor is this weird early 90s red/black/contemporary thing going on. Oh and did I mention the music? Yeah. I admit that bad music stresses me out--I'm just that kind of person--but this was so bad that if I heard it at a bar or a coffee shop I'd turn around and walk out. And it wasn't even \""""dentist's office\"""" bad. It was worse than what you'd hear at Applebee's. \n\nMy pedicure was better because I could just sit there and let her do her thing and bury my head in a magazine. There were a lot of staff standing around still, too. One had a laptop open.\n\nI suppose the most non-relaxing thing I experienced was the smells. This salon uses Creative nails and the lotions and accessories all reek of fake fruits and flowers. It was nauseating. \n\nWhen I left I went back to use the restroom and passed by the huge washing room and several dozen lockers where I suppose the staff keeps their stuff? It all just screamed \""""factory\"""" to me. The bathroom, too, was this weird mish-mosh of contemporary (not modern) and Tuscan. \n\nThere is nothing soothing about this salon. And as a new client I was shocked they didn't offer me a discount. Instead, I paid $90 after tip for my mani/pedi. And sure enough, my cuticles were ragged and unfinished and after a week my toenail polish is chipping. \n\nOn Newbury Street in Boston I paid $45 for a pedicure that lasted me 3 weeks. If you like the kind of salon that's calm, relaxing, serene, and upscale, this is not your place. If you like fun and action and don't care so much if you have to go back every week because everyone there is so much fun, then this is your place. Personally, I like calm and quiet and quality.",0
"Based on all of the positive reviews I read here on Yelp, I wanted to give Salon Surreal a try. I'm glad I did because I had a positive experience and I will be back.\n\nI called in to try and make an appointment with Bobby because he had the most positive reviews. Unfortunately, we had conflicting schedules for three weeks straight and I couldn't wait that long. I decided to go with Brandy because the receptionist said she was good with bangs. \n\nThe salon itself is pretty cool and really big. There are a ton of stylists and it looks like it caters to medium to upscale clients, but like other people mentioned before, it was very comfortable and unpretentious.\n\nThey have separate areas for cuts, dryers and the sinks, so I got the opportunity to see the entire salon. I was pretty impressed. They have flexible hours, which is great because I work until 4pm, and a huge variety of products.\n\nMy color came out great and even though this is a new salon, the color matched perfectly with my old salon and my cut came out great. Brandy actually did a better job than my old stylist who I had been seeing for almost two years! She was extremely friendly and had great chair talk. She gave me exactly what I asked for and I was comfortable the entire time.\n\nI would definitely recommend this salon  :) I would say it is a TAD overpriced but its not awful, and they fully disclose the prices on the website, on a product card and before your service, so you are well aware.",1
"ETA: Bobby has moved to Moments Salon off Camelback. I'm still seeing him all these years later, and adore the cuts he gives. Love, love him. :)\n\n\n\nI like to give a cut a few days before I pass full judgment...\n\nAND\n\nI AM IN LOVE WITH MY HAIR!!!!!!!!! \n\nI was needing and wanting a change from my other stylist who'd just look at  me and want me to tell her what to do. Um, isn't *she* the professional? I digress...\n\nAnyway, I turned to my Yelpers, and you did good by me. I went to Bobby and am very, very, very happy with my hair. In fact, now several people want his card and to go see him.\n\nHe was the perfect combination of listening to what I want and am willing to do with my hair and making suggestions of what will best suit me.\n\nWell, Yelpers... I've now got a cut that is LITERALLY wash and go. OMG. A girl could not be more pleased! He spent time talking me through how to get my curls to look good (not frizzy and uggh lookin'). He was very easy to talk to and there were no weird, uncomfortable silences, kwim?\n\nI concur with the neck and scalp massage. Ahhhhhhh...\n\nOne thing that really irritates me about some other salons is when they say nasty things about how your hair was cut last time and/or when they make you feel like you are an ugly piece of crap without them. We've all heard it before. \""""Wow, they really cut this uneven last time..blah, blah, blah\"""" Nothing could be further from the reality with Bobby. He was a delight and was very professional.\n\nBoy, I'm glad I booked my next appointment with him NOW. I think he's going to get even more busy with all of these Yelpers lovin' him. \n\nThe man does some good work. I love this hair. In fact, I think this is the first time in the 30-some odd years I've been dealing with this head-o-hair that I truly love and appreciate the fact that I have natural curls. I'll have to upload a new pix with them later. He did a great blow out job on the hair, too.\n\nThanks, Yelpers! I'm a happy, happy girl!\n\n**Disclaimer: I give Bobby -- himself -- 5 stars all the way!! The salon itself was good",1
"I went back for a bang trim because it was really an emergency. I got a same day appt. for 5pm with my regular. I was excited when I walked in because she was waiting for me (I was 15 mins early) and she remembered who I was, which is great customer service.\n\nAs usual, Brandy was very friendly and we discussed plans for the weekend. I also made mention that my hair was NOT black as I wanted, and she told me to just tell the receptionist next time I book a color appt. that I need black and they will special order. ALRIGHT!\n\nFrom the time I left my car to the time I got back in, was a total of 9 minutes.. which was pretty cool. And the trim was free. Cant beat that.",1
"I get my hair cut at Salon Surreal.  I've been going for a while now and I love it.  Each time I go, Lauren, who's at the front desk knows me by name and makes me feel welcome.\n\nBobby cuts my hair and does a great job each time!  He always makes sure that I like when he's done and gives the greatest washes ever!  he also styles it when I leave.  :-)\n\nThe salon is clean and bright and full of color. There are usually cookies and beverages available too.\n\nAside from hair, Salon Surreal also offers nail services, massages, and waxing.\n\nSalon Surreal is great because it's casual and offers great services at decent prices.  Go and treat yourself!  Also, walk ins are welcome.",1
"I'm probably the last person who gives a shit about his haircut but every couple of months it starts to get too hot and I need to get it cut.  Since my \""""lil sis\"""" Francesca works here, I always go to her.  She does a great job and gets me in and out in in 15-20 minutes.  \n\nThe place is always clean, it smells good, and is well lit.  It is really a nice looking salon.  The chairs aren't so close together that you can watch the person next to you.  I really like that aspect.\n\nFrancesca is great & is way fun to hang out with.  All the other people in there are all douchey.  Anyways, if you want some good lookin hair, go see French over here and she'll hook you up.",1
"My experience: \n\nMy sister-in-law, Kari Gibney works at Salon Surreal as an aesthetician (or however you spell it! - She does great facials, waxing, etc.).  \n\nI am starting a new job tomorrow and woke up and decided I desperately needed a new hair-do!!  So, I thought I'd try out her place....even though I  was tempted to try out the nearby Supercuts because I am broke.  \n\nBut, I came to my senses and thought I better not take that chance and go ahead and get a good cut.  So, after reading all the previous reviews and talking with Kari I was so excited to get in (the same day I called) to see the proclaimed Bobby - apparently a hair guru.  \n\nI have to say, it was the best cut I've had in a long time.  I had been going to another salon and paying $40 for the haircut.  It was always just okay.  Bobby's haircut was $45 and SO WORTH that extra $5!!!  He was completely friendly and easy-going.  He gives the best scalp and neck massage too!!!  My previous stylist never did that!!!\n\nThe salon is open and everyone seems very friendly - plus they have ice water, iced tea (in actual glasses instead of styrofoam cups) and cookies.... which my old salon never had/offered.   \n\nMy hair is thin and frustrating to work with because it's also frizzy/kinky/curly.  But, he gave me a new cut (I've always done some version of a bob) that is so cute!!! I love it!!!  And he could blow-dry it so it was smooth looking (without a flat-iron)!\n\nSo, I think I'll stick with Bobby from now on!\nAnd if you need a good aesthetician ask for Kari Gibney!!!\n\nP.S. I do want to point out - as an overall salon it's not the best out there in terms of design/decor/atmosphere - the decor is kind of outdated and it's not as serene as I think salons should be.  But, I gave the place 5-stars because for the moderate price range it's pretty darn good.  I'd challenge you to find a more opulent salon for the same prices.  I'm sure there are some amazingly designed salons out there that are opulent, modern, luxurious, etc - but their haircuts are not gonna be $45!  Just wanted to make that point.",1
"I've always felt like the superficiality of this place makes me feel unwanted, the only reason I go is because of my fantastic stylist, who has since moved to another salon. With that said, I'm glad I don't have to shlep down the 51 to a salon full of self-absorbed people.",0
"Although I have yet to have my hair cut at this salon, I come here just about every 6 weeks to have hair painfully ripped off of my face.  I have tried a lot of different salons around town, and Jessica is by far the loveliest and most friendly aesthetician I have ever had! She nearly makes the waxing experience pleasant :)  Definitely a place I'll be staying loyal to!",1
"Once again Salon Surreal and Heidi Hand comes to the rescue!! I've been so overdue for a hair cut... it's really embarrassing how overdue actually.\n\nLast week I called my favorite girl Heidi to see if she could squeeze me in. Now, every time I go in she urges me to make a followup appointment then and there because she books up so fast, but there are times that I guess I don't list. Hand slap for me; I know. Heidi's so popular because everyone knows how fun and awesome she is, so when I called for an appointment, I knew it was going to be a long shot. Just as I feared, the appointment gal told me that Heidi's next available appointment was in October...October! My split ends screamed and shivered when they heard that. So I asked her to put me on the waiting list and prayed to the hair dresser fairies for a miracle. And guess what?? True to the awesomeness of Salon Surreal and especially Heidi, I got a call a day later informing me of a cancellation for Saturday AM. So, today, I woke up bright and early and had another fabulous hair cut, chatted up a storm with the stellar Heidi and left split-end free. Oh and this time, I made a followup appointment!",1
"I know ... I know... your thinking - this chic lives in Seattle, Wa; why is she reviewing THIS salon? Well let me get my soapbox out from underneath my bed- make sure my mic is on. Haacchummmm... \n\nI have been looking high and low for someone to give me a decent - I was just hoping for decent haircut and color. I have that kind of curly hair that everyone who doesn't have LOVES and everyone who has hates (you know the kind). Jessica Lawson is the only professional that I would ever let touch my hair again. Which in some ways really sucks cause I have to wait for my biyearly business trip to PHX. But she is worth the wait - and weight in gold. \n\nShe gives realistic advice about your hair; sets realistic expectations and delivers above and beyond service and professionalism. \n\nI am happy and honored to have found someone who I trust. \n\nThank you Jessica.",1
"I had been planning for weeks to schedule an appt to get my hair done before my Seattle trip (in two days). But in typical Tina fashion, I realize this past Sunday I need to get my ish in gear and schedule an appt! Slacker, I know. I called a few places yesterday and I was lucky to get an appt at Salon Surreal for today. I showed up about 45 minutes early (got off work early) and had to make do since they couldn't get me in earlier. They offered me something to drink, since I decided to wait, and I was happy to see several piles of my favorite intellectual reads: Glamour and a variety of gossip mags. Hey, sometimes a girl needs mind fluff after a hard day at work! The layout of the salon was a little odd. The lobby chairs all faced the hair products and the partition really seemed to close off the salon. During my wait, I noticed that the staff was really friendly and seemed very efficient. The girl who did my hair, Francesca, grabbed me five minutes before my appt. I thought she did a really nice job on my hair and was really friendly. The total (excl. tip) was $115 for a cut, style, and hair coloring. I wouldn't do this every month, but it seemed pretty reasonable given my curly, thick hair. I had her straighten my hair and it  looks pretty damn great. Just in time for my trip to Seattle....",1
"Consider this a real salon.  A place that you would wear makeup and decent clothes to.  I showed up in my most unflattering work outfit and I was feeling a little more than uncomfortable. \n  \nThankfully, my stylist Mandy didn't prejudge me and was willing to take her time discussing my new cut and highlights.  She had lots of good ideas and I ended up with really good cut and some new blonde highlights.  I'd definitely go back to her.",1
I was looking for a local place to continue my new obsession with gel nails.  A positive review on another site led me to Jillian Vaughan within Salon Surreal Salon & Day Spa.  We went with a dark navy Shellac and gel overlay.  Spring pastel colors be damned-my nails looked neat and super shiny!  She was super quick and the nails had a nice density.  They have grown out well and have not chipped.  Thanks Jillian!,1
"I have been going to Salon Surreal for almost 10 years.  Ann Dellisanti is the best of the best.  I am not always the easiest client to work with, I change it up all the time, and she never loses patience with me. She always wants to make sure I am happy.  I have recommended many friends to her over they years and they always go back too.",1
Great salon- Keiko is my favorite and I know I'm not the only one who thinks so! She is so precise; I always know I will get a good cut from her plus she is so fun to talk to.  I love that they use Bumble and Bumble products from wash to cut to style. I always leave Salon Surreal and Keiko feeling fresh and amazing!,1
they did a fantastic job on my bodywave. I love it-still looking great months later.,1
"I started going to this salon a couple months ago when my hair dresser had moved to New Jersey. I was scheduled with Megan, and couldn't have had a better experience. She was wonderful and friendly and made my hair look awesome! \n\nI was there again this morning and had another great experience with Megan. My hair cut and style was reasonably priced and they don't stress you out with pushing products on you (unless of course you ask for recommendations).\n\nI will def keep going back :)\n\nUpdate: I've been going here for over a year now, and STILL use Megan, and she's STILL fantastic. Definitely recommend using her, although I hear many of the stylists are great (I'm just biased now).",1
"Laura McShane did an excellent job on my hair.  I received highlights, a cut, shampoo, and blowout.  I looked like a different person when I left the salon.  The highlights look amazing and hide my gray hairs.  Also she was sweet to say I did not have that many.  \n\nThank you for a great job and for such pampering and great treatment.  The other salon employees were very friendly and welcoming as well.  \n\nCan't wait to come back.\n\n\n**Quick Update.  I had my hair blow dried straight.  I got it wet this morning and now it is back to its curly self.  The cut is beautiful and the highlights are perfect too.",1
I had some red haired younger girl that had piercings. I told her that I wanted my hair a little bit darker for the fall. She assured me it wouldn't be too drastic at all. I have naturally light blonde hair.\n\nI left the salon with almost black hair. What a waste of $200 and a few hours. \n\nMy hair was also very greasy when I left.\n\nSo I am currently at another salon getting a color correction. Thanks for nothing.,0
"Thanks Yelpers for recommending this place.\nI've used Yelp reviews for ever, but this is my first time reviewing.\nI had my hair done on Saturday at a different salon. Lets just say that I have never hated my hair so much after that. I wanted a nice caramel color, with lots of depths and highlights. Well what I got was a dark mocha with weird almost white highlights.\nAfter doing some research, I found Salon Surreal. At first it sacred me that even though they had many great reviews, most of them were a year old at least.\nI called on Sunday, and I got an appointment for Monday morning.\nThe salon itself is located for in a little strip mall. \nMy appointment was with Bree. Let me tell you what a goddess this woman is!!!!!\nShe is very nice and approachable. I'm so glad my appointment was with her.\nShe not only got my hair as close to the color that I wanted, she did it without damaging it and in less than 2 hours.\nBree took the time to understand what I was going for and explained what she was doing throughout the whole process, she even fix my haircut as the other place had butchered it.\nMy hair is now a nice dark caramel, with an ombre fade into a light caramel color.\nShe even warned me that she was worried my roots would come in darker and that I might not like the color transition. If that happened she recommended that I set up an appointment for a toner. \nThe best part, the price was very reasonable\nI will definitely be coming back, Bree will be my to go girl from now on.",1
"I started seeming Kari a while back. She does my eyebrows and skin treatments. Kari is the best!!!! She is very welcoming and she makes you feel right at home. Explains everything well and makes sure you are satisfied.\n\nThe room where waxing and skin treatments are done is very zen. It is clean and peaceful .\n\nShe offered full waxing services as well as several skin treatments including chemical peel. Many different kinds of customized facials and chemical peels. \n\nPrices are great as well and they run monthly specials as well. Let's just say chemical peel is half price then what it costs me at my dermatologist office.  \n\nThe best at of all of this is that Kari uses PCA skin product. This skin care line is purely amazing and it has been invented locally in Arizona. It is so light weight and it recovered my skin from acnes. PCA also has aging line.\n\nI can't say enough how great PCA skin product is as well as Kari. You will have to check it out yourself and believe me, you will not regret it.",1
"Avoid this place!  \n\nHad gone in for hair color service for the first time (and my last). Should have been a fairly straightforward process. Instead was a mess. Once the color was applied, during the setting time the color was leaking down my neck and face. It went through the cape and hit my clothes and my hands / arms. She didn't seem too concerned about correcting the situation. Furthermore my hair was not even styled properly!  I could have done a better job!!  Coloring is still coming off on my fingers even now. Never had this happen before. Avoid this place.",0
"I have been going to Bree for over a year and every time she does the best job! I just give her an idea of what i want and let her do her magic, love it everytime!",1
"Meg cut my hair and she did a GREAT job.  The best part was that she listened to me, gave me her expert advice and then I ended up with the look I wanted. The haircut and the service are well worth the price!!",1
"Best Funeral Services has helped my family twice now.  Both times they have been considerate of our spiritual and emotional need to provide the best quality care for our loved ones.\n\nThe focus was on taking care of our loved ones and not on which packages we had to buy.  \n\nAs she guided us through the process Julia  R.  was more of a family member than a funeral director.\n\nThe end result was a beautiful, dignified farewell to our loved ones.",1
First of all I never thought I would be writing a review for a funeral home however I lost my sister very sudden. Julia handled everything for me and my family.  She and the staff are the reason why they are named best funeral home.  They blended in with our guest and you could tell they genuinely care and want to help make everything seamless. Julia went as far as giving me her personal cell number and advised me to call anytime. Its rare when I get amazing customer service.  Thank you so much. I cant even thank you enough. If your wanting care and that white glove service then choose this funeral home because they will go that extra mile.,1
Chill &. His crew have taken care of a lot of vehicles for me with never an issue top-notch highly recommend. Trust worthy,1

"I'm going to rant on Walgreens now that I have beaten up CVS. They are switching generic labels without a consult! The one they switched me to does not work for me. \n\nRemember this: Not all generics are created equal! When I complained, they said there was nothing they could do. I politely pointed out the liabilities. What if it was a heart medication they switched that was not as effective? They don't seem to care. \n\nSo, be sure if your medication look differently on refills, you check the manufacturer against the prior manufacturer. Methinks they are saving money at our expense. Or the prescription benefit manager programs aren't riding herd. Whatever, it still screws the pooch consumer.",0
"I shop at Walgreens all the time with my big family! For the most part they are inexpensive. They will match prices on most things and they now have a new program where we earn points so we get money taken off our bill. Since I shop there a lot, I usually get around $5.00 taken off my bill, and I still get the clearence prices as well!",1
"This is the worst, most unorganized pharmacy I have ever felt with. My prescription was simple and found at most every big name pharmacy (CVS, Frys, etc). I was in a rush and had to get to work and I was told I could come pick up my script quickly and easily on my way. I waited over an hour and no one could adequately explain to me why. They were rude, slow, and there was even one pharmacist who continually took breaks to eat some sandwich in the back rather than simply refill my prescription. I was absolutely disgusted with the lack of professionalism displayed here. I forbid anyone to waste their time here at this location.",0
"My son and I have been seeing Dr. Simpson since about 2003...and I must say that this is the BEST relationship I have been in with a healthcare provider in years.  What a terrific OFFICE!  The people there are always kind, especially Pamela who mans that front desk with such incredible skill.  She is savvy with insurance, warm with patients, funny and so very kind!  \n\nI can cite lists and lists of reasons why you should visit this Dentist...\n--My son fell off the jungle gym (or something like that) at school and dislodged a tooth - and Dr. Simpson checked his tooth immediately upon arrival, explaining what had happened and giving us our options.  It was a baby tooth, but my son was pretty shaken up and we wanted to make sure it could stay in his mouth for the balance of it's short life (it did!)\n--My husband (then fiance) hadn't had his teeth cleaned in a while and wanted to have then cleaned and x-ray'd....only to find out he had periodontal disease!  Dr. Simpson was on it immediately and I am told he enjoyed a thorough cleaning with some relaxing gas and tunes from his iPod - reportedly the most comfortable cleaning of his life (seriously?  I think they scraped his teeth down to the roots!)\n--And ME!  I have pretty good teeth but Dr. Simpson reminds me of how to keep them that way, and he's saved me from a couple exposed roots and some tricky plaque deposits!  Whew!\n\nWhat makes this more impressive is that we tried to LEAVE Dr. Simpson when insurance issues made it tough for us to stay...and we tried another dentist and everyone BEGGED me to let them go back to Dr. Simpson.  So..humbly and politely I rescheduled with Pamela who welcomed us with open arms...\n\nDon't bother looking...there isn't another Dentist like this!",1
"Amazing Dentist... Amazing Practice... Period\n\n\nI had neglected my teeth for far too long... Between having extreme anxiety and not having insurance, it had been a while since I had been to the dentist.  I found Dr. Simpson based on searching for a sedation dentist and reading the few reviews online.  \n\nDr. Simpson runs the best practice in town bar none.  His office Manager (If she's not the office manager, she should be), Pamela, is on her game, always on top of scheduling, insurance issues, etc.  A true pro when dealing with all of my na\u00efve questions and showing downright care and compassion for me.\n\nHis dental assistants are super friendly, very thorough, and pleasant to work with.  I never felt judged for having a not so perfect smile and the assistants were full of informative tips on how to better take care of my teeth and gums.  \n\nDr. Simpson, himself, has hands of gold.  My treatments had to be broken up over several visits (not his fault, that's just how bad I let it get) and before every treatment I expected pain, blood, needles, drills, ax murderers... But it never happened.  Every time I have been in to see Dr. Simpson has been a gentle, painless experience.  My mouth has healed and my teeth and gums truly look better than I ever though they would.  \n\nThe sedation can get a little pricy, but I had a panic attack when visiting another dentist for a simple procedure so the extra money is well spent to not have to go through that.  \n\nEVERYBODY SHOULD SEE DR. SIMPSON FOR THEIR ORAL CARE!!!!",1

These folks were called via my home warranty company. Had a bad experience with Sears awhile back and was glad someone else was called.  They worked with me on the time. They came over. The guy was nice. Garage door fixed!  I would be happy to use them again!,1
"I see a theme here.  They completely mess up, then send someone ELSE back to fix the problem.      I was told that I would receive a call before the tech's arrival.  I did not.  When the tech finally arrived, late, I asked him to wait 5 minutes while I finished a phone call.  The Tech was aggressive, & refused to wait.  After I agreed to open the garage door the tech insisted that I move the vehicle there in.  I said that I would.  About a minute later the Tech knocked loudly on my inner garage door.  As I answered the Tech became belligerent & angry when I informed him that I needed 3 more minutes on the phone.  The Tech very rudely informed me that my request for a few minutes was unacceptable.  I asked the Tech to leave.  The tech approached me, I began to shut the garage door, he stopped, turned around & began to pick up his tools stating that I would still be billed.  I told the Tech that there was no way that I would pay for this.  He left.  Good thing I didn't have to shoot him.  My experience on the phone with them wasn't so great either.

"I noticed that they are on here (Yelp) twice:\nI see a theme here.  They completely mess up, then send someone ELSE back to fix the problem.      I was told that I would receive a call before the tech's arrival.  I did not.  When the tech finally arrived, late, I asked him to wait 5 minutes while I finished a phone call.  The Tech was aggressive, & refused to wait.  After I agreed to open the garage door the tech insisted that I move the vehicle there in.  I said that I would.  About a minute later the Tech knocked loudly on my inner garage door.  As I answered the Tech became belligerent & angry when I informed him that I needed 3 more minutes on the phone.  The Tech very rudely informed me that my request for a few minutes was unacceptable.  I asked the Tech to leave.  The tech approached me, I began to shut the garage door, he stopped, turned around & began to pick up his tools stating that I would still be billed.  I told the Tech that there was no way that I would pay for this.  He left.  Good thing I didn't have to shoot him.  My experience on the phone with them wasn't so great either.

Poor customer service.  We have a home warranty.  The chain broke on our garage door and was hanging from the opener.  Called Hung Rite and was told someone would call us this morning between 7:30-8:00.  No call.  We called them and then were told it would be 2 days before they could get here.  Are you kidding me!!,0
"If you're looking for great tacos, tortas and burritos just like the kind you'd find on the streets of Mexico then this is the place.  \n\nThe torta de asada is my favorite.  A Torta is a sandwich made with the meat of your choice.....beans, pickled jalapenos, cheese, tomato, lettuce and buttered bread.  The burritos are also yummy.  In the burrito you get meat, onion and cilantro, the beans and rice come on the side......and the red salsa is so good.\n\nI normally go there for lunch but I'm sure the food is great at any time of the day.",1
"Ambiance - BASIC!  FOOD - Phenomenal!  The amount of Carne Asada in the small and large taco versions was enormous - price was VERY reasonable - the size and quality of the corn quesadillas   (I had the mushroom and added Carne Asada - and tons of the cilantro, onion, lime juice, and some of the red and green salsas all brought to the table in large quantity.  The Horchata was great - light on the sugar - with plenty of taste.  Anna our waitress provided great service and was very patient with a lot of questions - ready to go bk again....",1
Another of Phoenix New Times Ten Best Tacos in Phoenix.\n\nA MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!  Another bare bones establishment that I approached with great expectations. Ordered the recommended Suadero Tacos and they came served in soggy tortillas (unforgiveable to my mind) to begin this less than fabulous experience. Very little taste to the Tacos so I found myself pouring on the hot sauce.\n\nWill NOT return!,0
"This place is unbeatable if you are looking for the BEST street tacos in Phoenix plus amazing quesadillas, tostadas, huaraches and sopas and you aren't concerned with ambiance (the restaurant is comfortable but very basic). Everything is hot, fresh and delicious and they don't skip on the extras. We have eaten there a couple of times recently and, along with our meal, they brought fresh chips and salsa (decious but hot- not for the mild salsa lover), a plate of limes, fresh cilantro, cucumbers and radishes plus another plate with grilled chilis and cactus paddles. Highly recommended!",1
"My husband and I are absolute foodies, and this place is AWESOME!!  The seasoning is amazing!  My favorite thing on the menu is the Tinga Quesadilla, which is like spicy chicken.  It could get a bit crowded in there but its well worth it!",1
"I normally get the steak Carne Asada Taco's and let me tell you they ROCK!!! You get a plate of three tacos with some chips, beans or rice and  with a drink for about $5-6 bucks. Great stomach filler for cheap. And hey pop a few coins into the jukebox while you wait for some interesting looks haha ;)",1
"Pretty blah, really.  \n\nIt's fast food but with sit down prices and barely fast food taste.\n\nThe taco platter Jesse mentioned, is three street tacos on a styrofoam plate which has other little compartments filled with a a few spoonfuls of rice, beans, avocado sauce, and chopped lettuce.  They sprinkle a handful of chips over the top.\n\nThe meat isn't char grilled, but steamed on a flat-top and is greasy/wet enough that the little tortillas break apart before you get halfway through the first one.  I ended up dumping the mix into a pile, tossing the tortillas, and eating it like cereal.  \n\nNot horrible, but also not worth the price.  The combos are $6.75 and drinks are extra ($2). so for $9 you get a pretty weak meal compared with other good/cheap Mexican places or decent sit down joints with service.",0
"The absolute best!!  I love this place and have been coming here for something like 15 years, even when I lived in other states (like MA, and WA and CA).",1
"One Liner: Some of the best Tacos\n\nFood: (scale of 0-4) 3.2\nThis hole in the wall is apparently famous for the green tamales. Personally, I loved the tacos. (pork mexican tacos especially). The salsa was awesome as well. I could never have enough of it. It's good that we had to pay a small amount for it. I wouldn't feel bad ordering seconds after seconds.\n\nExtras: (Scale of 0-1)  0.7\n\nService 0.1:\n \nDecor 0.1: \n\nSpeed 0.1: \n\nDessert 0.2: The flan is really nice.

"I stopped by here on Saturday during the day to scope out the menu. Was 100% empty at 3:30. I sampled (yeah that's right.. i cheated! hardly ever happens) one of their tortillas and was hooked. Small kitchen in the back staffed by some nice Mexican ladies.. Smelled great.. total dive type place. It had success written all over it.\n\nThree of us pull up at 7pm ready to stuff our faces. The parking lot is packed which has to be a good sign. Walk in and are confused. Do we ordered at the window? Sit down and wait? wait to be seated? After about 5 minutes I flag a lady down and ask. She asked if it was take away, I let her know if was to stay she told us to take a seat and she would be with us shortly.\n\nAfter viewing the reviews/pictures the first thing I ordered were the chips and a cheese crisp with guacamole. The chips and salsa and water hit our table right away and the CC zoomed out less than 5 minutes later. Sadly this is where the speediness stopped :(\n\nAnytime we needed something after that point we had to flag someone down and ask.. sometimes twice. Its not that they were lazy its that their were only two of them serving a really busy restaurant. This is no fault of theirs but a fault of management. Staff your establishments accordingly! A Saturday night rush cannot possibly be \""""news\"""" to this place. It was obvious this was the norm.\n\nWith empty drinks/chips we watched and waited as food slowly trickled from the kitchen. 45 minutes and our food finally showed up. It was fresh so we had not been forgotten about. They were THAT busy for the size of the kitchen. Another ding for the restaurant management.\n\nannnyywayys.. I believe I can separate my feelings on management/service/food so onto the food :)\n\nchips hot/mild salsa:\nSuper tasty! The chips had a very pleasant corn flavor, fresh, and far from greasy. On first glance I was sure I was going to hate the regular salsa. I'm one of those weirdo's that likes tomatoes everyway but fresh and it was loaded. I tasted it and prepared for the cringe.. NONE! it was really good. Not sure what they did to remove whatever it is about the fresh tomatoes i hate but they did it. The \""""hot\"""" sauce in the bottle was also very good, standard chili, garlic, Mexican oregano that you find at most places. All three of them were addictive and I was almost happy we never requested a refill.\n\ncheese crisp:\nDelicious Tortilla (check), Super Sexy Cheese Blend (Check), Crispy (Check), Foldability (MASSIVE FAIL). DOH! If you read my review on la pi\u00f1ata you will see me talk about this. This happens when you try and slightly fold and overly crispy cheese crisp to maximize guac/salsa capacity. Snap! you try and recover SNAP! Now your hands are covered with grease and salsa and you have this crazy folded discombobulated mess on your plate(see attached picture.) I have to believe you all know what I'm talking about. Still tasty.\n\nguacamole:\nThey at least have the \""""avocado is the star\"""" aspect of this down but it was lackluster. There are some supporting ingredients that really help bring out the creaminess/fat flavor of the avocado. It lacked citrus, salt, flavor in general. At least it wasn't 3/4 tomato :)\n\nshredded beef taco:\nIt was decent but nothing amazing. They weren't stuffed and then fried which I believe makes a superior taco. Something was overly wet as after two bites it fell victim to taco shell failure. Bottom falls out and you ended up finishing it with a fork. The meat could have definitely used more seasoning.\n\nground beef taco:\nOnly difference here was ground beef and had much more seasoning. Standard large amount of chili powder/cumin.\n\ngreen corn chicken tamale:\nWOW!! The comments about these are dead on. Really good even nekkid. Moist with just the right sweetness and corn flavor. I could have had a plate full of these and probably wanted more.\n\nchile relleno:\nThe pepper was bland, the cheese was a little scarce but at least melted and warm. You can tell the batter was at one point fluffy and light but in a short time ended up a soggy mess. Covered in green sauce.\n\ncheese enchilada:\nAmazing cheese with a small spin of adding onion which I liked the combo. This was covered on red sauce.\n\nSauce:\nRed: Above average, nice fat content and good roasted pepper flavor.\nGreen: No real heat, spice, or even chile flavor. I was disappointed because a few people mentioning how amazing it was.\n\nPros:\nCheese\nTamales\nChips/Salsa\nReasonably Priced\n\nCons:\nHorrible Service: Due to understaffing\nBland: This isn't uncommon for Senoran style but this was excessive.\n\nSummary:\nWhen I have a craving for tamales and delicious tortillas I will be back. Anything else I will likely head elsewhere. If there is something amazing there that I absolutely have to try please let me know! So out of 10 items the group really only liked 2 with a possible 3rd. Maybe it was an off night but I can't give this more then a 2.5 based on our experience. I really wanted to love this place :(",0
"This very good and inexpensive mexican food. They have excellent tamales, the green corn tamales are good plain or with chicken. The shredded beef with green sauce on frybread is superb, as is the frybread dessert with honey and powdered sugar. The one main issue with El Bravo is the consistently spotty service, but the food is consistently top notch if you can put up with the service.",1
"Excellent, fast, inexpensive. Plain old good Mexican Food. I would drive across town for it, but if you live in the vicinity it's a must have.",1
"This place is such a find. Let's start with the chips & salsa because that's really what melts my butter. Perfection! chips were thin, crispy, hot. The salsa was the perfect consistency, not the Hot Ketchup variety & none of that we opened a jar of Pace Picante, hahaha these stupid gringos!  I mean, honestly, my Mexican food standards are not that demanding. Give me the same quality I could make at home without having to drag out my food processor & I'm your best friend. \n\nRice & beans were good, typical, but good. Tortillas are exactly like my grandma's, probably full of lard (sorry if they're not but I don't see this place making the Jenny Craig hitlist anyway). And lard is necessary to build your quality cellulite. That, and butter slathered on the lard laden tortillas; now the clouds have parted. \n\nI ordered the chile relleno plate and the chile relleno was very satisfactory - the batter could be a tad flufflier but, hey, who's measuring. On another visit, I ordered the chicken taco. The chicken was moist & shredded, very good. are the hard shells handmade? I detected a slight comparison to Lawry's but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. I love the shredded lettuce on everything. It's very Baja & makes me feel a little better about the fact that I've completed reversed the effects of 4 hours of Insanity Workout. \n\nThe person who complained about the service should go to Macayo's or Arriba's (excuse me as I hork all over my keyboard). Ok, better now. if you are looking more streamlined, corporate, dining process, these places will be little gems for you. (heheheee)",1
The chips and salsa were pretty tastie.  The guac was pretty bad though and it almost ruined the chimy.  The shredded beef didn't have much flavor to it.  Cant say I'll be going back any time soon.,0
"I should have bought a house in Sunnyslope.  Los Reyes de la Torta and El Bravo in the same neighborhood.  It's like a dream come true.  \n\nEl Bravo has been on my list for a while now, and I finally made it a few weeks ago.  The typical \""""not much to look at from the outside\"""" place, but I found the inside to be, dare I say, charming with it's colorful walls and mural.  Seat yourself and the wait is not long for chips and salsa.  The salsa was mild, but tasted fresh.  The hot sauce in the ever so popular in Arizona squirt bottle was a little hotter with good strong oregano flavor.  Yes, they do charge for chips, but it's a buck.  Nothing to get bent about, and the rest of the menu is priced affordably.\n\nTo maximize my sampling pleasure, I ordered a 3-way burro so that I could try both the red chile and green chile (both made with beef), beans, and tortillas without ordering too much.  Pretty resourceful, I know.  I also ordered the green corn chicken tamale.\n\nThe beans were good, but a little too seasoned for me.  Not overly seasoned, but I'm a minimalist when it comes to beans.  Salt does it for me.  The red chile was made with shredded beef, while the green was made with cubes.  Both were tasty, but I couldn't detect one being hotter than the other, but you know how 3-ways are.  The tortillas were really good!  Maybe a little less \""""floury\"""" than say a Carolina's tortilla.  Now the tamale was perfection.  I'm usually never impressed by a restaurant tamale's masa.  There's either way too much, or it's too tough or too soft, and it never tastes like home-made, maybe because they're restaurant-made.  El Bravo has it down.  I ordered mine without sauce, and it was served out of the husk, so I'm pretty sure they are made with only one husk.  I like the 2 or 3 husk version so you can peel away the layers....mmm, mmm.  \n\nSo, it's too late to make a long story short, but El Bravo is now my new favorite table-service Mexican restaurant for good ole Sonoran fare.",1
My boss and I get green chili burros about once a week because they are amazing.,1
"I use Yelp a lot to find places to eat. My son suggested El Bravo because of reviews. Lots of good reviews.\nMy wife and I  got there and was seated by a very nice lady.  I am going \""""good start\"""". I may of just hit it on an off night. Nothing special about the decoration. Kind of plain could of used some cleaning. Very typical of some of the locally owned places where you can often get some very good food. My son and daughter arrives and it takes a while for someone to come and take our order. We get our drinks and wait and wait. Other people that came in after us have their food and are eating. Our drinks are empty and I have to ask to get refills. Ten min. later our waitress came out and said our food was being made. Ten min later we finally had our food. My son liked the Chimi, my wife and daughter liked their meal. Nothing exceptional, good. I got their cheese crisp Ole, again was good. There was not a lot of people in the restaurant so our long wait was not because they were to busy. I will probably not go back. There are a lot of places that do as well or much better closer to where I live.",0
"I don't know folks. I see a lot of good reviews of this place here on Yelp but my experience at this restaurant was just awful! This is your typical mom and pop place. Normally these types of places are great. Not so with this one. We walked in and were seated promptly. We had a couple of questions about the menu and our food server could not answer any of them. One of the questions was \""""do you have margaritas\""""? She was so clueless she didn't even know if they served margaritas or not!!! Every question we asked she kept having to run into the kitchen to have answered. Finally an older lady had to come out and help her. The older lady told us our food server had only been there a week. You're there a week and don't know what type of drinks you serve among other things? The items we ordered were guacamole cheese crisp, shredded beef burrito enchilada style (red sauce) and machaca burrito with green sauce. The cheese crisp was cold and the tortilla they used had the consistency of pop tarts. Hard, greasy, horrible. It was the worst cheese crisp I've ever had. The shredded beef burrito was only filled about a quarter of the way and the beef was extremely dry and flavorless.  It makes me nauseous thinking about it it was that bad.  The machaca burrito was made using ground beef with spices. Not your typical machaca. We thought we were given an incorrect order but the food server advised us this is how they make their machaca. It is dried then ground. I would not visit here again. I've eaten at better Taco Bells.   Do not eat at this restaurant.",0
Solid 4 star mexican food at very reasonable prices.\n\nthe ladies at the counter are always friendly and help you decide what delicacy will tempt you!\n\nthe food is not too spicy here and always served piping hot!,1
"Wow, El Bravo never disappoints! My first visit to El Bravo was 15+ years ago and I have kept coming back because it seems to get better every time. I developed a high bar for judging Mexican food while growing up in Phoenix -- probably because of El Bravo!\n\nMy favorites are either the traditional combo plates (some variation of tacos + enchiladas + tamales) or the Machaca plate. Great family place!\n\nSpecial shout-out to the tamales: El Bravo makes over 700 dozen tamales around the holidays; they don't make them until ordered, so it's fair to say that demand is *very* high for these delicious fares!\n\nViva El Bravo!",1
"I came here for the reviews, I wanted a tamale for Christmas season, and it was close to the Pointe Hilton hotel we were staying at. \n\nTamales were awesome, that green sauce is excellent with the right amount of heat. On the combo platter I had I felt the crispy beef taco was average, same goes for the rice and beans, but did not detract from the meal. My son had an enchilada in red sauce which was four-star worthy, my wife had a crispy chicken taco that was very good. \n\nAll for a very reasonable price. If this were near our home, I would be eating here often. Thank you El Bravo.",1
Best mexican food!,1
Not impressed. They were busy... I was disappointed in the food. I ordered a shredded beef taco salad and only two bites of meat in the whole salad. Ill try something else if I ever end up there again.,0
"I'm proud to say that this was the first Mexican restaurant my parents ever took me to. I was six months old. \n\nMy love for their food is undying. After every painful breakup, bad test grade and off day, I know I can run to this restaurant and be greeted with warm smiles and delicious food.\n\nIf their extensive menu confuses you, here are my favorite dishes:\nMachaca scramble: amazing. I love breakfast foods and this makes eating breakfast for dinner easy and delicious.\nFlautas: amazing. Especially with a side of beans.\nGreen chile burro: so good.\nAnything with a tortilla is good. Their tortillas are the best.\n\nAnd every meal is finished with free fried, sugar and cinnamon-coated crisps.\n\nMy only dig: Nearly everything is fried. There is no \""""light fare.\"""" But if you're in the mood for an authentic and delicious Mexican meal, look no further than El Bravo.\n\nWord to the wise: You get faster service if you seat yourself in the room immediately to your left after entering the restaurant. If you sit in the first room you enter or the room to your right after you enter, you won't be served as quickly. (Just a little something I noticed.)",1
"Went in on a Tuesday evening. Place was pretty empty but that left plenty of parking so I wasn't deterred. Service was also pretty slow for it being empty. The older woman - owner? - who was waiting on some tables took awhile to get to us, though we were greeted at the door.\nPrices were a little higher than I expected (I was thinking a smaller Manuel's but the prices were a few dollars more than what I typically get there) but my chimi covered in fresh guacamole, sour cream and cheese was delicious. It also had a side of beans covered in cheddar and they were really good. Split a basket of chips with my friend and while the chips were great, I wasn't too keen on the salsa - it was a little more watery and more like pico de gallo than I typically like. I got a water with lemon that was good, it didn't seem like tap. \nOverall, I typical Mexican local restraunt experience. Great food but I'm not sure I'd go out of my way for it.",1
"Have eaten here for years and never been disappointed. Not fancy and the food is fairly basic sonoran style, but have always enjoyed it, found it well prepared and fresh. Service has always been good, maybe a little erratic.  If all or most Arizona Mexican restaurants were anything close to this, I would be one happy guy. Instead we get the execreble Aunt Chiladas or Jordans or the TeePee--the worst.\nBravo.  A great place.",1
"I just can't give them more than two stars, I wasn't impressed by any part of the experience except that they were very friendly.\n\n\""""Sweet\"""" should not be the first word that comes to mind when describing red sauce. I got a smothered chorizo burrito, and you would have never known it was chorizo, no spice or flavor at all. \n\n\""""Peppery\"""", as in too much black pepper, is the word for their hot salsa. The mild salsa just tasted like cilantro. I love cilantro, but with some other flavor too, please.\n\nI will go back to try their green tamales since people rave on here about them, but so far I'm disappointed.",0
"The green corn tamale with green sauce was awesome!  I came in after the lunch crowd so it wasn't really busy, but service was lacking. \n\nIt seemed that \""""regulars\"""" got more attentive service and I had to ask for everything, more water, utensils, clean plate, no one came by to check on the table after I was served until I was finished, etc...\n\nIt would be worth another try and if nothing improves, I'll write it off completely.",0
"I decided to use City Wide because of their lower price.  Well I should have known better.  I was using another company for my pest control but thought I would give it a chance since I was trying to save a little cash.  One night inside my house, I almost stepped on a scorpion and I never had problems with scorpions with the other company.  Two days later, I found yet another scorpion in my house. I called City Wide the next day and told them I found two scorpions in my house.  The customer rep was extremely rude and condescending with me.  She told me I could up my coverage but it would cost a lot more.  Also, they would charge me another $25 fee on top of my monthly charge since they had just been out to my house to spray.  I DO NOT recommend City Wide and would suggest to seek other companies unless you want bugs, critters and scorpions living with you in your house.  Because City Wide was not spraying the right stuff, I'm now behind the eight ball and dealing with a pest issue!!",0
"Bought a house and immediately noticed spider webs and crickets all around. Decided to go with these guys when I received a post-card in the mail for $39 for inside and outside. \nThey gave me the time frame of 2-5pm, which sounded awful to be waiting around for 3 hours. But the technician showed up right at 2pm, I was pleasantly surprised. \nHe explained to me exactly what he was using and what it was for and also helped clarify what I was seeing. \nHe was in and out in about 30minutes or less. Very polite. Received a call a day later to check and see how the service was. Then received a letter in the mail with another deal for the full year. \nOnly down-side is the treatment only lasts about 30days where others last about 60 days. But they do offer a 21 day guarantee-if we see bugs return they will come out again. \nOverall I'm pleased.",1
"My husband used City Wide for pre treatment on building pads so I called them for our home.  We had the best service man for the first couple years, then a different one every time.  I just did not feel comfortable with many of them and I kept calling for resprays.  The last guy they sent out was \"""" mr. know it all\""""  refused to spray for ants in the yard because he knew it did'nt work but had a product he could put on the mounds and we should point them out to him.  We have an acre and have no idea where they all are.  We saw bugs 2 weeks later and are shopping for a new company.",0
"You want to know what's bugging me? I've used this service twice, and while the price is right, both times haven't helped fix the problem. \nI'm glad they offer a re-spray guarantee because you're probably going to need it. Whatever they're doing just isn't effective. I'm willing to pay extra just to get service that actually works and keeps the bugs away. The only way that I even know they were here is that the check was gone.\nAlso, I think it's weird that they don't sweep up the cobwebs like other companies do on service calls. This just seems like a really half assed effort, but they keep calling to schedule service again, and occasionally I give in.\nNo more.",0
"My house has termites (I know, gross) and so I called our regular exterminators (City Wide) for a quote. To do my due diligence and feel good about myself, I also called a second company for a quote. Just as always, City Wide scheduled an appointment (that fit my schedule), arrived on time TO THE MINUTE, and sent a very nice, knowledgeable exterminator.  They then quickly followed up with a very good price. I cannot say any of that about the other company, which just reminds me why I use City wide in the first place.  We have used them for years and I am surprised to see some of the negative reviews. \n\nOur normal exterminator is a young guy named Alan. He is always so friendly, cheerful and oddly enthusiastic. I once suspiciously questioned him about this because I hate bugs more than my kids hate Brussels sprouts, and he shared with me a nostalgic childhood tale about killing ants in his driveway and always knowing in his heart that he was meant to be an exterminator.  I thought it was weird, but also reassuring because someone out there has to kill my bugs.\n\nI am thankful for Alan and for all the bug-killers like him as I look forward to next Saturday when they kill my stupid termites.",1
"My home warranty company assigned them to look into my A/C issues. My experience began with them calling me on Thursday night saying that they would be out on Friday. Someone would call me between 6:30 - 7:30 AM to schedule a block of time for the visit. \n\n8:00 AM Friday morning and I haven't heard from anyone. I called them and they seemed annoyed that I was bothering them with such pesky things as scheduling an A/C repair. Just because it's 115 degrees outside, I have an 18 month old daughter, a pregnant wife and my A/C isn't working doesn't mean I have an emergency. \n\nThey gave me a window from 10 AM - 2 PM. @:20 PM I call the office. Again they seemed bothered by my call. The lady puts me on hold while she calls the repairman.\n\nWhen she comes back on the line she wants me to feel assured that he is still going to make it to my house today. He was in Sun City......I live in Scottsdale. Why did I wait around for 4 hours for them to tell me not to worry he will only be another 2 hours or so?\n\nI can't give you a review on their service because I called another A/C repair company.",0
"My warranty company sent them to my home to replace a valve on my evaporative cooler. A guy shows up and starts working on my AC unit. Claimed there was a clog in the valve. Funny, 'cause the AC was working just fine. I directed him to the evaporative unit and he then said he would be back the next day with the part. I called the next day to find out about what time he would come and I was told they didn't know he was coming back. He did show up, tinkered on the roof a bit, came down and shoved his paper work at me, and I signed. I tried out the unit later in the evening, let it run about 40 min., turned it off and found the problem had not been solved (water continues to run after unit is turned off. Simple valve replacement.) Not only was the evap not fixed, but when I got up the next morning water was running out of the vent in my kitchen! I called and got a very rude Ken on the line who said gruffly, he would have to take care of it himself. It never happened. Ken did show up after I put a stop payment on the check I gave them. He did stop the water from running out of the kitchen vent, but never did fix the evaporative cooler. I had the same conversation with Ken 4 times. I couldn't figure out if it was Ground Hog day or just like two parrots having a conversation. It has been 28 days and I have gotten nowhere with these people. They never initiated a phone call to me, except to find out why the check was returned. Like the previous reviewer, I was surprised at how annoyed they seemed each time I called. Well, Now I am annoyed and I am DONE!!!",0
"Hello, I have a rental home and my home warranty used Lee Collins. They came out to fix it a few times over the summer and then finally said it was not worth fixing and they Home warranty gave me a $500.00 credit towards a new one. I had Lee install a new Trane 3 ton for around $3,500. It never worked correctly and my renter always complained about her high bill and no cold AC. Finally a new tech from another AZ company realized it was installed wrong. The air duct returns. So thats why the bill has been high and no cold AC with brand new unit.

"So, in 2011 I purchased a car battery from AAA which cost at least $150 (from what I remember). I know this sounds ridiculous and makes me appear a little stupid, but at the time I was stranded at QT and had no one (including a boy I was dating who was minutes down the road from my location) who would help. I figured (a) they have a mobile battery replacement service, (b) I'm a member, (c) I'll most definitely get a good deal, (d) I'm a grown ass woman who doesn't need the help of anyone (except AAA - obviously) and (e) what sounds better right now than sitting in my car in this 115 degree weather, while enjoying a nice six pack of Kiltlifter, and waiting for someone to come replace my battery for me on location!?! Anyway, I feel like AAA raped me with what I was charged. To make a long story short (this is getting way out of hand), my battery died again just last week. It hasn't even been two years since it was replaced. Brother came to my work, jumped the car, and we drove it here because it's close to where I live. The guy was SUPER nice and helpful, checked the battery for me, let us hang out in their store while I called AAA (as, again, it was like 110 outside), and even looked into how much they would charge me to replace it if I was not covered by AAA's warranty. I went back in the store while waiting for AAA to see what I would be spending, as I was told over the phone AAA would prorate the cost of my new battery. Maybe he wasn't even that nice, but he just kept helping me - knowing I was waiting for AAA and that I might be wasting his time. Maybe this is what customer service should be like. I'm typically just so disappointed these days that I dread asking for help. I feel like people are either (a) overly friendly/fake in an attempt to sell or (b) super rude and could care less about your business. So, AAA came and replaced my battery for FREE in Autozone's parking lot, as I was still covered under warranty. The moral of this story; however, is that I received awesome customer service here and will return if I need to in the future! Thank you nice Autozone worker guy!",1
Simple need but they were quick and pleasant and right place at the right time.  Good job guys and thanks for your help!,1
"It's a great community. It's on a busy street, so if your loved one is a little \""""confused\"""" at times, just be aware of that. The people who live there are wonderful. The management has a few kinks to work out, but the nurse practitioner, the ladies at All Care services, all wonderful people.\n\nI want to stress here though that the management is terrible. They change hands so frequently that it just becomes ridiculous to expect any kind of consistency or organization. There is a kind of creepy right wing Republican vibe from one manager, who desperately wants to get rid of the \""""freeloaders\"""" (anyone who gets any kind of benefits, which is just insane in an environment like this!) **Yes, I'm looking at YOU Mrs. Crane!** then an easy going, \""""let's see what we can work out for you\"""" the next month. \nIt's extremely unfortunate and I wish it weren't so. Dealing with them is like being stuck inside a yo-yo. If it weren't for this huge liability, this community could be much more successful,  appealing, and desirable. I know it must be a very competitive market in Phoenix for senior care, but I just think this place is the absolute pits when it comes to their business practices. Not a lot of integrity. I can't speak for the entire Holiday organization, as I have heard tremendous things about other locals in other cities/towns, but this one seriously needs some expert advisors to give them a bleepin' clue!",0
"There are good points to this place but the management turn over is less than a year. My mom just discovered bed bugs in her room and another resident said she had them six months ago. Although they called the exterminators right away, the best they could offer my mom was to stay in a vacant room with a cot. And when I picked her up to stay with me for the night, they had no idea how long she needed to be away from her room (one day - one week).\n\nBesides that, my mom loves the food and All Care Services have been very nice and helpful with managing my mom's medications.",0
"You know, bowling alleys are pretty gnarly regardless of the location, but I was SHOCKED at how amazingly clean and, dare I say, classy this joint is (for a bowling alley, natch). Even the bathroom's were sparkly and lacked that tell-tale urine smell that I am seriously over-assaulted with (I think 5% of my reviews have some sort of urine association. It's on attack). \n\nI particularly enjoy watching a grown man say on his walkie-talkie \""""Yeah, we have a ball problem that needs addressing, over.\""""\n\nYes, yes we do have a ball problem.",1
Why can't the attendant understand a simple direct question?\n\nCan someone please tell me just where the Hell I'm supposed to put my freakin' drink?\n\nand worst of all ... my balls don't fit in this place.\n\n*one extra star for the bartender offering me her personal lighter \n*minus the extra star for not having any matches,0
"Best.Bowling.Ever. Well... not by me. I bowled terribly, but I pretty much had the best time ever doing it!\n\n$11.85 for all you can bowl for four hours plus shoes on a Friday night?!? Bargain! $2 beers (Bud Light). I don't drink that piss water but everyone else seemed happy. \n\nKick ass DJ rockin Van Halen, Michael J, Phil Collins and The Temptations!? Chickity Check!\n\nQuite possibly the biggest parking lot in the world. I doubt it has ever been filled up.\n\nThe bartender was slower than the second coming... literally. I must have missed two round of bowling waiting for my drop top. This is the only reason I am giving it four stars and not five.\n\nSO, yeah... I have my own shoes and ball. I'm a geek, nerd, dork, whatever. Unfortunately the sole of one of my shoes broke off in transit so I had to borrow some from the alley. They were pretty dope. I actually considered leaving the one shoe they take in collateral so I could take those awesome bowling shoes home!!\n\nAll I really have left to say is that this is the best bowling alley I have ever been to!",1
"\""""What do you do for recreation?\""""\n\n\""""Oh, the usual. I bowl. Drive around. The occasional acid flashback.\""""\n\nI do not actually like bowling. It's my nature. I only like things that i am good at and I am not even certain I would like to be good at bowling so I had my reservations when being invited to hang with the Optimism Club kids but I love these kids so...\n\n \""""Fuck it, Dude, let's go bowling.\"""" \n\nI do have to admit; I really had a blast here. It is vintage and scummy on the outside which to me is just a bowling alley being honest with itself. It looks so old and dingy from the outside that you are slightly taken aback by the automatic doors. It's a bit like you have never seen one before and wow isn't technology amazing?\n\nI have to say the bar service was a little slow. They rotated between three bartenders and 2/3 of them were ok so I will let it slide. The third on the other hand was probably better suited for my cube-monkey, paper-pushing job. The beers were however $2 for a domestic in a red dixie cup. It reminded me of the days I could get a red dixie cup foe $2 with free refills all night. Ahh college days...\n\nWe were here for cosmic bowling. It was somewhere around $12. I hadn't bowled in probably 5 or 6 years and I am pretty sure I paid twice that then. Great prices. \n\nThe DJ was spinning some pretty excellent tunes (hard drives spin so I can still say \""""spin\"""" right?) My favorite part of the evening went something like this.\n\nMe: \""""This DJ is playing some pretty decent stuff, but I think he has re-played a few songs since we've been here. Kinof lame.\""""\n\nFriend: \""""That's Cedric Ceballos.\""""\n\nMe: \""""What's Cedric Ceballos?\""""\n\nFriend: \""""The DJ.\""""\n\nMe: (Looks closer at DJ) \""""Holy shit the DJ is Cedric fucking Ceballos!\""""\n\nSunset Bowl is pretty damned close to exactly what a bowling alley should be; and remember \""""This is not 'Nam. This is bowling. There are rules.\""""",1
"Best. Bowling Shoes. Ever. \n\nYep. I said it. I'm not taking it back either. I got me some bomb ass bowling shoes that I actually want. Where do they buy these fantastic things? Mine were this awesome almost olive green color with burgundy laces. Fan-flippin-tastic.\n\nThe inside of the bowling alley surprised me and made me smile. The tables were actually exquisite. Yes I also used the word exquisite in regards to bowling alley decor. The bar was gorgeous too. The animations and clips between frames and so forth were a little odd and unexpected but pretty hysterical. I loved the murals on the sides of the lanes that worked perfectly with the cosmic bowling lighting as well as the mural on the back wall near the bar that showed a tale of bowling long ago.\n\nSome of the set up of the alley was awkward, such as the huge tables being out of reach from the bowling area and therefore are probably only used in leagues. The bowling area seating wasn't anywhere near as exquisite and had no place to put your drink but on top of the bowling ball shelf. \n\nThe music was hopping though the transitions between the songs could've been better and some of the songs were repeated. However, the birthday medley that was played in my honor was an amazing mix. The bar was also a little slow but the prices were great. The price for bowling itself was also a bonus. $11 for all you can bowl *and* shoes on a Friday night is pretty stellar. \n\nSunset Bowl also was willing to work with our event in advance and was super fantastic. They make me want to go bowling more often.",1
"One of the last independent bowling centers left in town. Probably the best bowling in town, too. Great bar! \n\nThe pro shop and restaurant are an endless revolving door. If you book a party here, stay all over them. The owner, in particular, is a real scatterbrain.",1
"I'm pretty sure this is now called Let-it-Roll Bowl.  I've been here twice in the last few months and it is a really fun place to have a party. The bowling is cheap as dirt, the drinks are cheap as dirt, and the restaurants food is VERY good. \n\nI was here just last Friday night for a girlfriend's birthday and we had a blast.  It was during cosmic bowling and I think EVERYONE had a great time.  Cedric Ceballos was the DJ (yep, you read that right). He was OK. I've heard better, but for sort of a \""""low rent\"""" part of town, it was wonderful. And very inexpensive.  I will keep visiting as long as they keep their prices right and the atmosphere light.",1
"This has got to be the worst Streets of NY in town. I ordered mozzarella sticks and they not only looked disgusting, but they tasted just as bad. They were either extremely freezer burnt or the breading was not supposed to be on a mozzarella stick. The pizza was jusok but not great. The cheese ravioli with meat sauce looked like it had dog food for meat sauce. I feel sick just thinking about what I just ate. I think they just ruined Streets of NY for me for life, thanks a lot.",0
Bad service. Out of wings... Really? Cold pizza & flat soda. Dirty bathrooms with bugs all over the floors. I sent my food back and didn't eat a thing. Very disappointed and unhappy.,0
"Two stars only because it's the Christmas season and I'm feeling generous. \n\nThese guys are a mess. We ordered by phone and went to pick up.  The unpleasant young woman at the counter had no record of the order.  The guy (equally unpleasant) was taking a steady stream of phone orders and appeared close to meltdown, rolling his eyes at the customers' questions.\n\nWhen he finally got off the phone he came over and just looked at me (it was now 20 minutes of waiting) and I told him what we ordered and the name it was under.  He shook his head and came out with a lukewarm box.  When I reminded him we had ordered a salad, he turned around without a word and grabbed a salad and gave me the total ($32 for a medium and a salad!?!)\n\nI was hungry, tired and frustrated so I paid and got home to find they had not (as we requested) put forks in with the salad (we were at a hotel).\n\nThe pizza  - well, that's what a pizza place is all about, isn't it?\nIt was okay.  Nothing special.  I'd give it a B-.  \n\nI could have ordered from Papa Johns and would have known what we were getting.  And it would be cheaper.  And they would deliver.  And I bet they would have actually been pleasant.  And maybe the pizza would have been hot.\n\nMerry Christmas, Streets of New York. I hope tomorrow goes better for you than today did.",0
"Ordered pizza from here tonight and decided to call after an hour and a half had passed by.  The girl on the phone was rude and said the pizza was already out for delivery (we live 4 minutes away) then proceeded to hang up on us mid-sentence.  We called back ten minutes later after the food had still not arrived and talked to the same girl who proceeded to put us on hold for 3 minutes.  She said she would cancel and refund the order.  I then asked nicely, \""""no apology or anything?\"""" to which she responded saying oh yeah, I'm sorry but it wasn't my fault.  Not sure how the food is, but the service is lackluster.",0
"Placed a order for delivery tonight, I had guest over. I ordered the specialty chicken pizza with the breaded chicken, order of street fries, passion bread, and ordered twenty four honey hot wings. All the food was cold- I live on the same street blocks away. The chicken on the pizza was very dry, passion bread was hard/cold. The Street fries were the worst, rubbery and stale. The twenty four wings I ordered, only came with 11 wings in the box. I was charged for twelve. My order came up to $50.61 and I tipped the driver $5.00\nI was fine with dominoes, but my guest wanted something of better quality. As hungry as we were, Now the food still sits cold on my kitchen counter- minus the eleven wings for my refund in the morning.",0
"I will leave a review about two aspects of this business. First, their waiting room is fantastic, a flat screen, many magazines and a pop a shot basketball hoop. \n\nBut it being a mechanic, the most important is the honesty and transparency. I took my car in for a new battery. I had gone on vacation, left my car out in the blazing sun of the Sky Harbor parking lot and it drained. I jumped it at my house and drove it in the dealer which was about 20 miles away. They told me I needed new belts (which I do) and a new alternator. I know there was no way I could drive my car from the airport and then to this dealer if my alternator was out. I then went to work and ran the most common alternator test to check it and it turned out to be fine. \n\nSo the bottom line, they lied and told me I needed a new alternator ($260 + labor) when I did not.",0
"Honest, trustworthy, professional.\n\nSeveral years ago I worked for a tour company that took all of their vans to Central Car Care to get serviced, so when I saw a groupon for an oil change here I decided to take advantage.  I came away with a good experience and a well running car.  \n\nA few months later I had my brakes changed at a Just Brakes who told me my brakes were going to fail and that I needed to do an extra $350 worth of repair to be safe.  I called Central Car Care, explained the situation, and told them I was nervous about the safety of my car but thought I was getting scammed.\n\nThey told me to bring my car down and they inspected it for free.  They told me my car was safe and didn't need the work that was suggested.  I offered to pay for their time, but they told me to just bring in my car when it needed repairs and my continued business would be thanks enough.\n\nI don't think I've ever been to a mechanic before that said I didn't need suggested work done.  Thank you so much.",1
"I had read all the Yelp reviews and purchased a Groupon for an oil change from Central Car Care. I am very disappointed. The actual experience was great during the service. One of the workers made coffee for me and the lounge area was nice for a car shop. I was advised that my truck needed a water pump, belts, and an alignment which I got done elsewhere due to a better cost. I think they were upset that I turned down the additional service because a week after the oil change I found out that none of my fluids had been topped off, that my battery and alternator were almost dead (no one bothered to check the battery at all during a 16-point inspection), and that my oil change gauge had not been reset.  I would not go back to this shop.",0
"So happy I found this place, great family owners that have been so easy to deal with. I always feel they treat me fair.",1
"Went to central care care for a diagnostic. They gave me a long list of of over priced repairs, so I decided not to go on my weekend outing, for fear of my car breaking down. I took it to a trusted mechanic for a second opinion, that is closed on weekends, where I found out that the so called things that needed to be fixed were inaccurate. One item specifically, was my radiator hose, which the trusted mechanic showed me had a lot of give left it in, not the dry, almost cracking story I was told at Central Car Car. Do yourself a favor and save your money, wait for that M-F shop.",0
"Pricey repairs for air conditioning.  Being the good Union wife that I am, when my mothers a/c went out, I opted for a union company to do the repair.  It was a Friday afternoon, about 2:30, and was told that there would be after hours charge for coming out to repair unit.  Not thrilled, but ok.  Todd was very friendly and did a good job fixing the problem, but the price of the bill was incredible.  We were charged $196 to look up the part number and to pick it up.  I found a coupon to use for $75 off, and still paid $520 for the repair.  When I went home that evening, I found that the a/c at my house had failed as well.  When it rains, it pours.  Turned out to be the same part that my Mom had to have replaced on her unit.  My husband was able to fix our unit for $18.  Too bad he was at work on Friday, and not available to look at the a/c at Mom's.  After talking to several people within the company, we are being refunded the after hours charge of $99.   Unless you're eager to throw away good money on repairs, I'd look into a different company.",0
"I  had a call this morning from Kitty, and they have agreed to refund a good portion of our repair bill.  Thank you so much for the call and concern.  I will now recommend W J Maloney Plumbing as an A-1 company.",1
"Du Nails is a busy little shop in an easily accessible plaza.  The parking is adequate, and the location is good.  It's in the same plaza as Pei Wei, Sauce, and Safeway, so it is easy to run errands while waiting for your appointment... or to get your nails done before picking up carryout.\n\nThe shop has the ambiance of a garage. There is no attempt to decorate or provide comfort.  This is a place to get the job done as fast as possible, so don't expect to come out feeling relaxed or better about anything except being able to check another errand off your list.\n\nThe technicians do an adequate and totally impersonal job at applying and polishing acrylic nails.  They have Spa chairs for pedicures.  Their pedicures are better than the nail services, but the garagelike atmosphere really detracts from the experience.\n\nThe thing that struck me here is that they are geared to provide one kind of service.  They are good at applying a tip and covering it with acrylic.  If you want tips applied for a special event, or are happy with polish instead of a pink and white look, and do not need a lot of atmosphere, i would recommend them. They do not backfill well, and they do not want any client who requires more than their regularly allotted time to do nails.\n\nThe only person in the shop who does sculpts without tips is the owner, Du.... and he seems to prefer not maintaining clients.  I have sculpts instead of tips, and he did not want to do my nails after a couple of weeks because \""""it took too long.\""""  I have 2 friends who tried his shop.  The first time they went to him.  When they returned to have their nails filled, he had another tech do the job and they were less than happy with the work.",0
"Let me preface this review by saying I went there for years, off and on, before Today.  Du himself is a FINE nail tech and does excellent work.\n\nHowever.\n\nI attempted on my last visit to make an appointment for the fill I wanted today.  He said \""""no, you no need appointment, just come in.\""""  I reiterated my desire for an appointment and a second time he refused to make an appointment for me, instead insisting that it'd be fine if I just came in.\n\nSo I (like an idiot) listened to him, and arrived today at 10am.\nHe said \""""30 minute wait.\""""  Grudgingly, I accepted this.\n\nBy the time 50 minutes had passed and 5 clients (who all had appointments, btw) were taken in past me I lost my patience and called him out.\n\n\""""What you want me to do?\"""" was his only reply.\n\nDu, I want you to take ANY APPOINTMENT A CLIENT REQUESTS and NEVER turn down an appointment because that means LOST INCOME.... because sure as the sun shines in Phoenix, I will be taking my business elsewhere from now on.\n\nPS - he says they open at 9am but on 5/28/13 at 9:15 AM when I pulled into the parking lot the lights were OFF and no one was there.  When I mentioned this he pshaw'd me and told me I was wrong.  My check-in at another salon half a mile down the road at 9:20 would suggest not.",0
Got a full set today and they look so bad. So many flaws. The polish is sloppy. They don't look neat and clean.,0
"I have been going to Du Nails for the past 6 months. Tiffany has been my nail technician. During this time I have always set up my appointments in advance. Last month the owner \""""Du\"""" overbooked Tiffany and made me wait 30 minutes. I thought that since it was the first time no problem. 3 weeks ago I came in for my appointment and he had over booked Tiffany again and after waiting 45 minutes I was asked to wait an additional 30 minutes. I could not wait so I rescheduled the appointment. On Saturday, May 10th I had an appointment with Tiffany for 1:00pm. When I arrived at the salon the owner \""""Du\"""" was rude and said, \""""You early, I have you down for 2:00pm\"""".  I showed him my appointment card that had my appointment scheduled for 1:00pm. He had overbooked Tiffany again. Instead of apologizing he told me that he could possible squeeze me in at 1:45pm. I replied no and I left the salon. I will not be returning. I recommend that if you want good service that you choose another salon. They are not running a professional business. I got the distinct impression that they could care less whether or not I was a customer.",0
"I had a pedicure with French tips and it was beautifully!  I am going to have my legs waxed today and my daughter wants her nails painted.  I will keep you posted as to my second experience, however, everyone was very pleasant with me during my first experience and there were several people in the salon that were obviously return customers.",1

Tony and crew lure you in with a $86.50 fee for a diagnostic and then found a horn ring or clock spring issue.  This is a cheap part and 30 min of labor according to the dealer.  We got hit with a charge of $565!  According to the dealer this should have been no more than $250 part and labor.  I recommend having any electrical diagnosed elsewhere as they used to be a great shop but have slid in recent years.  Buyer beware.,0
Not a good experience. At least I got a refund after the issue.,0
"Two visits on consecutive days, two awesome sandwiches and pasta. When asked if they've been here long, shared a laugh at a very well delivered deadpan 42 years. Pictures of family everywhere, clustered italian deli and dry goods, frozen, take home and cook yourself available. Cash register must be from when they opened, very charming. Had their pastrami sandwich, italian hero, very well balanced between the that-morning-baked bread, juicy meats, and refreshing veggies. Oh, and it's CHEAP! A huge sandwich will set you back $3.25-5.55. Also they have freshly made cannolis! This will become a weekly ritual for me and my co-workers, I'm thinking.",1
"I worked about 20 yards away from Tony's for about a year, so I've experienced a lot of what they have to offer.  I am writing this review because I am utterly shocked that anybody would rate this above 1 or 2 stars.  \n\nThey don't bother to turn on the lights in the back of the store most days.  The canned foods in the grocery area are dusty.  I ate here probably half a dozen times, and each time the sandwich had an odd whang to it that I can't identify.  It wasn't *bad* per se, but I quickly learned to spend another 2 dollars for Subway down the street.\n\nI ended up coming here for sodas and candy because it was so close to where I worked, until I caught on that I had to check the expiration date on all the items.  I am sure that the expired sodas and candy bars weren't dangerous, but I sure got a nasty tasing one from time to time.\n\nAlso, the prices randomly change based on who is ringing you up.  \n\nIt's an OK stop if you're hard up for cash and have a hankering for a sandwich with a weird taste, and don't mind rummaging through foodstuffs to find fresh items.  But certainly never go out of your way to eat here.",0
"This place has to be the worst and dirtiest place in town. I have driven by this place my whole life and today I said they have to be doing something right over there cause they have been here for 40 years . How they have been in business this long is beyond me. I'm Italian and I'm embarrassed for these people. This is the worst sandwich, pasta, salad, macaroni salad, and pizza. I'm so mad they have $16 of my money. I wish I would have lost that money so at least I could be happy for making the day of who ever was to find it. But instead I feel ripped off. F$%#ing disgusting, the health department needs to go in here and shut them down. What a disgrace to Italian food. They have a lot of groceries that look interesting but this place is so dirty and cluttered that I don't think they have sold anything off these shelves since opening day 40 years ago.",0
"When my friend had took me here to eat lunch, I fell in love with subsandwich. I love it",1
"Aside for the enthusiasm that the owner has for the store that place was complete crap. \nI ordered spaghetti and meatballs with garlic bread and salad. the salad was bag greens and 3 cherry tomatoes with a little tiny packet of ranch.\nThe spaghetti was overcooked in a half inch of water, the sauce had no flavor once so ever, and it came with one, smaller than a cue ball, meatball, almost flavorless meatball. more like a mush ball\nThe garlic bread was awesome\n\nI also purchased a small jar of pesto recommended by the owner. I opened it just to put on my pasta because it had no flavor. I don't even think I'm going to eat the pesto as it wasn't that good either. \nThere was what appears to be a homeless man rubbing through the trash looking for food. He was more than happy to eat my leftovers that I was unhappy with. \n\nPerhaps next time I should get a sub.\n\nThe pesto was tossed out after the weekend...99 percent full.",0
Italian hero was decent but probably wouldn't come back for it.  The pasta salad was old and some of the pasta was starting to get hard.  No bueno.  Overall I'd say they are coming up short in too many levels. If you want a real Italian deli go to Niccolis not too far from here.  They have one of the best sandwiches I've ever had!,0

"I went in to buy two different hiking boots for different types of hikes coming up this month. I walked in and was greeted as I walked back to the boots area. There was already someone being service and I looked around waiting my turn. After about 30 mins I walked out.

Instead I walked around in the small area, surely making the other customer upset.\n\nI understand the limited staff to maximize profit, but they have to have a way to let a customer wander around the store, while still being \""""in line\"""" to purchase boots.

"AZ Hiking Shack did not adequately stand behind their product, in my view.  \n   I bought a backpack at the AZ Hiking shack and the pack messed with my back really badly, causing me to have to go to a physical therapist, it seems, for months of therapy. Early on in this re-healing, I went to take the pack back to get a refund. They would not stand behind the product and give me a full refund. \n   The pack was in great shape. I had cleaned it by using a dry terry cloth to take off a little dust, and visually, I could not tell it had been used. I brought all the tag material that came with the pack too. I had spent $269.00 plus tax for the pack and all they would give me is $100.00. I could not believe this! I appealed to the owner and he upped it to $125.00. I told him this was outrageous, that REI or Summit Hut would stand behind their products, and that I would have expected them to also. \n\n   I would never shop there again, with this poor service.",0
"Yeah!  I just love this place.  They are very friendly and helpful and they make you feel welcome as you look for a simple hiking book or way more complicated specialist gear.  I thought their selection was very good and perfect for real backcountry work.  They had some very cool solar lamps and other overnight camping things, as well as a good selection of rock hounding books and tools.  Some excellent picks, for example.\n\nI am not a fan of REI or of any big corporation and so on that alone, I am grateful that this sweet little company is still with us from the 1970's.  The wonderful, idealistic 70's.\n\nThank you guys, glad you are still here !",1
Very friendly staff but not the best selection of gear and the price aren't the best. There are  better stores.,0
"These guys are awesome! Super educated on product! They are eager to help and when I was leaving... they actual said, \""""thanks for coming in, we appreciate your business\"""". \n\nWow! How many businesses will say that to a customer!  Their inventory might not be as large in all product categories but they are happy to order what you need.\n\nHowever, when it comes to Rock climbing gear... NO ONE will have a larger selection... it's awesome! \n\nI can't say enough about the quality of the staff... The best!",1
"Amazing this place stays in business given the owner's lack of customer service. I went in today looking for an Imlay Canyonero rope. After waiting around ~10 minutes the owner came to help me. He showed me an Imlay rope and I said \""""that's a Canyonfire\"""" to which he replied \""""I have no idea.\"""" Then he started telling me about the differences between nylon and polyester rope and that the Canyonero is not a good rope for getting wet. I said I need the Canyonero it's the rope I want and it was designed to get wet. He left, returned and pointed at a rope and said \""""that's an Imlay rope.\"""" I said \""""is it the Canyonero\"""" to which he replied he would have to go and look through the catalogs to determine whether it is a Canyonero rope. It was clear he didn't want to go though this effort so I said \""""well, I guess you're not intested in selling rope\"""" and he replied \""""I sells pallets of rope.\"""" Well here's 200 ft of pallet plus a $70 rope bag he won't be selling today. He also won't be getting any of the around $1000 a year that I spend on outdoor gear. For future reference, the owner might consider labelling the ropes in his store if he knows nothing about them.",0
"Thank goodness for Valley Self Storage.  I have tons of stuff crammed into lockers at their facility.  The place is cooled, so your heat sensitive things aren't completely destroyed.  I have never seen a spider or any kind of bug for that matter.  I'm sure they do regular pest control which is huge.... no one wants to open a box and find something that bites or stings has crawled in and made it home.  They are extremely nice.  If you are late, or something happens to your automatic payment (happened to me) they call and make sure you are aware.  I was very happy that they did.  It would have been upsetting if they just assumed I was flaking on my contract and sold my stuff like I have heard that other storage places have done.\n\nI've been a customer there for about 6 years.  I'm very happy with them.",1
Clean and climate controlled. I have had a unit here for 10 years and they have never raised the rate. Nice owners as well.,1
I went there this weekend to compare quality and price to moon valley nursery-I am not impressed at all first off they said they wouldn't price match second of all there trees were at best sub par-so i went to moon valley nursery in avondale and got a ton of trees for the price of just a couple of trees at Whitfill trees plus the Whitfill nursery warranty isn't good. I would definitely recommend going to Moon Valley if you need trees,0
"There is a really large selection of different plants and trees. Half of them aren't labeled or priced. So unless you know exactly what you're looking for you may need to grab a worker... if you can find one. Aside from the cashier the only worker I saw was in the parking lot. I enjoyed walking around and looking at the wide variety of plants but I couldn't help but notice that every nook and cranny was stuffed with random crap. Every turn had revealed more gardening tools and materials, it looked junkie. I went to Whitfill for flowers which I usually buy at Home Depot but I wanted nursery quality, if there is such a thing. The same flowers were 4 times the price than Home Depot. I decided I wasn't willing to pay nursery prices and left empty handed.",0
"WARNING do not go here!!!! I bought $150.00 dollars of plants here about 2 weeks ago and one of the plants had a pod on it that I didn't see and it opened and now the plant is infested with bugs. I put this plant and some pansies i bought there in my atrium where I have no other plants and now I have bugs everywhere. \nWhen I called the nursery and told them what happened they said oh well! All the other nurseries guarantee their plants this place sells you diseased plants on purpose knowing you will be stuck with them. I used to go there all the time, I will never go back!!!!! Beware!!!!!",0
"Whitfill lacks customer service!  I've been there twice, never have been greeted or asked if I needed help. \n\nI walked around for 45 minutes looking for an Arizona Rosewood. Finally asked a  worker who was arranging plants - he didn't know.\n\nSure they have a lot of stuff and attractively presented in front, but don't expect any service. Home Depot does it a lot better.",0
"I went in to Whitfield last week (May 11, 2013) looking for plants for my yard.  No one greeted me so I had to track down someone for help.  I found a woman watering and asked her for help.  She asked this other employee to help me.  He agreed since he just ended a call helping a customer.  He asked the woman watering if they had any Zucchini plants she said she did not know she would have to go check.  He said that was not necessary because he simply told the customer they did indeed have them.  I thought to myself that would really make me angry if I drove all the way there for something they said they had come to find out after arriving they did not have it.  The employee took me to look at a plant I was asking about and while he was in the middle of explaining about the plant, his phone rang and he proceeded to answer a personal call only to yell at the other person on the phone about being responsible and being locked out of the house etc...He said he could not talk, said he was at work and hung up on the caller.  I thought to myself, wow how rude.  He then made another call to another person saying they needed to communicate and that they had to go back home to let the other person back in the home.\n\nI simply just walked out at that point.   I don't purchase items from any retail establishment that does not display good customer service.",0
": I really wish there were a nursery that could compete w/ their tree selection.  It became apparent after they planted our three fruit trees a few months ago that they'd injured the apple tree w/ a giant pole they drove through the roots (to keep the trunk straight, they said, unlike the apple tree we'd purchased there the previous year and planted ourselves.  Irony?  We'd chosen that apple, and it was curved when we bought it.  Furthermore, they were only supposed to plant the other two trees.  If we'd have planted the new apple, as planned, it wouldn't be struggling to survive, right now).\n\nMore than anything, the experience reminds me to be assertive and complain about terrible service, and to look elsewhere before buying any more trees from these people.\n\n(Edit:  Apple tree died.)",0
"Best Christmas tree selection and the guys helping are so helpful and nice. They give a fresh cut and assist to the vehicle. Janis, the owner is really sweet and supports the community charities. Thanks!",1
"This review is specifically for their (supposed) landscape planning service.  Whitfill claims to do free landscape planning, but apparently not! The owner, Bryan, came to our house, a new build, in early September to look at the backyard and discuss what we'd like to do with the expanse of dirt.  Per his request, I sent him a plot plan (mid-September).  I followed up weekly with phone calls, in which he kept saying that he was out of town and would do the plan as soon as he got back, or he was just about to start the plan.  It became pretty clear he had no intention of doing a plan, even after I pointed out that we couldn't start buying plants until we knew what we were doing.  But I kept calling every week just to see if he'd ever admit that he wasn't going to do the plan.  Two months later:  no plan.  Buh bye, Whitfill.  Or should I say WhitFAIL?",0
"Overpriced and rude.. I wont give this place (or the asshole attendant) another cent of my money. \n\nThere was a spot on my hood so I was using the squeegee to get it off (it was less then the size of a dime) when the attendant runs out and tells me to stop using the squeegee on my hood. His reasoning, that the next person to use it expects a clean squeegee.. this doesn't make one bit of sense.. what would be the difference of me cleaning dead bugs off of my windshield or from the hood of my car? Nothing. Whether I used it on my hood or on my windshield the squeegee is getting dirty. \n\nAll it takes is one rude asshole to alienate a customer which he did with flying colors.",0
"I have been frequenting gas stations for many years now and I have seen my fair share of dumps. I can't vouch for the quality of gas other than my car hasn't had fuel filter issues, but I can say the service there sucks. Their cc swipe on the pumps weren't working and I had to go in, to which I found two clerks chewing gum and leaning on the back wall behind the counter. I had to ask for them to ring me up. You would have thought that I asked them to change my tire. I know working at a gas station probably isn't their dream job, but it is their job at least for a little bit.",0
"I should give negative stars!! Went in for an oil change and trip check Friday April 25, 2014. I had planned a surprise Disneyland trip for my family and needed everything in tip top shape. Well right before our last mountain pass to San Diego, my check engine light is flashing and you smell something burning. There was a heaven sent heavy machinery auto shop at the top of the mountain that helped us as much as they could. Surprise surprise! My oil plug wasn't put back in properly. My car leaked all the oil. The engine ran so rough it broke my motor mount...now there is oil in the spark plug well. A cylinder went out, and ive went though 8 quarts of oil in 4 days!!! We cant even register an oil reading. Now I'm stuck in Anaheim, CA and I have work tomorrow. Kids have school. Completely ruined this trip!! Shame on you guys!!! This is not the end of this....STAY AWAY!!!!!! These good reviews must be friends of the owner....super shady!!!!",0
"Trustworthy staff, low prices, and friendly customer service. What more do you want?",1
"Honest, straightforward, great workers! These are not usually adjectives to describe most repair services, but it describes Reliance. Thank you Dalen for the great service you provided.

"I saw the reviews, need to take my sick turtle in for examination and they agreed to get me in right away. The quoted me $69.50 over the phone for the visit but once I got there, they said they misquoted me and it would be a $100. I keep the visit, saw the doctor and he recommended a $100 lab test + possibly tube feeding at a costs into the thousands. The total visit was $220. I later found out that the procedures where unnecessary and the charges where way over inflated. These guys are out just to make a buck off of you. Do yourself a favor and find another vet that cares more about pets then just your money.",0
"Dr. Babcock is very unprofessional and only cares about your money, not your pet! I took my sick dog (chihuahua-dachsund mix) in yesterday because his symptoms were: not eating or drinking, fever, lethargic, and muscle contractions/shivering. I met with Dr. Babcock and felt uncomfortable almost right away with him. He called my dog a \""""she\"""" at first and said my dog might have parvo. I informed him that my dog (who is 2 years old) has already had parvo vaccinations, but Babcock still ran a test to make sure I wasn't lying. Sure enough, the parvo test came back negative. Then, he asked me what my money situation was, which I thought was completely unprofessional. He said some of his patients will spend thousands of dollars without question to help their sick animals but others cannot afford that much so there are other options. I told him I did not have thousands of dollars to throw down and he told me my other option would be to run an urinalysis, blood test, IV fluid, and antibiotic shot because my dog was in \""""serious condition.\"""" He said he was unable to give me any diagnosis until he ran some tests. All of my dog's tests came back negative. Later that day, Dr. Babcock followed up with me and I asked him if I should try giving my dog any food. He said no, that it would just make things worse. Well I later gave my dog some chicken soup and he ate all of it! And was fine afterwards. Dr. Babcock claimed that he thought my dog had an intestinal parasite which is why he didn't think I should give him food. Okay, if my dog had a fucking parasite, then he'd be throwing up! My boyfriend took my dog to a different vet today and they said he had a slipped disc in his neck from playing too much with other dogs. Why wasn't Dr. Stupidcock able to diagnose something like that??? Oh and the total amount I spent yesterday at Palo Verde was: $513.00. If you love your pet and want an honest diagnosis, do NOT go see Dr. Babcock!",0
"While my girlfriend has already reviewed these clowns, I thought I would take a moment to convey to all of you what a bunch of clowns this place has. We have a 2 year old chihuahua/daschund mix that was very obviously in distress Tuesday night. On Wednesday morning my girlfriend took him to Dr. Babcock's crew at PVAH. \n\nI received a phone call while she was in the exam room with him at 9 am thursday morning where Dr. Babcock felt it appropriate to explain to me that I need to prepare myself to spend \""""up to three thousand dollars on Muddy because he has a very life threatening condition\"""". At no point did this joker elaborate on what he thought the problem might be. He just seemed to want to play off of our emotions in a clearly taxing time to try and milk us for more money. After paying these clowns over 500 dollars for a parvo cite test, a barium test, a full blood work up, urinalysis, a 500ml IV, and an antibiotic injection we left with an untreated dog.\n\n After seeing no improvement by Thursday and being told to be prepared to \""""spend thousands\"""" by these @ssholes we elected to see an old family veterinarian that my parents adore. After being in the other office for only 10 minutes the other vet (We'll call him Dr. Competent) found that our dog had a herniated disc in his neck after a cursory range of motion exam. The difference between the two Veterinarians? Dr. Competent took the time to examine our puppy dog and demonstrate genuine care for his well being as well as demonstrating himself as a competent practitioner of veterinary medicne. \n\nTurn the aggravation scale up to about half\n\nAfter our exam with Dr. Competent, the staff at the other clinic was kind enough to take a look at the bill from PVAH and they nearly fell over. I have seen some pretty shady characters operate (I own an auto-repair shop so you can imagine) but these assholes take the cake for shadiest crap I have seen since I have been in Phoenix. I was finally informed at the end of my visit to the second veterinarian that all the treatment options that these jokers tried to sell us we obviously not needed except to increase my bill. \n\nNow I'm pissed\n\nThis place sucks in ways I cannot even begin to explain. When I say take your animals to ANYWHERE OTHER THAN THESE CROOKS, I really do mean it. These @ssholes will try their level best to take advantage of you and your wallet during a very difficult time. My Verdict: Screw this place and the pack of crooks that infest it....",0
"This is the worst service ever. I went in with a complaint of animal that couldnt walk and was in pain. Ross Babcock is old and should retire. Just like the previous person he proceeded to do a physical exam to see if anything was broken, good thing nothing was broken. During his doing the exam the animal whimpered but Babcock was to deaf to hear it. He proceeded to talk down to me and tell me nothing was wrong with his he wasnt in pain and there is no pain medications to give this animal and did more tests. Come to find out this is what happens in the end stages of animals life.. I am sad my animal died the next day so if you worried about your animal RUN FAR AWAY FROM HERE!!!!!",0
receptionist was very rude and i would never take my pet here!,0
We've used them for dog boarding when we go on vacations. Our dog always appears to be in good health upon arrival. We've used them for many years.,1
"This place is horrible!!! I got my dog from a shelter, took him here for his first vet visit and was told he needed all of this work done. I walked out of there paying $600 for medication, plus all the \""""work\"""" he needed done was going to cost over $1,000. I was freaking out and it just didn't seem right. I met this guy at a dog park and told him about it, and he said he took his dog there too and said that place is horrible. He recommended me to another place. After taking him here I was told he didn't need any of that work done. \n\nI would NEVER recommend this place to anyone. They were VERY impersonal and all they cared about was my money. I'm a person who goes off the vibe I feel when I first walk into a place. If I'm not comfortable there must be a reason. Sure enough, there was! This place is HORRIBLE!!!",0
"I so wish I would have read Yelp before taking my dog here. They are horrible !!!  I called when my dog landed wrong on her leg and was limping. When I called I was quoted 66.58 for the exam and 114.00 if xrays were needed. The tech was awful. It appeared as though she has no idea what she was  doing. The doctor examined her pulled extremely hard on her shoulder to get her to yelp. He said she needed xrays. The tech said it was going to be 215.00. I explained to her that I was quoted differently , but they would not honor the quote. It took over 25 minuets to take them. The doctor came in and told me( with props) that he screened her for valley fever by looking at her bones. I did not bring her in for screenings . I took her there for a potential injury. Had I been told that he was doing the xray for another reason, I would have not said yes. He went on to try to sell me everything from 400.00 tests ( insisting that many dogs in Arizona get valley fever and need to be screened) to counseling because my dog is overweight and I need to be trained on how to feed her. So insulting !!!! He said he was giving me medication. He did not ask if I wanted it , nor did he tell me it was over 50.00. It turned out to be pain medication she did not need, nor did I use it.  The only pain she was in at the office is when he pulled on her until she was in discomfort.  They have no interest in the well being of an animal , just the well being of their cash register. I intend to follow up with a complaint to the BBB. I hope to recoup some of my money for charges( xrays) that were not necessary for her diagnosis. Shame on them for feeding off a pet owner's concern to make a buck !!!",0
"Horrible hospital, very impersonal! The doctor only cares about money and is rude! I would never ever recommend this place to anyone! If you don't like your job, get another one! Some of us actually care about our pets and want them to live happily and healthy!",0
"I have a long sleeved shirt from Dizzy's that I have worn through at the wrists and one of the elbows.

Yeah for Dive Bars! A good Dive Bar to me is one where you can come in and feel completely at ease no matter who you are or what you are wearing. The bartender is super relaxed but helpful and can make a mean cocktail. The lighting is dark and moody and the jukebox has good tunes.\n\nDizzy's is pretty much a solid bet on all these items except for all the damn country music that some patrons think is listenable.,1
Pleasantly surprised.....with this little find!  We went there to see a friend from out of town play for a fundraiser for a child who is ill.  It's definitely something you'd find near the beach.  $3 drafts...and full bar.  Packed house....just North of the Vig UpTown.  Definitely a casual dive and fun too!,1
Used to be a great dive to shoot pool/darts. Now over priced and boring. Might as well be a Starbucks,0

"-Limited selection of stuff. (the building looks so HUGE on the outside, but ONLY a small area is used for the Thrift Store). \n\n-Most of the few things they have is crap from the 80's and '90's, so I guess it belongs in a thrift store...if you like that kind of stuff.\n\n-No funky smells, probably because there isn't a ton of misc stuff to create one huge thrift store aroma.\n\n-If you want to see the employees FREAK OUT, just wander into their break room by mistake, since it looks like part of the Thrift Store.

"One of my favorite places to go...just lost not only my respect but my money. \n\nThey had the same sale on the same day for weeks on end. This same sale since i started going here. Never had signs, they would just come up and tell you. \nSo today when I go back again, the only thing on sale was clothes!!! \n\nAt the check the nice cashier was ringing everything up 50% off and out of no where the oldest lady of the group said no, only clothes are on sale. They disagreed and I explained to the older lady I have always been told these items were on sale on this day. \n\nThe oldest lady who was Adamant about the sale said it wasn't true. The other two ladies disagreed and wanted to give me the discount but she kept saying that sale never existed. \n\nAs I was walking away she said to the other cashier \"""" that wasn't true\"""".

"Gallaghers is a good neighborhood bar.  They have good drinks, passable food, Sports on TV, and a very friendly staff.  They also have free wifi.  I guess that means you can bet on the internet about the sports you are watching while you drink and watch with friends.",1
"Eh, to be honest, as much fun as I had partying with my fellow Yelpers on Sunday, I can't give this place a sparkling review.  As much as I'd love to give a neighborhood sports bar props, this place just did too many things wrong for me to comply.\n\nWent there with a bunch rowdy Yelpers to watch the NFC Championship game on Sunday and was fairly disappointed.  For starters, as a sports bar and Cardinals viewing destination that had been promoting themselves as \""""the place to watch the big game,\"""" they seemed grossly unprepared for the crowd they got.\n\nFor starters, I sat at my table for about 15 minutes before I gave up on a server coming over to take my drink/food order, and went up to the bar to order and take the middleman out of the equation.  Only when I went up to the bar did I learn that they had run out of glasses!!!\n\nThis is where it gets good though.  Their drink specials that I was interested in were their $2.50 20 oz domestic drafts, pretty good deal if you ask me.  And since they had run out of glasses (definitely not my fault as I am not their barware supplier) and the bartender asked me to get a bottle instead, I naiively assumed they would honor at least a similar deal to the one that they were promoting.\n\nThis is where I was SORELY mistaken.  Not only did they not give me my 12 oz bottle for the same price as the 20 oz draft that they were unable to serve me, they actually had the nerve to upcharge me to $3 per bottle!!!\n\nNeedless to say, I was a bit incensed.  And it had nothing to do with the extra 50 cents per drink, I just thought it was poor business practice...a bit of a bait and switch, if you will.\n\nAfter the initial poor service and swindling of my hard earned $$, the bar ended up being okay.  Of course I will have to attribute at least 75% of this to the wonderful company of my yelp compadres, who I hate to disappoint with my less than stellar review, but I have to keep it real.  The TVs were big and plentiful, the food was fair.  I ordered a Buffalo Chicken Wrap which wasn't bad but my fries were SUPER cold and therefore inedible to me.  But the bar's sorry excuse for a smoking section is what threw me over the edge and made me want to puke on more than one occasion.\n\nWe had the bad luck of being sat in the general vicinity of the door that led outside to the smoking section, and every time the door was opened either by a server or a patron, you could literally see plumes and plumes of smoke wafting into the restaurant.  It was disgusting.  I couldn't stay even 5 minutes longer after the Cards won to celebrate because I was coughing and my eyes were starting to water.\n\nI am willing to give Gallaghers 1 more shot under the parameters that there can be no special event going on because they were terribly ill equipped to handle it, and mainly due to the fact that they had tons of TVs and it is relatively close to my house.\n\nAs long as the don't run out of glasses again of course...",0
"I come back because the ladies pour a good whiskey & 7 and the wings are awesome. The Happy hour drink prices also get me to return. I like the decor of the bar and it draws a good regular crowd. Not into the off-site track beating but it's there. Both the bartenders I have dealt with have been really nice and made an effort to remember my name on a later visit. That's pretty nice, makes you feel a bit welcome. can always find a regular to shoot the breeze with for a moment if you stick around and say hello. It's alright place.

"So this is my first review because it is hard for me to review restaurants. Having worked in the industry for years i am a little more forgiving than most. So we ordered calamari, it came out black but being adventurous i tried it thinking it was a different kind of breading. Boy was i wrong! It was completely burnt. So we sent it back our other food came out and then the new calamari came out.  Much better this time until we got down to the plate. It was the old plate, same lettuce same number lemons we squeezed on the batch. As some one who has cooked for a living i want to know how lazy a person has to be to do that.

"What a horrible experience!!!!!\n\nSo I went to meet with a friend who was in town for her PHD program at Grand Canyon University.  She and several of her classmates decided to head to this hell hole for a friend's marriage proposal get together.  Since I worked all day, rushed home to wash up, and then headed straight there, I was hot and starving. \n\nThey are overly disorganized.  My friend and her classmates reserved a certain amount of tables, and yet they were not already prepared for us.  We had to wait for them to finish putting the tables together.  Strike 1\n\nHappy Hour had just finished and I was not in the mood to pay full price for a drink from such an establishment, so I had one of the cheap Moose Beer cans for $3.00, it was rather tasty, surprisingly.\n\nSo, the service here is very very very very slow!!!!!! I ordered the barbeque-bacon turkey burger, and it literally took an hour to come out! It did not look appealing and so I spoke with the manager, who was not very customer service driven.  Strike 2\n\nWhen we were served our food, the silverware did not come along with it as well.  Strike 3\nSince, I have worked in the restaurant industry and I wrote food and wine reviews and blogs, I know what is supposed to happy when a client is not happy with the service, or the food.  Apparently the manager did not know, he then took the food away and said that he would take it off of the bill.  He was supposed to leave the food, let me finally eat it, and then still take it off of the bill.  My friend had to go and hunt him down with my food and so he brought it back out.  But, I was so annoyed that I left it sitting right there, to prove a point that I was not that hungry to eat their trash food after waiting an hour and then having it taken away!!!\n\nThe waitress was frazzled, the manager was incompetent, and the sound system was horrible for karaoke.  They need to close down, re-train everyone, and hire more staff!!",0
"Gallaghers has never really been considered a nice bar... I do not know many people who would consider this a staple. Its there, if you ever need it...\n\n~Fud/Drinks~\nThe food is bland. Lets just call it as it is. Salads are a best example as to how a restaurant treats its menu. If its got good salads, then they must have amazing entrees. Well this works well for Gallagher's, because their salads are meh meh meh. I tried a Greek salad, which for some reason, comes with iceberg lettuce, crispy, dry, iceberg lettuce. SERIOUSLY!? All the other ingredients including the feta  tasted like they just came out of the box/can they were shipped in. Horrible food choices besides the salads. Greasy, overpriced bar foods that really serve no purpose than to make you fat. Lets just say the ingredients in all their foods are lacking significantly. The drinks are typical bar options. Beer selection is OK, nothing stellar, but at least they carry some local options. But nothing to note that will turn heads, just average.\n\n~Atmosphere~\nThere is no atmosphere really. Like an Applebee's, they put things on the wall and expect that to make the atmosphere of the room. No, it doesn't. There really is no ambiance or significant feel, its weird being that its a sports bar. The carpets are drab, by the way... just wanted  to point out that does not add to the experience. Waitstaff are pretty attentive, they do an OK job. But ya, the crowds aren't lively, and I can definitely name some other places you can feel the true sports-bar experience at. \n\n~Extras/Rating~\nThere is really nothing to add, other than the fact that an amazing resort, the Pointe Hilton, is literally a 1 minute walk away. They have amazing food options there, although its not sports oriented. They do have the Hole-in-the Wall restaurant as well, which is amazing western Bar-B-Q. Go there, honestly. This place gets two stars for being an average/below average sports bar chain with nothing much to offer. Their business model needs an update, there are some outstanding local pubs and eateries out here that loyal clients flock to.",0
"The only good thing about this place (other than it is walking distance to a resort that I frequent) are the waitresses and bartenders, who are cute and friendly. Otherwise the place pretty much sux. The food is mediocre at best. The vibe is lame. The worst part is that they do karaoke there alot, and it is loud and obnoxious. This place has pretty much run it's course. Time for it to close and re-open as something else. Hopefully under new ownership. And minus the karaoke.",0
Boneless wings are delicious however does not make up for the crappy service. Waitress was unfriendly and too busy. Threw a printed piece of paper my way when I asked what was on tap and seemed preoccupied with her kids talking to her. Rarely checked back probably because my boyfriend and I are younger and she assumed wed be bad tippers because all the tables around us got plenty of attention. Here's the kicker michelob ultra is considered a premium here. I'm a bartender in the majority of the bars that I frequent and work for this is not the case. When I asked for a manager her attitude was snotty about it. I won't be back.,0
"The food is poorly prepared, over cooked and hard fried.  Service was shameful.  I was by myself and practically ignored.  Go somewhere else.  The prices aren't that great.  There are plenty of better establishments for drinks and appetizers.",0
"Went here tonight, will never be back.\n\nThe food is typical bar food, nothing too extraordinary, I already knew what to expect from previous visits. But the service was beyond bad.\n\nJust an obvious example of poor training and poor management. Our poor server was obviously sent out to the wolves and had never served before.. (mind you she had 2 tables.) \n\nThe most annoying part, was that the manager literally went to the table in the middle of the restaurant, SAT down with them, and explained that this server was new and had messed up stuff earlier.. I could hear the entire conversation. How unprofessional can you be? I understand we were at a \""""sports bar\"""" but to throw your own employess under the bus is just messed up. \n\nNot only that but why couldnt they maybe come around to every single table (3) and see if they needed anything? Or maybe HELPED out your servers rather than needing them to go and find you while you are outside smoking? Ridiculous.\n\nId like to be able to say \""""Oh it was a busy night I understand.\"""" But this was obsurd, at one point I even went to the bartender to ask for my sons water (The server brought out all the alcoholic beverages BEFORE bringing my sons water) And the bartender gave me a look like I was asking for her to do backflips, told me she didn't have \""""To go cups\"""" and rolled her eyes.\n\nThis place obviously doesn't work as a team, and it shows..\nNever mind the crappy food, dont go here just plain and simple because the service absolutely sucks and the management and other employess obviously do not care how their restaurant is portrayed.",0
"Best waste of a Saturday night, the fact that the place was empty should have really sent the red flags flying! Meal made it to the table before the appetizer, soup and salad and yet the nonchalant attitude regarding the issue really baffled me (this is not a new place of business) anyway, don't waste your time and money here!\nIt is too bad that there are no zero stars options.",0
i will only give it 2 stars b/c the dj for karoake was awesome and the food was good. on the negatives-some of the worst service i've ever had and i've been to a lot of bars/restaurants. the server repeatedly forgot my tables drinks. at one point i just went up to the bar to get a refill-it was so much quicker. my fiance went to get my one drink that was sitting at the bar for 10 minutes when she saw that she got it and gave it to me saying there was computer problems-hmm yea right. i had to ask for my check twice because i was waiting for 20 minutes for it. just terrible and i could on but i'll spare you. trust me i was a server for years so i understand getting slammed but it wasn't busy and she should've asked for help and not made up that there was computer problems. also i got a mixed drink and so did my friend and it didn't taste like any alcohol. despite all this my friends and i still had a really good time b/c of karoake. still don't think ill be back there anytime soon.,0
Good place to hang out and finish up some work. Relaxed atmosphere with lots of locals mixed in with travelers. \n\nWould recommend 100%,1
"We sat down and waited forever, no one even addressed us. It was not busy so there's no reason for them to have such horrible service. Don't go here!",0
"Fun place, yummy food and a great place to watch football. Very attentive wait staff.",1
"Great place.  They're honest, fair priced and they do quality work.  They'll work on any make or year, I have older vehicles and some of them are obsolete and difficult to find parts for but they're always able to come up with a solution.  I highly recommend Crutcher Automotive.",1
"Before writing this, I had it all planned out in my head. First sentence: \""""I can't believe I actually went here and am admitting it\"""" but it's obviously a popular spot for yelpers. Crazy.\n\nMy mom and dad suckered me into meeting them here and it's kind of awful and agreeably Americanized Chinese food. My parents just love this place and think it's the best Chinese in town*.\n\nEverything tasted totally \""""off\""""... even the fried rice, which quizzically had none of the ingredients I'm used to it having. The water tasted dirty and I saw 2 NASCAR t-shirts while I was here (these set my \""""check engine\"""" light on immediately).\n\n\n*This both confuses and comforts me... I can finally put to rest dreams of my parents reverting back to their free-wheeling, adventurous, hippie personality types they once graced this world with. They are now Bush-loving Republicans, and I am... okay with this. Breathe, Norma.",0
"This has always been our favorite local Chinese take out - and especially on Chinese New Year, the special menu.  OMG its good.  We always call for takeout, one or two items and we are so close that by the time I get in the car and drive there, its done...less than five minutes.  \n\nThis place gets very busy, and if you get a chance, try out their Peking Duck, Hong Kong style.  Soooo delicious!\n\nAnother favorite is the snow pea leaves (not on the menu!!!  cost extra), and the Seafood Bean Curd Soup.  I love the soup here, so many delicious morsels, you can't go wrong with it ever.",1
"I used to live right around the corner from this restaurant, so it was a frequent destination for my wife and myself.  We went to their grand opening way back when. Alas now we live too far away, but we make a special trip to dine or take out when we can. (Sorry Kam!)\n\nMy wife and I lived in the SF Bay area for 14 years so we have made our way around a Chinese menu or two. I try to stay away from the obvious Americanized menu items and take suggestions from our server as to what is fresh and special.  I have never been disappointed with their suggestions off the Chinese menu and regular menu. Sometimes you will get lucky and they have fresh mushrooms, clams, crab, whole fish etc...I have a soft spot for anything noodle and their \""""dry\"""" chow fun is one of my favorites.\n\nI have found this place to be one of the better Chinese restaurants in town.",1
"Decent food, but bad service. Our waitress must have had an egg roll up her butt or something that was distracting her. In all my years of dining I don't think I've ever had a server come to the table, ask only one of the two people sitting there what they wanted to drink, then walk away. Seriously - she got my friend's drink order and walked away! WTF? But then, get this, she did it again, when she came back with my friend's drink and asked if we were ready to order, I ordered my drink, and then she turned to my friend, got her order, and then turned to walk away. I stopped her this time, of course. Oh, and then later, she took my glass to get me a refill, and when she didn't come back for ten minutes, I started looking around for her, and there she was, wandering around the restaurant with it, no idea which table it was from.. The food was decent, like I said, nothing special, but edible, but with that kind of service, I ain't going back.",0
"Not great but I ate it. I think everything just lacked flavor. Americanized Chinese food for sure, and I'm fine with that but everything needed salt or something, weak in flavor. I tried it but wont be back. I wanted to like  it cause I live close by.",0
"I hate to give a place two stars, but it was entirely based on the food.    I didn't really like anything I ordered.  The service was fine, and the ambiance was pleasant enough...\n\nI had the won ton soup, house fried rice and the Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce.  The won tons were cool in the middle and the soup had frozen veggies in it - I have never seen won ton soup with peas.  \n\nThe house fried rice was flat and greasy.  My dinner companion commented that the house fried rice was more like what you find on the east coast, if that means anything to you.\n\nThe sauce ion the broccoli was twice as salty as they soy sauce.  Frankly, I was just really unimpressed.  I won't be back.\n\nDoes anyone know where to get good Chinese in Phoenix, because I sure don't.",0
"I don't do sit down chinese food very much, but would highly recommend this one.  The service was excellent.  The food was very good.  Had fried dumplings (great), spring rolls (best i've had in a long while) and orange chicken.  My husband, child and I got out of there full, with leftovers, for about $25.",1
"Tasty dishes - I had panfried noodles/shrimp, had vegetables; my husband had orange shrimp, had broccoli, not too spicy. But service was indifferent and menu didn't explain what was in each dish.",1
"Ugh. Ugh ugh ugh. I hate reading reviews where the person just complains and complains, but...this is about to be one of those reviews.\n\nThings must have changed here in the last few years because I remember ordering from here in high school and the food was good. I went here recently with a friend. She ordered sweet and sour chicken and I ordered beef chow mein. The water didn't even taste right...it had a really weird aftertaste and I avoided it after the first sip. My friend's sweet and sour chicken is what awarded this place the 2 stars I gave it, but my chow mein was ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. I can't even say that it was beef I was served (sorry to have to make the usual Chinese restaurant reference, but truly, it did not taste or smell like beef at all). When the waitress came by and saw I had not touched 99% of my food, she asked if everything was okay and if I needed a box. I informed her that I was not happy with the way the meat was cooked, and she said, \""""Hmm\"""" and walked away. Apparently that was a sufficient response, and I didn't hear another word from her afterwards.\n\nThere are so, so, so many better places to get Chinese from in Phoenix, even in this neighborhood...just don't come here.",0
"Super Dragon is my favorite Chinese restaurant. It was a wonderful surprise after so many disappointing buffets and sit down Chinese restaurants. The egg drop soup, crab puffs, orange chicken, Cantonese noodles, and pork fried rice are my favorite foods to get there - but you can't go wrong here. Everything is delicious! \n\nThe service is fantastic. You are seated as soon as you walk in the door, and you won't wait more than ten minutes to get your food. They keep your drinks full and will pack up your leftovers for you. Great prices too. I eat here at least once a week.",1
"awful, food is bad and there is nogood service.",0
"Too bad that my first review on Yelp is a negative one :( . I went to Super Dragon today. I ordered Kung Poa chicken, and I could not eat it. The chicken tasted really really bad, as if they re heated it (the taste of left over chicken), also the rice comes on the side in a pot that you scoop from and it will go to other guests after you finish. well who knows if the guest before you did scoop properly with out making a mess, without coughing, sneezing or even laughing over the rice pot while scooping? I was totally unsatisfied.",0
"Food is great!! Prompt customer service, a little pushy but they are on it. My glass was never empty and food is prepared perfectly everytime. Never any undercooked mushy rice. The house chicken is crispy and the sauce is not like any other house sauce. The sizzling rice soup is what got me hooked. It's full of flavor, egg drop, pork, shrimp, chicken, water chestnuts, veggies, and the rice.",1
"As many of you know, it ain't easy getting good Chinese food in Phoenix.  Super Dragon is really one of the only places that does it right for my taste.  The employees are very friendly and provide excellent service.  The food is always good, and it comes out fast.  I haven't ordered take-out from them, but I have some friends who have and they say it's quick and efficient.  They have a pretty good list for their inexpensive lunch menu.  The dinner offerings are more extensive, and offer a good selection--especially if you like family-style dining.",1
"Love this restaurant!! Clean,amazing service and great food. I've loved everything I've tried, but the house chicken and xo string beans are my favorite! I've been several times and have also placed to go orders and have never been disappointed. If you like Chinese food, this place is a must. You are always greeted immediately and drinks are refilled as soon as your empty. They also give you free hot green tea. Can't say enough about how much I love this place!",1
Delicious!  Even though they are a little pricey they are well worth it.  The staff is also very sweet! Get the sweet and sour chicken and the pork fried rice!,1
Great food. Clean and quick. Great Prices. The only thing we did not like was the Egg Foo Young. Mu Shu Grill at 15th ave and Thomas still has the best Egg Foo Young. But we loved everything else here.,1
"Extremely bland American Chinese food, without much authentic fare.  Entr\u00e9es lack flavor and are very oily.  The fried wonton are a good snack or appetizer though!  I would recommend driving out to Chandler over dining here though.",0
"I was given a tour of the Desert Mission Food Bank and some of the neighbor John C Lincoln buildings several weeks ago.  For whatever reason, I didn't think to yelp about it until now...\n\nThe staff at Desert Mission Food Bank was extremely friendly.  Megan showed me around and gave me a history on how it came to be.  It's actually a fascinating story, but I will let you explore on your own to learn more.  \n\nI don't have much to compare this to as this was my first visit to a food bank, so I had no clue what to expect.  I was extremely impressed on how organized the place was and how many people I saw shopping there.  The food bank allows those that qualify to maximize their budget and get what they need to put food on the table for their families.  It relies on support from our community.  With the economy in the dumps lately, it's nice to know that Desert Mission is there for those that need it.\n\nI look forward to volunteering at the Desert Mission Food Bank on November 1st.  If you are reading this and interested in joining (we'll have a small group), PM me for the details or check the Events calendar.",1
"This is a fairly large place, & nice inside.  It had a couple of TVs playing, but not too loudly, as a moderate crowd joined me for dining on about 55 trays of food at lunchtime.  The hot & sour soup was neither, & while some of the hot food items were good, a lot of it was too oily for my taste.  There were several shrimp dishes, which was nice, & the service was friendly & attentive, but the price was a little high at $7.45 for lunch.\n\nCrown China Super Buffet down the street is a better choice.",0
The food was quite good at this buffet.  Veggies were cooked to my liking.  And lots of varities of goodies to feast on.,1
= = = = = =  CLOSED  = = = = = =\n\nThis one has closed (& we're just as well off without it).     :-),0
"Was really good. I got a calzone from here, it was tasty. They had a lot of traffic coming in and out, so they must be really known.\n\nplus the customer service is extremely good.",1
"everything about this place spits hot fire, and spitting hot fire is gooooooood!  Chase and the crew rock it without even breaking a sweat.  Pizza. Wings. all great, but if you think you are ready for it, try the italian sub on crispy sourdough, hot with everything and habanero mayo,  call it \""""The Matt\"""" BOOM! Instant classic.  Don't even try another sub in the state, it's a waste of time.  Stumpy's is it.",1
"With the heavenly smells of browning crust and cooking toppings greeting me upon walking in the door, it was like entering in a neighborhood pizzeria that I'd been going to my entire life with its almost-tangible, homey comfort. And as soon as I saw the pizzas on the tables around me, I knew that I had found something special.\n\nHaving phoned-in my pizza order for take-out, I stepped up to the register to pay and noticed a sign suggesting that I try a cannoli for dessert... Cannolis! Are you serious?! It's like someone took my favorite fattening foods (minus cheddar goldfish crackers & McDonalds fries) and crammed them into one easy-to-access location.  I'm sensing a lot more exercise in my future to offset the caloric intake (and yes, I did have them add a cannoli to my order)... anyway... back to the pizza!\n\nIt's probably good that I drive a stick-shift car because it was all that I could do to not grab a piece and start munching on my ride back home. After seeing all the other pizzas at the restaurant and imagining how they tasted, the smells permeating my car were like an intoxicating siren's call. After an extremely long, ten minute drive back to my house, I was finally able to open up the box that contained my treasure: a Greek pizza... Kalmata olives, banana peppers, red onion, artichoke hearts, feta & mozzarella cheeses piled on top of a crust that I would call just about perfect.",1
I have a passion for great pizza.  It's been my favorite food since I was a kid. I've outgrown my fondness for the typical pep & sausage as my tastebuds have been seeking out new flavors. The first time I tried the Gourmet White Pizza at Stumpy's I believe I heard the chorus to Hallelujah! Another favorite of mine is the Hot Blue Chicken Wing Pizza...an explosion of flavorful deliciousness! So good...I am actually salivating over my keyboard just thinking about it! Anyway...Stumpy's is by far one of my most favorite pizza places. Another giant plus? The owners and staff are the most amazingly friendly people I have ever met. They greet everyone with a warm smile and a wonderful pizza!,1
"Good pizza, nice people, great rock and roll. Coupons, too. What more can you ask?",1
"If you're looking for the best Brooklyn style pie in Phoenix, this is it. Those other places...fugheddaboutit. My personal favorite is \""""The Meats \"""" Pizza, although I've had \""""The Works\"""" as well. ask for fresh garlic.\n\nMy kids love their pizza crisp and my wife loves the manicotti.\n\nIf you want wings and pizza try their Buffallo Bleu Cheese Pizza.",1
"A \""""neighborhood joint\"""" that's closed on Sundays during football season???",0
"After working in the area for 2 years I finally checked out Stumpy's on the suggestion of a friend, and wow, I was missing out! \n\nThe place is small and no frills, but they are churning out some huge sandwiches with quality ingredients and some delicious looking pizza.  While $9.50 including tax, for a sub, drink and chips sounds a bit pricey, the sandwich can easily cover you for 2 meals.  While I waited for my to go order, the slices of pizza I saw coming out of the oven where huge!  They had thin crusts and were piled high with toppings, I almost wanted to change my order....but I guess I will just have to come back another day!",1
"Decided to stop here for my lunch today since I was craving a Meatball Sub. The Italian Bread was crunchy on the outside and chewy in the center (which I love). It's baked with the Mozzarella Cheese on it, and it melts all over the sandwich. Although, that makes the bread under the cheese kind of soggy which I didn't like, but the rest of it made up for this. Otherwise I'd have given Stumpy's 5 stars.\n\nThe meatballs were good and I could actually taste them. They don't douse the sub in marinara making it all soggy, which I also like. I barely finished my sub and I should have stopped eating it earlier but it was too good!\n\nI was watching them make pizza in the back, and it looks like they make pizza slices to order. They even roll out the dough for each individual order. And like everyone else mentioned, they staff there was really polite and friendly. All said and done I spent $10, and felt like it was worth it. I'll be back, and next time I'll try their pizza.\n\nUPDATED 5/22/12 - Had the meatball sub a 2nd time, and the bread was not soggy even with the extra cheese. I had a (3) slice of \""""The Butcher\"""" pizza. Loved it. This place is extremely friendly, small, and good food. Updated from 4, to 5 stars.",1
"A true Sunnyslope gem. Im not even kidding when I say we order atleast once a week.... Pizza is phenomonal and the wings are GREAT! We have had one run in with an employee being rude but, Mrs. Stumpy messaged us on yelp and we great about it! We appreciated it. There can be long delivery times but, thats because, ITS SO GOOD EVERYONE WANTS IT! Im telling you amazing. A lot cheaper than spinatos and a lot more (If you're in the area and can't pick) Delivery is cheap too so we don't even have to leave! We came in for lunch one day and the cashier who was a lady (Amber? Amanda?) Can't remember but, was SO Nice!",1
"Coming into this place I wasn't too impressed. Mainly by the looks on the inside of the building. Fairly old looking. However many people told me this was good so i decided to give it a shot. For the most part the pizza was really good, a little too greasy, but thats not a big deal. The prices also could have been better. $6 for 2 slices and a soda, isn't that great a deal. You could go to Barro's Pizza and get the exact same for $4. However i'm sure that I will return.",1
"Awesome experience.  We were visiting, and saw the reviews on yelp and stopped by.  Kids loved the pizza, and I had an excellent calzone.  Husband enjoyed the meatball sub too.  Quick, good bread.",1
"Ok, I went back and I had the BBQ Chicken Pizza.  I added bacon.  It was completely and ridiculously delicious.  The chicken was tender, juicy and delicious.  It tasted like it had just come right off the grill!!!\n\nI absolutely recommend trying the specialty pizzas.  This place is great and a treasure in my local area!",1
"Their pizza and subs are great.  I would have given them a 5 star, but for whatever reason they totally got my last order all messed up.  I don't care though..... going back again to get the veggie pizza and hot italian sub!!!!  Totally laid back crew and delicious food.  Nobody is perfect :)\n\nGO!  GET SOME GOOD EATS!!",1
Great Pizza for the money. Love the crunchy crust. Great flavor to the sauce. I always ask for extra sauce and they add on with no problem. Only downer is there is not much room to dine in. Great dive pizza joint.,1
I hate giving bad reviews. Actually this is the lowest review I've ever given. I'm not sure what else to do when I pay $23 for a pizza that arrives cold and so soggy it's completely inedible. Straight to the garbage and off to buy dinner for the second time tonight. Awesome.,0
"Very Poor Customer Service Skills. Got a sandwich to go. Got all the way home to find the bottom of sandwich seeping with fluids and soggy enough bread to bait a hook! Drive back and informed them. Even though they remade the sandwich not one person offered me a discount on my next order or anything to compensate me for my additional time and inconvenience.  Generally, the food is very good but their is a serious lack of customer service...",0
Ordered a takeout order online to be ready at 7:55 show up at 8:00 to pick it up and they were just putting it in the oven... It was ready at 8:20. They didn't even apologize. Overpriced for such bad service. I won't be eating here again.,0
"Ordered a pizza, slow as molasses.  That being said, everyone has a bad day.  This place is one of my favorites in Arizona.  Try the plain pepperoni (don't need to get too fancy, this is a winner).  Addon the antipasta sale, and \""""suicide wings\"""" and you are good to guy.  For the courageous at heart - go with the Philly Cheesesteak pizza (a super surprising treat).\n\nIf you get delivery, don't forget to ask for parmesan and peppers (they never bring it no matter how much I tip - which is always very generous).  Oh well.\n\nHave fun, and find your sizzle!\n\nAttorney Steve, the business and real estate lawyer.\nhttp://www.attorneysteve.net",1
"We made a big order (8 pizza's, salads, breadsticks) for a family party - all online using their website. \n\nStumpy's came thru wonderfully - the order was on time, accurate, and most importantly, the food was great! Everyone loved the food, from children thru adults.",1
"I love wings..prolly my favorite comfort food- wing pizza, a good idea in concept- extremely difficult to get right in execution. \n\nI moved to the area about a year ago, and found Stumpy's on a hungry wednesday night. They have a pizza called the \""""wingding\""""- easy to glance over. But worth a second look. - This is NOT your typical wing pizza. From the bleu cheese base, to being able to add any of their house wing sauces- it's the most unique, and delicious \""""Wing\"""" Pizza I have ever had. \n\n\nAt this point you might be thinking- ok great- or big deal- that does nothing for me, \""""I'm not a wing person, so what?\""""- Soooo.. This little pizza got me to try just about every pizza they make, their desserts, and their bread sides.  \n\nI've ordered online, (easy, though an account is needed), over the phone, through grubhub at one point, and have dropped by and picked things up quite a few times. Their service has always been exceptional and delivery on time (or early) and the delivery driver courteous. - when ordering for delivery everything, through them has been accurate (there was a confusion on garlic breadsticks once through grubhub)- whether that be online or over the phone. \n\n4/5 for Excellent food, all around, and great consisted quality, both in service and food.  -1 star due to a somewhat clunky online ordering experience, and their crust compared to some, needs the toppings, to make it whole (not the tear it off and munch crust, or cheese and pepperoni pizza crust)- also somewhat pricey com paired to larger chains, no coupons for speciality pizzas that they give out- which would prolly make me come back for a lot more. \n\nAll in all, this is my favorite neighborhood pizza spot. Highly recommended!",1
never again,0
"I will never use GrubHub or eat at Stumpy's again after my last experience. The order took about 30 minutes longer than expected. When it did finally arrive, it was cold and we were missing about 1/3 of the items we ordered. I even pre-tipped them a 30% tip in the hopes that it would arrive a little quicker. Nope. I emailed GrubHub, they said they spoke with Stumpy's and the missing items were on their way. Well nothing ever showed up, the restaurant never refunded our money for the missing items and GrubHub shrugged it off with a \""""we're sorry, here's $5 off your next order\"""" canned reply. That was a fraction of the value of the items we were shorted. This fly-by-night service is DOA in my book. I'll use other local delivery services going forward and steer clear of shady-Stumpy's. I cannot believe they would say they delivered items when they did not - TWICE!!! The whole experience was pathetic and disappointing.",0
"One of the best Italian subs I've ever had. They were also fast, friendly and competent. I can't wait to try their pizza.",1
"I work in the neighborhood, and it's part of my routine to give Stumpy's a visit every Monday.  It's good enough to keep me coming back every time.\n\nThey have a wide selection of toppings for pizza and a good variety of sandwiches if that's your thing (I'm a pizza guy, myself).  It's made fresh right in front of you with quality ingredients.  I'm somewhat of a pizza aficionado, and I always recommend Stumpy's to anyone who enjoys a slice now and then.",1
"Plain. Cheese. Pizza. \n\nIt's freaking amazing. And, Stumpy's delivers. Which is also amazing. That is all.",1
Just ate here today.  A buddy of mine took me. Great sub good pizza! service was nice too. thank guys. Don't make it to your side of town a lot but when I do Im there.,1
"Just picked up my first pizza from there. 16\"""" The Works! Fantastic!! The whole family is hooked. Fresh,flavorful, not greasy.....yummy!!",1
No words needed other than this is how pizza should be. Every single time. The best I have ever had!,1
"I've eaten here a few times now and I was hooked at first bite. Everything so far has been delicious. The whiteout pizza is one of my favorites as well as the hot subs. So far I've tried the veggie and Italian. Both were awesome! I'll be coming back for more! For those ordering delivery, you might want to skip getting a hot sub because mine was soggy on the bottom. Next time I'll eat there or pick up myself, which is no big deal. The staff is very nice.",1
"Every 3000 mi!\nI have been coming to Jiffy Lube for about 10 years! They always know what to put in my cars, know what was put in them last time and never over charge me! \nThey are very quickand clean!\n\nThey usually find me some kind of discount I didn't even know they had!\n\nOver all, they are Great!!",1
"SLOW SLOW SLOW. We waited almost 45 minutes for them to change the oil in two cars that were in progress before we ever arrived. Then it was another 30 minutes to change our oil. No \""""jiffiness\"""" here. Always try to up sell you unnecessary services and products using fear tactics. We won't be back.",0
"Following a tire rotation on 12/26, I found two of the wheel lug nuts only hand tight.  One fell out in a parking lot and was luckily found.  Not impressed.",0
"I wanted breakfast that didn't require a long wait or making it myself.  I was probably off best by just sucking it up and making breakfast at home because Lantana Grille was pretty disappointing.\nWe arrived and thought the place was actually closed because there was not a single car in the parking lot and when we walked in, there was no hostess.  But we saw some people sitting so I asked if we just seat ourselves and they replied with \""""Sure!\""""-- I guess that is what I would say too if someone asked me mid breakfast at Lantana Grille what to do upon walking in.\n\nThere was a large party in the back, they mentioned that they were in town for a wedding so I am guessing they must have walked over from the Pointe Hotel.  (this explained no cars in the lot).\n\nIt is set up like a breakfast buffet, you pay $15 or $16/person and eat whatever in the buffet.  The choices are limited and not that good.  The best part was the made to order omlets and that is it.  Even the sauasage and bacon seemed to taste off.  HOW does that happen?  So the buffet had scrambled eggs (don't eat those-ick), sausage, bacon, french toast, syrup, cereal, fruit.  oh and the omlets-- best bet are the omlets. \n\nService was slow, only one gal running around for the whole place and even though not busy when we got there, there was still a huge group in the back, a small group up front and us.  Then another large group came in as we were finishing up.\n\nI just wanted to get out of there.",0
"Got there on a Sat morning at 11am, only 2 tables had customers( first clue). We wanted the breakfast buffet for $15 per person. Big dissapointment. They where already taking down the buffet items & it was only 11am (2nd clue). Went to the omlet bar and the cook looked grouchy and pissed to have to open back up. The sign said your choice of cheese but seems like the cook picks what type of cheese you want on your omlet. Even worse was the cold bacon, cold french toast, & yucky tasting cold dry pancakes. The self serve milk was room temperature. And to top it off they charged me 18% gratuity on parties of 6 or more. The whole tab was like $120.00 for the worst breakfast this summer. Only 2 things I liked about this restaurant, Samantha, our waitress and the fruit. Would definitaly NOT go back here. Theres a Mc Donalds down the street and you get the same quality of food for less than $20 for 6 people.",0
I love staying here!,1
"I stayed here last month. It's your average motel (since the doors face outside, not a hallway), and the breakfast buffet is okay (scrambled eggs, hash browns, sausage links, bacon, cereal, batter to make waffles,   and toast provided). The walls are REALLY thin, so thin that the guy snoring next door kept us awake all night. \n\nThe room was clean and equipped with a mini fridge (like the kind you'd keep in your dorm room) and microwave, although lacking a safety deposit box. If you want to keep your items safe, you have to bring your items to the front desk, make a list of what you're dropping off, and then sign. I was uncomfortable making a list, so I decided to forgo this process.\n\nFYI if you call the front desk to order you a taxi, they actually order a car service. The car is an unmarked, dark-colored Lincoln sedan. To go to the 16th Street Sports Bar down the street cost us about $10 vs $6 for an actual taxi (which we ended up taking later). We didn't want to drink and drive, so not bad, but just know that the hotels in the area do not order taxis.\n\nMy main complaint is that we didn't have housekeeping service the entire time, hence the two stars. We left for lunch from 10:30AM - 1:30PM, returned, but housekeeping never arrived. We left again at 3PM for the rest of the day, and housekeeping, upon arrival back at the room after midnight, hadn't come. I called the front desk for someone to bring towels, but since there was no one to cover the front desk, we had to go get the towels ourselves. I also wanted an extra pillow, but the front desk person couldn't leave the front desk to get a pillow out of the housekeeping room. I thought this was very strange.\n\nI guess for less than $100/night (Hilton resort down the street much more expensive), it's not too bad. I would probably stay here again for the mere fact that the location is conducing to our activities. But, if I could find another hotel close by with a similar price, I wouldn't mind staying somewhere else.",0
So we had to switch rooms 2 times before we had the room that we were supposed to have as shown online. Then!! We were told the room we were in was not pet friendly for our little dog so a third time.  I thought most of the time the pet-friendly hotels mean that all rooms are pet friendly? It was just such a hassle to keep moving and the heat did not make it any more pleasant.,0
"When you walk in the room there would be little doubt that this IS a motel, but with better-than-average decor. The bed, bathroom and all other stuff are pretty modern but the room itself is small and feels cheap. \n\nDidn't like the air conditioning. It is very powerful but at the same time noisy as heck. If you don't own a pair of ear plugs, you'd better be a deep sleeper. \n\nThe breakfast is amazing. Very delicious and a lot of variety to offer. Couldn't have enough of it. \n\nToo bad we missed social hour where free drinks are provided for everyone. \n\nOverall I'd recommended this place if you are traveling with a budget but still wanna a little spoil during your stay.",1
"I've stayed here twice before and loved it, but this time is a bust. I came back from an all day business meeting to find my room uncleaned.  I went to the front desk and they apologized and said they would send someone over.  A guy who didn't speak english showed up with towels and handed them to me.  I told him to put them in the bathroom, and he did, and even picked up the dirty wet towels from the floor. This is what i got instead of a clean room.Then the phone rang and  the manager called and said that they had a computer problem and needed to re-enter my deposit information.  He said I had a $0 balance, but asked for my name, address, and phone number.  Then he asked for the credit card number i used.  I told him I wouldn't give that to him over the phone but would come down to give it to him.  I went down to the front desk again, and I was told it is a well known scam... No computer problem.  The clerk apolgized for forgetting to tell me about it when I checked in.  During the course of my trips to the front desk I watched her check in 3 people.  She didn't tell any of them.  So if you want to rent a dirty room and be robbed, this is the place for you.",0
This a great stop n go or stop n stay for a week. I stay here whenever I work out this way and must say its not to bad. Free hot breakfast and social hour in the evening. Plus they provide a bbq first Wednesday of the month thank you for management appreciation. So if your around or passing through here give it stay and check it out for yourself.,1
"We have been to this hospital about 4-5 times in the past year with a couple different cats of ours. We have been very happy with Dr Clark in the past.  He usually goes over everything really well and doesn't try to talk you into unnecessary care. However  I just got back from an appointment today and am very disturbed by the experience.  \n\nFirst of all a little background. My boyfriend and I have been TNRing (Trap, Neuter, Return) for about 4 years. This program is very helpful for the feral cat population and only a select group of vets and clinics will even spay/neuter feral cats.  We have been using Altered Tails and although they do have their shortcomings for the most part they do a great job. \n\nWe trapped two cats on Wednesday night.  One of them turned out to be a friendly stray cat with an injury to his back leg.  Although I know AT doesn't treat  injuries we went ahead and took him in to be neutered along with the other feral cat we caught and made an appointment with Dr Clark to have him examined. Altered Tails called me after the surgery and explained that the cat had a reaction to anesthesia and he was freaking out and biting at his incision.  They put him back under, repaired the damage and put an e-collar on him. I was happy that they informed me of what happened and gave me instructions to keep a close eye on him.\n\nI knew before I even walked into Dr. Clark's office that the incision wasn't looking great but did not blame Altered Tails because I knew what had happened.  But as soon as I got there Dr Clark seemed annoyed I took the him to Altered Tails and basically called them a chop shop.  Which is very offensive considering the work they do for animals.  And it made me feel like he thought I was a bad or cheap person for taking him there.  We have 6 indoor cats and care for 2 small feral colonies. We spend a lot of our time and money caring for not only our own cats but for many lost, abandoned and feral cats each year. We spend at least 5K+ annually caring for animals so I wouldn't think anyone would consider that cheap or unkind.  But that's exactly how I was made to feel.  \n\nDr. Clark didn't even bother giving him a full exam (although I was charged for one) he took about 10 seconds and looked at his neuter incision and injured leg. He gave me an antibiotic and seemed to want to get me out of his office as quickly as possible.  I asked if he could help me put his e-collar back on because he had gotten it off in the carrier.  His reply \""""it's pretty straight forward\"""" and sent me on my way.  \n\nI'm so disappointed that I thought we had finally found a great vet and he turned out to be this way.  We will now be on the search for a new vet. I hope no one else has to experience this type of treatment when they are only trying to go out of their way to help homeless animals.",0
"I am preparing to travel with small dog and need pricing for health certificate.  I called a few places....when I called here I was told \""""no pricing over the phone\"""".  What?  Are you kidding?  Not even for the document? How about price for office visit?  NO...she told me no pricing given for ANYTHING over the phone.  I suspect it is on the same lines as a restaurant with no pricing on the menu...I can't afford it.  This was the ONLY place that could not give me a price for a simple office visit or health certificate.",0
"Dr. J and his staff are excellent. He is a great dentist who works fast, knows his business, and keeps you \n\nDr. J runs a tight ship. His interactions with his staff illustrate his attention to detail and high performance standards. He keeps meticulous records with multiple photos and x-rays to serve as both historical documentation.\n\nBottom line: Highly Recommended",1
"I found the Best Dentist in town, and it was Dr. James Jorgensen and his staff at Squaw Peak Dental. They were so friendly to me it felt like they new me forever. I don't like going to the dentist (who does) but they made me really comfortable. They have a beautiful office looking out to the mountains. Its like going to a resort with out the resort costs. On that note, they are very reasonably priced and they worked with me on the money side. \nIf you are looking for the BEST call them",1
"My wife and I had several experiences at this dentist that seemed to be motivated by his need to make money rather than our health.  Removal of teeth to install implants, veneers all across the top, expensive gum procedures.   For several years we felt very uncomfortable and pressured to spend money with the dire warning that our mouths were going to crumble in the near future.\n\nThe final straw was a call on his emergency line, only to be advised that Friday was his golf day, and Monday was when I could be seen.  I guess enough other people got implants to fund 4 day work weeks.  \n\nWould never, ever recommend this man, or his team, to anyone.  \n\nTurns out that we both have great teeth and the other dentist confirmed that not only were the procedures he recommended highly profitable, but that typically they also commit the patient to a lifetime of routine maintenance expenses to keep up the implants, veneers, etc.",0
I could not give this place a higher recommendation.  Knowledgeable and friendly staff.  The office is gorgeous with great views of the mountains.,1
"I have them such a glowing review before. \nI am really disappointed.\n\nEven though my first customor service rep was wonderful, this time I got a really rude lady named Tracy.  I just did not like the way she talked to me so much so that I just didn't even book a second trip.\n\nThere are so many competitors and the economy is not great right now.  Companies cannot afford to have the worst customer service.  I did call  Detours.  They were quite helpful.",0
"Open Road Tours nearly ruined our vacation!  We booked our Grand Canyon tour several weeks in advance, but they called to cancel LAST MINUTE (literally 5pm on the Sunday before our Monday tour).  The customer service rep cited weather issues and told us that given their 25 years of experience, there would be fog in the canyon and it really wouldn't be worth the trip up there.\n\nAfter about an hour of wallowing in dejection, we optimistically decided to just try calling around to see if any other tour companies were operating.  Every single tour company we called (we went to tripadvisor and started with the highest rated) was still operating tours to the Grand Canyon but many of them were full.  We finally managed to snag the last 2 spots with another company and there were absolutely NO visibility issues at all.  In fact, the day was extremely clear and the Grand Canyon was spectacular.\n\nOpen Road Tours was extremely unprofessional in not helping us find an alternate way to see the Grand Canyon after we expressed that it was our whole purpose in visiting Phoenix and the day we booked was the only day we could go.  Rather than call peers to secure us spots, they told us there was nothing they could do unless we wanted to book on another day (impossible since we were leaving the next day).  Given that there were absolutely no actual weather issues, and they had actually already attempted to reschedule the tour prior to the \""""weather cancellation\"""" due to insufficient bookings on Monday, the entire experience leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nPARTING THOUGHT: Why take a chance with your vacation and book with an unreliable tour company when there are so many excellent options in the area?",0
"I purchased a 2003 VW GTI for $1000 less than the \""""private party value\"""". They picked me up from the airport for free and pointed out an error I made when counting out the cash to pay for the car. (I would have paid them $500 more and never known it). I hate used car dealers and sales people in general, but I'll be buying my next car here too. 100% positive feedback on ebay is acurate when it comes to this business. I'm still driving the car and I still love it.",1
"This guy has a lot of good vehicles cheaper than most dealers and private parties however my experience with him was TERRIBLE. I live up north in Cave Creek and he had a car I really liked so I called him to setup an appointment to see it and test drive it. He was VERY reluctant to let me test drive it and VERY demanding of immediate cash (he repeated this to me about 5 times). Anyway I managed to convince him to let me test drive the car without actually handing him a large sum of cash. So I venture down 30+ minutes in Phoenix traffic and am able to look at the car but when I go to ask to test drive it.. NO! Again he was going on and on about having cash in hand up front before i can even drive the car. Now i respect why he is doing that.. however.. who on EARTH wants to pay for something without testing/using it? Maybe it's me.. but I see a vehicle, especially one that I'm going to pay $6,000 or more on an investment.\n\nSo if you are the type who loves just randomly giving money away for something without using it or verifying it suits your needs.. feel free to give this guy a call.. he has plenty of good deals.. but if your like me and want to ensure you know what your getting.. look elsewhere.",0
"I purchased a BMW in back in 06, the car was described as if it were in great condition.  This was certainly not the case, many thousands of dollars in repairs needed, basically $4,000+ for a car that will not run correctly and it's been sitting ever since then.  Seriously, beware of Arizona Wholesale Auto and Truck; the quality of their goods wasn't as advertised at all and it was many thousands of dollars wasted for a car that will not run.",0

"Usually only to \""""the trade\"""", I always wondered what was in the  unobtrusive, modern concrete building on Central Ave near Bombero's. My eyes were opened at the first Sunnyslope Art Walk when their doors were opened to the public. A stunning array of modern home decor (wall art, tables, pots, vases, etc.) items with a slightly industrial, ever so very slightly rustic flavor. Updated but not trendy, classy yet with a  little edge.  And big.  Most of the pieces are scaled for large spaces.\n\nThe decor theme is coherent in terms of colors, materials and shapes. The gallery is not like a home decor store with something of every style - the shapes, colors and look are all in the same theme. This of course means if that if you are looking for colonial, Tuscan, frontier, retro-mod, or anything outside of their scope, you won't find it here. Personally, I could do my whole house in their stuff if I had the money and ceiling height. \n\nAt the last Sunnyslope Art Walk they sold directly to the public for that evening only. We got a couple gorgeous, large planter pots to put outside our front door. We got a reasonable price and the folks who helped us were just plain nice people with whom to deal.",1
Office is pleasant and organized. Great experience with new doc - Dr. Joshua Millstein. He took the time to listen and explain things.,1
"Over the previous 2 years my wife has gone to see Dr. Shucker three times for abdominal discomfort. His first test was to have her hop up and down to rule out the appendix.... REALLY!? As she is over 50 she felt it was prudent to request a colonoscopy. He agreed and said they would contact her...nothing was done. Instead he scheduled her for what turned out to be an unnecessary mammogram at, you guessed it, a JCL facility. Finally they scheduled her after 2 more visits. The gastroenterologist found stage II colon cancer. She went back to him and reported the finding. What does his staff do? Schedule her for ANOTHER mammogram. The man is a bumbling idiot...do not place your life in his hands, you may lose it.",0
"This place is good, not great. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't give it a try. The place does a huge take-out business. And the folks that runs the place are really nice. They will deliver but it always is 40+ mins. I opt for the pick-up which has never been more than 10 mins! Outstanding. They do the basics really well and if you order your meal combo style it will come with fried rice, chow mein, and what I call 'the bag of goodness' which contains an eggroll, a crab wonton, and a fried shrimp. It's like a full sampling of all things fried! Let's face it, it is never going to be on the diet so why not just enjoy.",1
"Stay away from the Kung Pao dishes; just your normal meat and veggies with brown sauce + siracha + whole peanuts. I had to request additional siracha hot sauce and peanuts. I don't know if it was even stir fried; seemed just warmed up. Poor service too, especially since there were only 2 tables of patrons. The portion was large and the food came out quickly, which is all that is saving Bamboo from a 1 star review.",0

"I've been ordering Chinese delivery from a different local restaurant for a while now. No need to name names. I ordered tonight from Bamboo China, and it was very good. The pot stickers are as good as you will find anywhere. Everything arrived well packaged and hot. I had the General Tao's chicken. It was very tasty and not too sweet. I also had the Ma Pao Tofu in garlic sauce. Very nice. The hot and sour soup could use a little more \""""sour\"""" and a shrimp or two wouldn't hurt. That said, the black pepper level is perfect. Loved it. Will definitely be ordering again.",1
"Getting over a terrible cold and finally have an appetite for food.  This tastes delicicious to me.  Consistently great food, kind service, and fast delivery.",1
"Ugh, so slow, and not friendly, they could care less if they have your business, and the food shows it.",0
"This place has to be some of the worst Chinese food in my life.  Seriously, I am wondering if it is some kind of joke.  I ordered delivery from this restaurant, the delivery was executed by a courier service, the order took roughly one hour.  I ordered vegetarian spring rolls, and a green vegetable stir fry.  We are used to seeing spring rolls delivered in what our Asian grocery stores sells as, \""""spring roll wrappers,\"""" made from rice paper.  I did not intend to order fried, greasy mess rolls.  These were friend in either old oil or oil that was far too hot, they were significantly darkened.  Judging by the amount of residual oil, the oil was old and not up to temp.  According to the menu description of the green vegetable stir fry, \""""the name says it all.\""""  We'll, that's clearly a lie because the name didn't tell me it would be awful.  The dish as delivered was a limp pile of bok choy (wouldn't have ordered if it were only bok choy)...seriously...no scallions, onion, carrot, or any other veg besides the bok choy. The veg was limp and gross, topped in bits of garlic with absolutely no flavor.  There was a little sauce, I am not sure what it was made from and I am a very serious cook, my guess would be oil, freezer concentrate and some boxed thickener.  These were seriously not seasoned at all and my toothpaste packs a better flavor.  On the side were fried rice and low mein noodles, it's just slightly weird to get rice AND noodles, both of which were dreadful.  The rice was unseasoned and lacked vegetables, the noodles had no hint of flavor and no crispness in the veg that might give it some texture.  Nothing was seasoned or flavorful- I poured everything they sent me to try to help it out, this went badly.  There was a tempura shrimp and crab Rangoon on the side, I didn't eat it because I am a vegetarian, but they looked and smelled awful, it wouldn't surprise me if someone became ill after eating them.  The Rangoon was definitely previously frozen, and the shrimp probably made it from the freezer with no pit stops to the fryer judging by the coating.  I literally thought this might have been a joke when my fortune cookie ( generic made by the Kari-Out-Co) lacked fortunes, and I am not making that up.  \n\nThis place definitely needs a health inspection, and probably needs to be closed.  I really feel bad if locals eat here, please try Chinese food in coastal California, Houston or northeastern cities because you will easily see the difference. Overall, this was just epically bad. They don't deserve the one star, consider this the yelp equivalent of a participation trophy.",0
Still the same great service.  I reccomend the egg flower soup and the hot and sour soup for anyone with a cold and sore throat.,1
We really really tried to like this place but they just don't cut the mustard (groan). The Mongolian beef was older than Genghis Khan and tougher than his horse. The kitchen looks dirty and someone needs to tell them that using one of their dining area tables as a work desk is tacky. The search for a good Chinese restaurant in Phoenix continues.,0
"Wow, lived here for 10 years and never knew this was here.  In a Quaker building right off the 51 is one of the most Americana events you can catch.  Folk music played accoustically, by a varied group of folks.\n\nMy son loved it as did my girlfriend.  Cheap coffee for $1.00 and sodas, along with homemade baked goods round out the offering.  It really isn't a coffee house as much as a great place to hear music.\n\nVery sparse (think Quaker) but a perfect environment for the music.  If you need to chill out for a few hours, hit this place up.  There are few places in America where you will see this environment.  Everyone is welcoming and nice, we will definately return.",1
"in a non descript school house at a Quaker Church compound that's it's so easy to miss it unless you know of the place. Parking's tight with both private lot and a neighborhood street available.

It's got character, and very indie that I totally love it, and look forward to coming back to in the future. =)",1
"Love coming here to Fiddler's. it is a small small place, and it is pretty difficult to find. It is part of a compound or something. I am not sure what the whole property is, but it is odd.\n\nAnyways it is a small acoustics only venue where open mic nights are impressive, and other nights with the talent coming in are chill.\n\nAlways has a cover, but that isn't that bad since that cover goes into running the place (i am pretty sure). the usuals here are amazing musicians and you would be lucky to hear them.\n\n\nI love it when the old guys play they are amazing guitarists",1
"They charge 20% more for the same tires and even their warranties if you buy directly from the store. Go online and you'll save a couple HUNDRED dollars. Literally, it was about $25/extra per tire and $5/extra per warranty.\n\nAlso, they didn't bother to clean the inside of the wheels before sealing on the new tires. We had to constantly pump up the tire until we had time to take it back to the shop to be fixed. Which is when they admitted (and never even apologized) that it was their fault. It also took 3 hours for them to fix it...\n\nLastly, for all you clueless shoppers, they WILL put on the warranties without ASKING, DESCRIBING, or even MENTIONING it to you. I went to pay the bill and sign the paper, then looked at them and asked, \""""when were you going to tell me about this extra $100 for warranties????\""""\n\nThey had no answer, and just looked at me knowing I just caught them red handed. THAT'S when they decided to tell me about the warranty. Really? So, you charge someone for something, take their money, and THEN try to convince them it's a good deal??\n\nThe guys seemed nice, but I'm also a DIY mechanic and originally went to school to become a mechanic. I know how the business works and all the scams they run to charge people money. This franchise is no different than all the other franchise stores... \n\n\nRUN from the place unless you don't care about your money.

"I was extremely underwhelmed with Tuesday Morning. The commercial with Lauren Bacall is classy, this place is not. It remined me of a thrift store. There is nothing wrong with thrift stores, in fact I've been to many, but the prices are thrifty....not at Tuesday Morning.",0
"They always have something interesting there.  I have found several great pots and pans and other cooking things.  They also have a good selection of cookbooks.

"I like this place a lot.  They had a few items here for very reasonable prices that were actually pretty cute.  I found shower curtains here for $10 that were extremely adorable, would have been $30 at another store for the same item.  I found window treatments for my kitchen that I couldn't find anywhere else for the same reasonable price.\n\nThe staff was nice and friendly too.  They have a very wide selection of items.  I'd recommend this place to others to take a peek at for sure.",1
"BIG KIa on Bell Road is a  TOTAL RIP-Off! \nOnce you enter their premises you are attracted by all the outrageously low monthly posted on all their Kia and Hyundai vehicles. Then ,over-friendly salesmen scramble to sweet-talk you in buying it NOW. the usual low-interest rates , a mere 500 dollar down and all the hype about them assuring you 100 percent that bad credit/no credit would pose no problem and that once you sign up you get the key to your dream vehicle.which i did. and almost 30 days after i got a call from them saying there are some documents i needed to sign which they just overlooked. Lo and Behold when i got there they rudely demanded i pony up another 1500 dollars on top of my 500 dollars because my credit wasnt good enough. i countered with an additional 500 cash and they said they will get back to me after deliberating with the other members of their company. They came back and instead of acceding to my counter, they put on more demands. They now demanded i get a co-signor or else \""""you can just take a cab\"""" and go home as long as we leave the keys with them.\nI demanded that they put down their demand in writing so that everything is recorded in black and white, They refused to do so and again said in the most rudest of decorum that they would do us a favor by taking us home because there is no way we can leave the lot without either getting a co-signor or returning the key.  I asked if I could get my 500 back and they said yes but they would have to deduct a \""""sizeable\"""" amount for my using their vehicle and i would get a trickle of my 500 dollar cash back ,if at all.   I had to accede to their demand because i did load the vehicle with close to 1500 dollars of accessories like GPS, body-enhancement kits and the like and wanted to avoid the embarassment and humiliation.\nSo in the end i was able to get a co-signor and later on i found out that they intended to put additional charges to the original contract, probably sensing that my co-signor is financially \""""loaded.\""""\nI am examining my legal options. This has caused me great aggravation .   Other prospective car buyers, BEWARE!\nThe dealership is a total Let-Down! A Total Joke! Rip-Off Artists of the Highest Calibre.\nThey are just to make a quick buck. They instantaneously give away the key to your desired vehicle because they know that they can earn fat commissions if your credit goes through .And if your credit isnt in the best of shape they know they can always threaten you to get a co-signor or charge you outrageous  through-the-roof car-rental rates .\nOnce you sign the contract all signs of friendliness disppear and you are left to your own devices. The salesman i talked to admitted that his job is to \""""sales-talk\"""" and that is what he is being paid to do which means he will stop at nothing and say all those sweet-sounding lies and half-truths til you get bamboozled into signing. After that everything goes downhill. A bunch of good-for-nothing scam artists!",0
"I did not have a good experience at Big Bell Kia.  They could not locate the vehicle I wanted locally, nor could they get a VIN number for the vehicle I wanted out of state.  I did not need the actual vehicle right away, but I did need to complete the transaction right away, to ensure that I could use the Cash for Clunkers program.\n\nI was in the dealership for 4 hours on 7/26/09 working with Nate, the salesperson, and JJ the finance guy.  To be totally fair, I did test drive three models of vehicles, so take that into consideration to the time frame.\n\nInterestingly, Big Bell Kia (Which is rather small actually) initially told me that I should hurry up and buy the car because the Cash for Clunkers would end in a matter of days.  Later when they could not find the car I wanted, they changed their statement to I had \""""plenty of time.\""""   I really didn't appreciate the attempted manipulation.\n\nBig Bell Kia said that they could get the car at the Tucson Desert Kia dealership, but the dealer wouldn't call them back with the VIN.  I managed to get in touch with this dealer and was told that they did not have this vehicle. \n\nI did manage to find 2 of the specific make, model and color in the Phoenix Metro, which leads me to believe that Big Bell Kia was either being intentionally deceptive, or completely incompetent.\n\nWhen I went back into Big Bell Kia to get my deposit back, I was made to wait 30 minutes while the sales people had a pow-wow in someones office.  I watched the entire thing.  I don't know what they were talking about, but it takes one minute to run a credit card.\n\nThen I was accosted by the owner.  She started out saying that she was \""""disappointed that they didn't get my business, and what could they do to earn it back.\""""  I said have the car in the parking lot, or have a VIN to complete the transaction.\n\nAfter that the owner got REALLY NASTY.  I told her that the matter was closed and I was done with the discussion, she kept being nasty, and I had to walk away.\n\nThe cherry on the crap Sundae of Big Bell Kia was when Nate, the salesman I worked with (who was initially quite pleasant and easy to work with) called me the next morning 7/28/09 and was equally hostile with me.  \n\nNate said that he spent the day driving to get my car.  I know this is not true for a fact, because Nate told me yesterday 7/27/09, that he was still trying to locate my car.  at 2:00 PM yesterday 7/27/09, when I called him, he was still in the office.  When he called me 7/28/09 he then claimed that he missed spending a day with his kids because of me.  I told him on 7/26/09 that it was not necessary to skip a day with his kids, just to locate my vehicle, get the VIN, and complete the sale.\n\nI actually told him to spend the day with his kids, and not to worry about getting the car to Phoenix, but just to get the VIN number so that the sale could be complete.  I told him that I was willing to wait a few days for the car, if my clunker was processed.\n\nI bought the car at a different dealership, for $500 less than Big Bell Kia and in just over two hours.\n\nTake this and all other reviews with a grain of salt, there are three sides to every story, but this was my experience and I would not recommend Big Bell Kia due to the inappropriate nature of the owner and employees.",0
"I went to Big Bell Kia on 3/18/11 because I saw an internet advertisement for a good deal on a Sedona minivan. The picture on the advertisement just showed a generic picture; not the specific van that I wanted. Oh well. I got there and spoke with Bait-and-switch artist/car-salesman Tony Sol. He tried to sell me a bunch of different minivans without first checking if this one was still there. Then he checked around and found the \""""someone else had taken it home to see if they wanted to buy it.\"""" Then they dug out a handful more minivans that weren't nearly as good a deal as the one on the internet, so I left and Tony told me to call the next day to see if it was back yet.\n\nI called the next day and talked to a random guy at the dealer who \""""verified\"""" that it was still there. I called the day after that and asked Tony specifically if the vehicle was there and again it was confirmed that the vehicle was on the lot. I showed up about two hours later and Tony was busy so I went to go look for it while I waited. It wasn't anywhere to be found. When Tony finally was available we walked around and still couldn't find it. Tony suggested that it was in the service shop, which was closed on Sunday, and apparently nobody in the entire building had a key to the service shop, (which is probably a huge fire hazard, by the way.)\n\nI called back the next day and Tony keeps swearing that he'd seen it on the lot on Saturday, but still there's no sign of the vehicle.\n\nSalesman Tony Sol and his dealership are apparently a team of bait-and-switch con artists. Steer clear.",0
"Changed hands from Big Bell Road Kia to Earnhardt Kia from a Friday to a Monday with no warning. All new staff and no records from the previous owners. Had an appointment to take our new car in on the 23rd of August for some problems that Big Bell Road Kia had agreed to fix. Service had no record of our appointment, nor what was to be fixed, after some discourse they said they would take care of us, parts would be ordered, things would be scheduled and we would get a call. Two and a half weeks later and nothing has been done and the Manager is claiming they no nothing about it, and it was like we were never there on the 23rd. I am sure we are not the only people in this situation over the transition with this dealership. Now we are left with a messed up new car and no way to get it fixed, unless we go somewhere else and pay out of pocket.",0
"This is the place to go for an inexpensive pedicure.  The technicians are attentive and pleasant. They do a good job and don't skimp on any details.  They have a great selection of polishes, and usually, can fit you in easily with no appointment.  The place is large and bright, and like most quick nail shops, has no real attention to decor, but because of the size of the place, it doesn't have a dark warehouse feel.   A basic pedicure is $20 and includes a soak and a massage while your back is massaged in the spa chair. \n\nThe manicures are good too. The nail techs do a good job of applying and maintaining acrylic tips and overlay.  There are a couple of techs who will do full sculpts, but they prefer to use tips.",1
"Horrible.  The tools were shared between customers, she squirted oil on my toe nails, and immediately placed them in the water, didnt even rub the oil in, at all.  She got up three times in the middle of my leg massage to answer her cell phone or help other clients, the actual massage probably only lasted 30 seconds because she kept getting up. and to top it off, the paint on my nails arent even even!  I am going to redo them.  I got robbed.",0
"Horrible horrible horrible! Worst nail place EVER. My manicure was SOOO bad. I had a fill done & then a manicure. I was rushed, they look DISGUSTING. THEY WERE RUDE AS WELL. I asked her fix my nails and she gave me attitude? They're so unprofessional I will never recommend this place. I had to get them fixed the next day at a different place. I will never go there again. I feel bad that I even took my friend there. They got done with her nails in 10 minutes. Can you only imagine how horrible her nails look?",0
"I went in her for the first time today for a gel manicure as an early birthday present to myself and I don't often get manicures because I don't have the money to keep them looking nice. When I walked in I was greated and sat down I asked the technician if my nails were long enough for a french manicure and she said \""""absolutely! Pick any color for the tip.  Anything you want, I can do!\"""" So I picked a sparkly pink. She then pulled out the color and I told her it didn't look pink it looked way to red to which she said \""""no my darling, you will see.\"""" Then she put it on the whole nail bed, I told her I asked her for just a french with that color and she said, \""""no you want this, that lasts two weeks this lasts four!\"""" Then when it was done I took my hand out of the light and saw it was a deep, bold red. It looks great but I didn't get a single thing I asked for, I wasted not just my money but also my one birthday present. I will not be returning.",0
"I went in there, as a first time customer.  Decent gel manicure.\n\nWhen I went to pay, she claimed that she was having trouble with the machine, brought me out a garbled-looking receipt, where I couldn't make out any numbers, yet the line to sign was clear,  and that she needed to re-do my charge card.  I was having the feeling that I was going to be double-billed, and said to her, I better not be double-charged, which is exactly what happened.  I went in there with both of my receipts (the garbled one, and the 'clear' one), and told them that it had shown up on my credit card statement as a 'double billing', exactly how I thought it would be.  They asked me to provide them with a bank statement - which I did, with all the personal information blacked out.  What a pain in the butt to get a refund!!   When I presented all of that, I was told the manager wasn't in, and she was the only one that could issue me a refund.  And to come back (like I've got all the time in the world, to do that!).\n\nForget that - I called my credit card company, and they took off one of the charges!!\n\nI WILL NEVER go back there again, for the poor way that I was treated, when it was their mistake.\n\nI don't care about their spa pedicure prices or anything else.  You only have one chance to make a good 'first' impression -- major FAIL!!",0
The worse service ever She went to charge me and said the last time I was in the machine didn't work and charged me for the last time i was in. Ripped off!!!Will never go there again!!!,0
Really? Not very coupon friendly. Moved to cvs.,0
This walgreens is the closest to my place and this review is based on their pharmacy.  It is the absolute worst place to go and I seriously recommend this place to no one ever. It started Wednesday when I drop my prescription off at 9 in the morning and they told me it would be ready by 11. I never heard of any place taking 2 hours to fill a prescription I wasn't in the mood to drive around looking for place to fill it quicker so I said Ok I'll be back. I ran some errands and at 12 noon I went to go get my prescription there was 5 cars waiting outside so I went inside and there was a line of 6 people.  Never had I seen a place so packed for prescriptions so I waited and as I get to the Counter and give my name they said it would be another hour or so. I explained I had to get to work and that I was told to pick up at 11 and it was 12 and the pharmacist named Frank said he would get on top of it and it would be 10 to 15 minutes well he was getting tugged around everywhere as pharmacists usually do but as soon as he got to my script he would type for literally 20 seconds before someone said something that called for a pharmacist to explain what medications were for and have you taken this before and blah..blah.. blah after 30 minutes he finally gets me my prescription and I vowed to never go back they didn't care and probably hoped I was serious being that they have no shortage of customers. That was Wednesday mind you and today my girlfriend took our son to urgent care and he needed medicine for his ear infection and also his rash I was at work but she told me that the same thing happened to her except they forgot to fill the rash creme and told her it would be another hour she was livid because they told her 2 hours and she actually waited 3 hours before she went back because she had to get my son down for a nap being that he was fussy and tired and the same thing happened and they didn't have the prescription ready. We will NEVER return to this walgreens. I will drive an extra few miles to cvs or any other place besides walgreens. I highly recommend no one goes here but if you don't take my word for it I guarantee you will be highly disappointed.,0
"Stay far away from this pharmacy! Especially if you're a woman who has been picking up her controlled prescriptions from Walgreens for years as the so-called pharmacy manager is a super crazy religious zealot and woman hater & refused to fill my rx like I just crawled in off the streets with no prior history. Idiot. I am oh so hopeful that someone deflates his puffed up ego soon. You are not God, John Sears, you're just am ugly man with a teeny tiny penis...or so I imagine.\nP.S. Your staff is terrified of you and your tyrannical nature, I almost pity them...\n\nGuess what? CVS not only had no problems filling my scripts (I'm now a die hard convert, especially as Walgreens' inventory is always short) but they also shared their outrahed dismay with me & happily provided me with the contact info to whom I report the High & Mighty, albeit reckless & lazy, John Sears for professional misconduct. If you've had a similar experience with this hideous man, send me a note. I'm happy to share the info as he and many other Walgreens pharmacists are barely any better & also believe that they know better than my own physician...its getting scarry out there!",0
"Pharmacy is terrible. The are slow and disorganized with poor customer service. I use them rarely, but each time has been a terrible experience.",0
"For the most part, the employees at this locations' pretty cool but there is this one female employee that really made me dislike this place. I came in there one afternoon wanting to buy used blu rays and little did I know they had a 5 for 20 deal that wasn't advertised. The employee that was workin that day told me that it was 4 for 20. And for 25 bucks I could get a fifth blu ray plus other snacks. I quickly jumped on that deal. Next day I came back and saw signs of the 5 for 20 deal. I felt betrayed by that liar.",0
"just another day of going in here, except this time after i picked out the The Blu-Ray i wanted (a 2010 remake of an old 1982 film) i went and waited in a long ass line for a long ass time and after receiving my Blu-ray at the door i walked out to my car, had a feeling something wasn't right so i checked the disc, and I'll be damned, the dumb cashier gave me the 1982 (remastered bluray) version, after walking back inside i looked at the cashier who swapped the bluray i returned out for the new one, he looked at me and instantly headed for the back of the store. so i got in line (and was next in line) but between the two other cashiers who were slow (mentally and physically) i waited for a loooong time and when i got to the counter i told the lady he gave me the wrong disc and she sat there dumbfounded as to how to swap the disc out, she went and got a manger who told her to do it like any other exchange, and then after having all this time wasted she proceeded to tell me there was a sale on batteries tomorrow (Christmas day) if i come in and buy something... after wasting more of my time and the other 40 people in line she finally forked over my bluray and i was on my way.",0
No wonder blockbuster is going out of business. They arent very observant when i was needing help. they were very rude and didnt care to tell me all of the information i was looking for from them. its very dirty and not well organized.,0
"Hey, some of us still like to RENT movies, rather than buy them or watch them streamed. (Can you say compression artifacts?)\n\nIt's the closest one to me, now that my \""""local\"""" one was closed during the bankruptcy. I have no probs with this store at all. I get my movies in the mail, and I trade them in here for other ones. \n\nThey don't have a GREAT selection of obscure foreign flicks, but its pretty decent. Same for old-school horror flicks.\n\nThey also usually have a copy or two of the latest Fangoria and Rue Morgue magazines. They also carry a number of tattoo-related mags like Bound By Ink (I'm not sure why - but they do).\n\nIt's also where I usually pick up a couple of Mexican Cokes. No, whatever \""""deal of the day\"""" they are having on snack items and drink combos does NOT apply to these. Too bad.",1
"Tired of the \""""Retail Chain Box\"""" eye stores I vowed to try something new.   Crystal Optical was  terrific.\n\nThe optometrist was an older gentleman who has been in the business his whole life, it is his profession.  He is an expert and it shows.  \n\nHe exam'd me and fitted me for replacement contacts quickly and efficiently.    I have a special concern about depth perception which we discussed and agreed that we should optomize my prescription based on my concerns.  \n\nI highly recommend Crystal Optical.\nPerhaps there are cheaper places, but that wasn't what I was looking for.  I am also sure there are better selections of glasses, but all I wanted was a REALLY good exam and checkout for contacts.",1
"The Flamingo Palce has really good (non-chain) Chinese food.  I like the MuShu chicken and their orange beef.  The hot and sour soup is excellent as well.    The portions are generous and the service is prompt and efficient.\n\nThe decor is well, Chinese Restaurant! but there are tablecloths and the seating is comfortable.\n\nThey have good lunch specials for the $ but I like going for dinner as the menu has way more than the lunch items to explore.",1
"Flamingo Palace is the closest thing to East Coast Chinese food I've found. The house chicken is super tasty and they have really yummy rice.\nYes it's a little worn inside and that fish in the tank needs a bigger tank, but it's well worth a visit. Delivery was also very quick.",1
"I've spent the past year on the hunt for good chinese food near my house. Flamingo Palace, while about six miles away, is good enough and close enough.\n\nThe Hot and Sour Soup was more sour than hot - but not in a bad way. Pretty tasty. I also enjoyed the Tofu Vegetable Delight. The real standout, though, was the Flamingo Special Chicken. Loved it.\n\nOur waitress was nice, if a little off. She thanked us sheepishly every time we said that our food did, in fact, taste good. Kind of funny the first time. Weirder and weirder every time after.\n\nTime to reheat my leftovers.",1
"Highly disappointed.  After seeing the establishment for years, I finally decided to try it after reading the reviews.  I ordered the orange chicken, the Flamingo special chicken, the BBQ pork fried rice, and the fried wontons.  The Flamingo special chicken was an over-fried slice and diced chicken breast, so dry that it was almost like a greasy beef jerky.  The onion and garlic sauce served on the side tasted like a burnt soy sauce.  I had to soak the chicken in the sauce for 20 minutes to make it somewhat edible, but burnt beef jerky was not what I was hungry for.  The fried rice was ok, with nice pieces of traditional chinese BBQ pork.  The only problem was that it stuck together so much that the rice was more like a giant rice cake than fried rice.  I seems as thought the rice was pre-cooked way too long.  The fried wontons were your typical fried sheets of wonton wrapper with a sweet and sour sauce that tasted too much like ketchup.  The orange chicken was decent, with the sauce being very flavorful.  The chicken chunks were a good size, and of all the items, this was the most appetizing.  It was nice that the dishes came with white meat, and I was not charged additional for white meat like some other chinese restaurants in the area.",0
"My husband I moved into this area a little over a year ago.  Though there are plenty of restaurants (both fast food and sit down) in this neighborhood, we were hoping to find a good Chinese restaurant.  It took us almost an entire year to finally try out Flamingo Palace.  The first time we went was probably 2 months ago - since then, we've been back at least 6 times. \n\nThe flamingo chicken (their speciality) is out of this world.  The crispiness of the chicken and the sauce that is used blend so well together.  I can't go to the restaurant without ordering this dish.  We've also tried their chow fun, seafood soup, sizzling rice soup, mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, house fried rice, crab puffs, wonton soup, and I can't think of the others - we haven't left disappointed with one dish just yet.  \n\nThough this Chinese restaurant charges more than your most ma/pa restaurants, it's still a pretty good deal considering how good the food is.\n\nService is not bad at all.  They all are Chinese therefore have a very thick accent, but it's still understandable.  They are prompt and check on you often.  I am definitely a fan of this place!",1
"My Hubby & I have ordered take out from FP at least 20-30 times since we moved nearby about 2 years ago. We have yet to actually go inside, maybe 1 day, but honestly when we are craving Chinese food it's usually because we are too lazy to cook/go out so delivery is always our go to option. Plus they have free delivery! \n\nWe have ordered a variety of items from their menu but our favs are: cashew chicken (w/extra cashews), flamingo special chicken, egg fried rice, veggie chow mein, beef & broccoli & their egg rolls. You can't go wrong if you order any of them, yummy!! \n\nLove you long time FP! :)",1
"i donno if i just didn't go in on a good day, but eh. We had ordered sichuan beef and general chicken...it tasted exactly the same. Salty and not spicy at all. Fried wontons I couldn't even chew.  The Lettuce wraps were ok...little bland. Only good thing that we ate all of was the hot and sour soup. Everything else we sadly threw away.",0
"TONS-O-SHRIMP!  And not the tiny popcorn-shrimp either.   I have been getting take-out here for over a year now, and I have been pleasantly surprised.   The shrimp chow-mein is always loaded with decent sized shrimp.   Everything else on the menu is fantastic as well.   They are not at all skimpy on the proteins like some places are.   I have yet to eat in the restaurant  since I pick up the food on my way home, but  I am sure it would be a fine place to take a date.",1
"I am giving Flamingo Palace 5 stars because they have the best food and service of any Chinese restaurant I've tried in Phoenix.  I like Bamboo House and Superdragon, too, but this is by far my favorite.\n\nMy in-laws are Chinese food experts.  I never thought we could get them to like Chinese food in Phoenix as they are from New York, where good Chinese food lives.  But they love Flamingo Palace.  Every time they visit us, they ask to go there.\n\nI just had my book club there and they were so awesome!  We had heaps of food and each was better than the next.  Plus, the service was just amazing- this with 13 people in our group.  I had such a pleasant, stress-free experience.  They gladly substituted chicken for pork, and as other people have noted, their chicken is the good stuff.  Also, they are very generous with shrimp, meat, etc.\n\nPeople in my group actually ordered alcoholic drinks from their ample drink menu, which I've never really noticed before.  I'm not much of a drinker.  But everyone really enjoyed the plum wine.  It was pretty cool that they have some different things to offer than a lot of other Chinese restaurants.\n\nFor example, try the house Flamingo chicken.  It is so good.  We wiped out their szechuan chicken, it was spicy and fantastic.  I also highly recommend their pu pu platter and spicy shrimp.  Yum!",1
In my ongoing search for great Chinese food in Phoenix this place is a speed bump,0
A lot of food for the money.  Their hot and sour soup is pretty good.  They offer a lot of variety and you definitely get more than your fair share.  Try them out.,1
No flavor in their food. The service was great but the food was disappointing.,0
"Seemed better more for lunch than dinner (I've done both), however, really good food (not the standard from what one would usually expect at Chinese Food places in Phoenix) & excellent pricing considering the sheer AMOUNT of food they pile on your plate! \n\nFed me for 2 days! Good place to bring your family, quiet date environment, & for a massive meal w/o breaking the bank. \n\nI have enjoyed the egg drop soup, orange chicken, beef & brocolli, crab puffs (w/ the hot mustard is delish!), etc... \n\nSeriously, they have the best food & wonderful  service of any Chinese restaurant I've had in the Valley! AND they deliver!!!",1
"Excellent food, great service. I've been coming here for about 7 years, both dine in and take out, and have never been dissapointed. Everyone I take here (chinese friends included) are impressed with how good it is. Highly recommended",1
"When a place is done RIGHT they get 5 stars! FP is about a 4 star place, but there are several things that give them that bonus star...\n\n1. They have giant framed artwork, yes - with glass. As a photographer - I know what that costs, so anyone willing to spend $$ on glass that big gets a thumbs up.\n2. They have cool brass sculptures and other assorted Chinese decorations.\n3. They have DUCK! It's Crispy Duck, not Peking - but NOBODY in Phx has Peking Duck, right? Whatever...they have duck and it was served up nice and crisp with a hint of 5 spice. It wasn't even a problem that we were the first people in the doors at Noon (thats when they open on Sundays. Double Bonus Points.)\n4. They DO Mu Shu. Note: I didn't say they HAVE Mu Shu. The server does it old school and stuffs your pancakes right their, tableside with chopsticks. BAM. TRIPLE BONUS POINTS.\n5. They have old-school cocktails on the menu...like a Singapore Sling and Zombies. We didn't partake, but its cool that they have 'em!\n\nThe food is good, the menu offers just about every variation of everything - chicken, pork, beef, lobster, scallops...however you want them...spicy, hot/sour, cashews, almonds...whatever. \n\nPrices are pretty good (really good if you hit it weekdays for lunch special - and lunch special includes General Tso's Chicken for fans of that! That's pretty rare. If I was a Tso fan, I'd double bonus point that - but, as you can tell - I'm a duck fan: so only single bonus points there.\n\nThe hot tea was fresh and tasty. The servers are friendly, the food is quickly prepared. Even the takeout menu is really nice! Good glossy paper stock, nice graphic design, with flamingos watermarked into it. Well written, good layout. \n\nThere you have it. Five freakin stars baby, coun't em. Attention to detail matters, restauranteurs! Brings you up a star in my book, and I know it counts with other Yelpers!",1
Fantastic American Chinese! The pou pou plater is practicly a meal @ $4.50/person. we order a bowl of soup and 2 entrees and were barely able to get onto the main dish. very good. 5 stars!,1
"STILL HAPPY!!   The other day I ordered some Kung Pao shrimp and Shrimp Chow Mein for take out that was honestly dreadful.  I called the next day to complain and was asked what I wanted to do.  So the following day (two days after the original take out) I went back and got replacements for the original order.  They did not ask for a receipt, they did not ask for the original containers back,  ALL they wanted was for me to be a happy customer.  No surprise the food was delicious as always.   Every one has an off-day, it is how you react  that is what I look for.   I am honestly relieved that I can still recommend this place and have my old stand-by when I am in the mood for good Chinese food.   Good job guys!!!",1
"The food was AMAZING!!!!  I've had my share of bad Chinese but this isn't even close.  I placed my order for delivery and it arrived at the time they said and it was PIPING HOT!!!  Not lukewarm or just warm it was HOT!!\n\nI highly recommend the Flamingo Chicken.  It's a simple dish but the sauce that is served with it is amazing.  Also the House Special Chow Main is phenomenal.  It's not loaded up with a lot of filler.  It has appropriate portions of meat, veggies and noodles.  The Pork Fried Rice was little salty but with everything else it was still good.\n\nI have found my new Chinese Restaurant!!!!  After living in Seattle for over 20+ years this place can compete with the best one in Seattle.",1
"When I lived in Chicago, I felt like I was starved for good Chinese food in my neighborhood. I was close to Chinatown, but could never get organized enough to be the crowds.  But in Phoenix, I have Flamingo Palace. AND they deliver. What is it with delivery in Phoenix? When I'm lazy, I want food at my door. And I'd like to have more than pizza as an option. Anyway. I love their beef skewers and their moo shu pork. Their beef and broccoli is also yummy. I've tried lots of other things, but these are my favorite. And I think their chicken fried rice can cure the common cold.",1
"We've been coming to Flamingo Palace for years and they are always just as good as we remember. Even my kids love this place, when we give them a choice to go out anywhere Flamingo Palace is always on the list.",1
"Based on fellow yelper's ratings, we gave this place a try, it was good in parking, service, and quality of food. I think we found our new Chinese food restaurant. Thanks everyone.",1
"Our granddaughter (she's 5) wanted Chinese food on New Year's Eve. We called and ordered to pick up. We got her fried shrimp and also ordered sweet and sour pork and teriyaki chicken. The shrimp was good, sweet and sour pork ok but the teriyaki chicken was definitely NOT chicken. I have no idea WHAT the meat was and needless to say we didn't eat it. We used to like Golden Wok when they were across the street and hoped this would be as good but I don't think we will be going back.",0
The reviews on here are fake and written by the owners... The food here is not good at all and the staff are idiots. Never coming here again... Ever.,0
The crispy duck was aweful dry and all bones chopped up with little meat. The plum sauce was not helping. And the server argued with me that the crabmeat in the crab sauce was real when it was actually overpriced disgusting canned corn chowder with imitation crab. I should of listened to my fiance when he said this place was horrible. Yuck never again.,0
We decided to try this placed based on the good reviews here. It was awful. We ordered a few items from the menu for take out and we were truly disappointed.  The sauce did not come on the chicken and the chicken was EXTREMELY dry. We couldn't eat any of it.  Total waste of money.,0
"I'm sorry but this place was awful. My boyfriend and I were very hopeful reading the reviews of others before we decided to try it out. First of all, the decor is awful and in desperate need of an update... From the pepto bismol walls to the green booths it's just not good... Food wise, we had the dinner combo of sizzling rice soup, pu pu platter (which tasted just like it sounds), and the flamingo chicken for the entree... It also came with fried rice and some other small shrimp dish which turned into a disgusting gelatinous goo (see uploaded picture)... The chicken had a nasty oily flavor to it like it had been fried too long and just doused in sauce to mask the flavor. The only decent thing we had was the fried rice which the rice was over cooked but ok... Service was mediocre... Our drinks NEVER got refilled and nothing but a sorry when they noticed we didn't eat hardly any of the food. $40 bucks later we left disappointed and disgusted. Never coming here again.",0
"Our regular Chinese place was closed for the weekend, so my boyfriend, room mate and I tried Flamingo Fallace.. Literally wish I went to sleep for the night instead. First I specifically ordered cream cheese crab puffs and when I noticed I received just regular fried wontons I became annoyed. And after I tried my orange chicken I was less than happy. My boyfriend's chicken fried rice tasted as if it had been sitting for hours.. Definitely not fresh, or remotely close. My roommates sesame chicken tasted & looked the same, awful. When I brought the food back 3 asian women were waiting to confront me, heated more than I was. I started to explain that the food was terrible and i'd like a full refund. One woman became defensive and interrupted me before I could even tell her what was wrong. She would not listen to me because i \""""didn't even try the rice\"""" as if the old fried rice was about to change my mind on a $45 order of shit. I was appalled with how this woman talked to me and how she tried to make ME feel bad because I didn't like the food. Even after only eating 1/5 of my orange chicken I was sick through out the night and the next morning with diarrhea and nausea. Sorry if it's too much info but I thought I'd be honest and save you the pain and suffering of eating this terrible food. Do yourself a favor and try somewhere else. Noodles & Rice is way cheaper and a million times better. YOU ARE WELCOME!",0
"I was tempted to go with a one star on this one, but I finished SOME of my dinner.  We ordered delivery from this place tonight and it was pretty awful. The delivery driver was super nice, but it was all downhill from there. We ordered egg rolls, hot and sour soup, General Tso's chicken and vegetable chow mein. The egg rolls were fine, nothing exciting. Good crispy wrapper, not over-fried, with a flavorful inside. According to my BF the hot and sour soup was great. However, the entrees were really terrible. The General Tso had no spiciness at all and the sauce was very gelatinous. It was almost more like a hot and sour sauce, with almost a ketchup-y aftertaste. The breading was soft and mushy (which I guess is to be expected for delivery) but the chicken inside was super yucky. WAY overcooked, rubbery nuggets of chewy dried out chicken. I ate about three small bites and gave up. It was probably the worst GTC I ever had. And I've eaten a lot of bad General Tso's Chicken. The chow mein was edible but not what I would call good. It was almost flavorless. The veggies were ok and had more flavor than the noodles, but overall it was little more than something to chew and swallow, not really enjoy.  I definitely wouldn't try this place again. I guess the quest for decent Chinese food delivery continues.",0
"Anyone who rates this 4 stars is an idiot. I probably would have given it 2 stars based on the fact, that they serve the exact same generic Chinese as everyone else. But then add in the \""""cheap factor\"""". I ordered a ton of food, and your delivery driver (whom I tipped) doesn't even give a single packet of soy sauce!!! Really??? Well on the plus side, I won't throw my money down the toilet with this company again",0
"This place is really worthy of 2.5 stars, as it's passable, neither good nor bad. I ordered the General Tso's chicken dinner portion, and while the portion size was decent, both the rice and the chicken were about as bland (and overcooked) as one could get. It didn't taste \""""bad\"""" by any means, but if given the choice, I would order from some place else.",0
"Mediocre would be the apt word to describe food at Flamingo Palace. I'm baffled as to why this place has glowing reviews.  Tried the Twice Cooked Pork, Flamingo Special Chicken, Szechwan Chicken (it's Flamingo Special Chicken with a different sauce) and some Chicken Fried Rice on different occasions, and all four were average -nothing great.  In fact, I would get my money's worth at Pei Wei or Panda Express. This place should be avoided at all costs.",0
Well I tried this place for the 1st time.. and I have to say.. crab puff.. good... dumplings.. good.. eggrolls.. not so good.. \n$37 take out order including tip NOT WORTH IT.. \nI couldn't even eat the szechaun shrimp and scallops.. HORRIBLE.. I had 2 bites and I was nervous to eat the rest cause there was a funny taste.. nothing like szechaun I have ever had ever.. no veggies.. just juice and prob 10 shrimp and 6 scallops in a big container of juice. \nSooo I guess I will continue to search for a good chinese restaurant in phoenix.,0
"it's the only chinese food place near our house in the eat24 app so i wanted to try it the other nite. collectively, my husband and i ordered the pot stickers/dumplings/peking raviolis (it has so many names but it's soooo good! and a def staple for me anytime i have chinese food), wor wonton soup (everywhere does it diff so it's iffy if it's done right to my standards), house special fried rice, and general tso's chicken. \n\nwe were worried at first abt the timing of when we'd receive the delivery cuz eat24 claimed it could be up to 150 mins, but instead it was more like 30ish mins thankfully lol.. we were starving that nite, and the FP's chinese food hit the spot :) \n\nthe potstickers for sure were beyond awesome and prob one of the better versions since i moved here from boston. the wor wonton soup was pretty dang good too honestly. the house special fried rice was a tad bland tho for some reason but still worth eating. and my husband is extremely picky abt the general tso's chicken, and he was ultimately impressed w/ FP's version and would order it again. if the fried rice hadn't been a tad bland, i would've given 5 stars lol.",1
It was good! But the wonton ooOomg there was nothing inside and I called the restaurant and the lady said there was only Tiiiiiiiny tiny bits of chicken! LOL Wich is a lie cos there was none!!! \nWhy Lie?,0
Great food & great service. We ordered delivery and when it arrived half of the sauce for the chicken had spilled in the bag. The man felt so bad and kept asking if it was ok. I wasn't bothered by it and said it was fine. About 5 min later we received a call from the restaurant apologizing and said they were going to deliver our meal again. I explained it was fine and they insisted at least bringing more chicken. Shortly after the man arrived again with a fresh order of hot chicken. I was very pleased with their service & the food tasted great! Awesome experience.,1
I liked the food the two times I've eaten there. I tried to order food to go. I am only one person so I don't want to order $20.00 worth of food. Why can't I just order what I want??? I would of picked it up but they will not sell a bowl of soup smaller than  32 ounces. Why can't you just sell a half bowl??? Oh well there are a lot of other places to go.,0
egg drop is good and the jasmine tea is good too. Sesame chicken is good! It's ok here had better in NYC Chinatown,1
"We ordered takeout from Flamingo Palace last night and it wasn't very good. The Broccoli Beef smelled funny to me so I didn't try it. The Sesame Chicken was ok, but didn't stand out. Neither did the General Tso Chicken. Both fried chicken dishes were extremely soggy, but I guess that's expected for most takeout. White rice was a tad bit hard. Egg rolls were good though. It makes me a little sad to say that Panda Express has the best Chinese food in the immediate area. I wish Shangri-La would open a location on this side of town.",0
Unfortunately the woman who was taking my order over the phone was so rude I had to order from somewhere else & I was never able to try the food.,0
"This place is awesome.  I'm a total girl and lacking in bike repairing ability.  Hell, I didn't even realize that bikes need maintenance.  Whoops.  Anyhow, they've tuned up my bike and fixed several flats for me.  I suck at cleaning/oiling my chain, but Eric takes care of me.  Everyone is super nice and knowledgeable, but I'm partial to Eric.  They've also ordered a bike rack for me and helped me install it, because obviously I am no good with manual skills....  I will definitely be back when I need to purchase another bike.",1
"I called because i had a weird looking valve stem, and asked the guy who answered the phone if i could send him a picture of it from my phone. He told me no because he didnt know or trust me. I find that pretty ridiculous and bad customer service.",0
"My wife and I are experimenting with biking. The store looks like a toy store for cycling enthusiasts. They offered to do a maintenance/repair package that we would have used had we been able to fit out bikes into our car.\n\nIn the end we both came in simply to buy helmets (I'll never understand people not wearing helmets on motorcycle of bicycles especially if you are riding outside of just subdivisions). They staff never pressured us to look at new bikes. They were helpful. We got nice helmets for a reasonable price. And they didn't try and upsale the helmets either. A year from now when we are ready to commit to new bikes, we'll definitely consider coming back.",1
"I go here all the time for parts and service. Although I didn't buy my current bike from them, I will the next.\nThere's a great club associated with the shop, and club members get significant benefits.\nIf you buy your bike from them, you get free lifetime tuneups--that's a huge benefit.\nThey're nice guys and they support charity rides in the valley. \nHighly recommended.",1

"My mom took me here today for my first time. She swears by this place because they do so many cute designs by hand... and I can tell you it was the best spa pedicure I have ever gotten, NO LIE!... salt scrub, clay mask, paraffin wax, callus buff, everything you can name... she worked on me for about an hour and a half... and then she did a PLAID PAINT JOB WITH JEWELS!!!!!! so fun!!!\nI think it was worth every penny! \nAsk to see their book of hand painted designs.. or bring in an idea I'm sure they can figure it out!\nWELL WORTH IT!!",1
"This place needs a serious face lift and air freshener.\nIt's seriously run down..in a \""""we opened and never did anything else\"""" sort of way. I had tried going to 5 other nail places yesterday after work (in Scottsdale and Phoenix)because I have no time the rest of the week, and every single place was crowded, so this was my final spot before giving up. Note to self, make an appointment!\nIt was fairly empty-1 person getting a mani and 1 person getting a pedi.\nIt smelled like..well, urine. It could have been food, or the smell of their ac unit, but it smelled musky and down right stinky.\nIn my desperation, I hung out for a bit because the person did greet me very nicely..I watched while they disinfected the pedi tub so it put me at ease after watching the thorough cleaning.\nThe person I got wore gloves, used instruments from a sealed bag ..so all the cleanliness was a definite A plus.\nThe ped chairs have seen better days, but the chair massage was awesome.\nThe scrub they used on my legs was fantastic, and  I really got  a great pedicure-despite the sketchy appearance of the joint, the service and friendliness of the nail technician were a definite positive. I didn't feel rushed at all. I tend to go to places and feel like they are just desperate to get you out of the chair (well no one was waiting...so that might have been a contributing factor)!\nAnyway..hygiene practices are a definite 2 thumbs up.\nI find all AZ pedicures incredibly over priced..which is why I'm rating this as moderate.",0
DO NOT GET YOUR CAR SERVICED HERE! I came here for an oil change and tire rotation. The guy told me my cabin air filter was gone and he would replace it for half the cost. I ended up paying $100! I checked the reciept and there were so many extra charges on there it was ridiculous! I suppose I could of argued but the guys that work there are kind of scary.  I get all my service done at Camelback Toyota and they are always super nice and never try to rip me off even when I try to act dumb on purpose just to see if they will try to rip me off. I will never come back here!,0
The Art of Upselling by Jiffy Lube\n\nBUYER BEWARE! Want to learn the art of up selling. Come here.  It can never just be a regular oil change.  They do not realize the value of repeat business.

"Sports Pepper is a neighborhood sports bar with a variety of events weekly (poker tournaments, UFC Fights, DJs, etc.)  They offer up a full selection of spirits, a nice variety of food items, and a friendly staff.  The facility is clean and the prices are great.\n\nMy biggest gripe with Sports Pepper is that the food quality is very inconsistent.  The quality changes from night to night. Over the last several months, they are often out of items (the last few times it was the cottage cheese or buffalo shrimp.) \n\nLast night I ordered the fajitas and a side salad. The fajitas were excellent....very very tasty.  The side salad was HORRIBLE.  \n\nYou ask: \""""How can your ruin a side salad?\""""  \nI answer:  \""""Use old wilted and brown iceberg lettuce.\""""\n\nReally???  Were the lights out in the kitchen?  Did my server develop cataracts and not notice that nearly EVERY inch of my plate had brown wilted iceberg on it? I mean this stuff should have been thrown out LAST week.\n\nI firmly believe the cooks are Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.  Dr. Jekyll does a great job in the kitchen and I am a fan of his work.   The buffalo shrimp and fajitas are AWESOME.   But man-o-man do I hate it when Mr. Hyde is working...he forgets to keep the kitchen fully stocked and he can't even make a salad!",0
Dive does not even begin to cover how bad this place was.\n\nFirst off myself a several co-workers went here because we heard of their wing challenge.  When we walked in there was not a single other person in the place at noon.  It smelled like Clorox bleach was used on everything.  After we sat down we were greeted with the smell or sewage because there was a truck pumping out the bathrooms.  The service was very slow even though we were the only ones there.\n\nIf this wasn't enough when we asked about the wing challenge they said they don't do it anymore but they still serve the wings.  Hoping to save this terrible lunch trip we still ordered them.  It took over 20 min to get 4 orders of boneless wings out to us.  The wings were not hot at all.  They tasted like Tyson's frozen buffalo wings that had been cooked and the tossed some sliced jalapenos on them for effect.  There was not heat at all I have had mild wings at other places that are hotter.\n\nOver all I would avoid this place at all costs.  It was a dump and smelled like one and the food was terrible.  \n\nI have a challenge to any restaurant that has the guts to take it.  I want to a spicy food challenge worthy of the valley of the sun home of 120 degree temps.  Any takers?,0
"As a bit of a chili head, I have to say that I was very very excited about the atomic wing challenge here. Unfortunately, when we arrived we were informed that no such challenge existed anymore but they still have the wings. My coworkers and I excitedly ordered a round of the atomic wings and the wait began.\n\nWhile waiting for our food, the surroundings finally started to set in. I had noticed a bit of an odor when we arrived but hadn't paid it much mind. As it increased in intensity, I didn't have much of a choice anymore. Apparently, lunchtime is the ideal time of day to pump the raw sewage out and it just happened to run right through the door right in front of me. Not a good start.\n\nThe food finally arrives. This is going to be what makes it all worth it. I smell my wings and there is a little bit of noticeable tang and a some jalapenos on top. I take a bite nervously. Sort of cold. No noticeable spice. At all. Soupy wing sauce that doesn't taste very good on top of wings that I'm pretty sure just came from the grocer's freezer and found their way into Sport Pepper's microwave. Death knell.\n\nThe service wasn't bad but wasn't impressive either. Overall, between the dingy, dark decor, the overpowering smell of raw sewage, and the absolutely lackluster food, I just don't see myself ever being able to justify coming back.\n\nIt's unfortunate. I was really looking forward to this, too.",0
"Typical neighborhood sports bar.  They advertise Happy Hour \""""specials\"""" from 11am to 7pm daily.  Sadly, the \""""special\"""" is a 50cents discount off the full price.

"I recently took my Acura TSX in to get work done on it. There was some window moldings that needed to be replaced. No big deal. I called two shops and the dealer. I went with Hon-Automotive, not because they were the cheapest, but because they had very good customer service, called me back promptly and I felt comfortable with them.\n\nI was a bit disappointed though at the type of up-selling they did. Consequently, I lost trust in them, and wouldn't feel comfortable going back. \n\nOver the phone, I was quoted $428 in work done to the vehicle. I checked online, found a $40 off of $400 coupon from their website and asked to use it. When I walked in to the shop, I was told the phone price was the \""""bottom-line\"""" price and that their \""""accountants\"""" didn't like coupons. \n\nThey also recommended a transmission flush every 15,000 miles. (WTF !?). They quoted me $80 to change the cabin air filter. I asked if that required taking out the glove box. \""""Yes, that's right\"""". \n\nReality is, that's not the case. I did it myself and there are no screws, or extra tools needed to change it. It's probably the easiest thing to change on the car. Just pop off a piece of plastic and it's good to go. \n\nLong story short, I was looking for a shop I could regularly depend on to be upfront with me. I didn't find it at Hon-Amotive.",0

"BEWARE!!! So last night my girlfriend and I needed something quick to eat and decided to go here. It was terrible in the worst way. The soda system was having a problem and did not taste right. Later finding out that it was broken and was not putting syrup into the drinks. Did they tell customers, NO. Kept right on servicing everyone. The food was horrid and we both got sick later on the evening, not fun for food poisoning. We called the place the next day and said we wanted to speak to a manager (which was not there the night before) to complain. We were on hold for over 10 minutes.

I have been coming here ever since I moved to this side of town. if you are looking for fresh bread and pastries and amazing desserts go no further.

They have really neat looking desserts that taste just as good. it has a great selection of Polish food but also other European delights.

"Debated about taking my son here for some time before actually getting his hair cut..Both him and I love this place now. It's the only place he wants to get his hair cut. It's a little pricey for a childs cut, but well worth it, and they have a rewards card so we get coupons every couple of months for money off or special offers. The kids love the games and movies they can play and all of the stylists do a pretty good job. I recommend making an appointment so you don't have to wait. And we love Miss Veronica, she always gives a great haircut!",1
"Love this place! Other location on Cactus.....never again! The stylists are friendly and polite, and the place is clean!",1
I absolutely loveeee this place. My son has been getting cuts from Jessica for the past two years and not once have we been disappointed. If your child hates haircuts this is the place to go.  I even make the drive from El Mirage to come here.,1
"My 23 month old was nervous about his first hair cut, but Miss Kelly was nice and patient, and FAST. She checked in with me each step of the way to see if I wanted this or that even if he fussed. My son probably would have been fine without me there, but I really wanted to take pictures ;)",1
"We had Jessica, she was great! Our 14 month old boy's haircut turned out perfectly and she was very patient with him wiggling around! He had his first haircut at a different location and I didn't like how it turned out, but I read good reviews about this location and Jessica, so we gave it a shot. Glad we did! We'll be back!",1
"My son and I had dinner here..  Should have gone to Subway in the same plaza.  Or Panda.  Food is OK here, but I could find 100 places I'd rather eat.",0
"I went last night  to get some repair work done and this company helped me right away. They were so helpful and it is hard to find a company these days to spend the time to be helpfull. This man even did my repairs while I waited and since it only took him a short time he did not even charge me. I tried to pay him and he would not even take any money. How about that for service. I would recommend this honest repair company to everyone, SO lets all keep these kind of business people going in this economy. we need them.Thank You Thank You Electronic Repair Company on 11 st and Bell",1
"Wow, what a complete ass the owner is. Walked in with a simple power board with some bad capacitors and he refused to even look at it. Went on a 5 minute tirade about the internet and amateurs and how he's sick of helping people and wasting his savings on this business. I just backed out of his cigarette-smelling store in disbelief. Stay FAR away from this nut.",0
"Been a while since I reviewed the MVCC and a lot has happened, so an update is in order.  None of the changes are good and I'll keep it brief.\n\n-Equipment  is not being kept up and management says the budget doesn't allow for proper upkeep.\n\n-Management has changed...for the worse.  The employees here, like Amy, are generally cool, but the manager is, shall we say, not a very service-oriented individual.  Expect to be kicked out of the center 15 minutes before the advertised close time, so staff can have doors locked and be driving away at precisely close time.\n\n-Personal trainer's hours were cut back.  Pat is a great asset to the Center, but her hours were scaled back recently so it's harder to benefit from working with her.\n\nWhen asked about fixing the equipment and restoring Pat's hours, the manager said dues would have to be raised to do so.  \""""The money's just not there.\""""\n\nNow that there's a great Planet Fitness just around the corner that only charges $10/month with brand new equipment, the MVCC has become irrelevant.  \n\nThe cool \""""local gym\"""" vibe is tarnished by the staff's indifference and poorly maintained equipment.  As much as I've enjoyed using this gym and love the people who work out here, it just doesn't make sense to continue my membership. \n\nIncidentally, the Rabinos still have a Shito Kai karate dojo here and the expert instruction they offer our kids DOES bring us back.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",0
"I won't be playing here again. \n\nI randomly ended up here a couple of weeks ago with my usual hitting partner and was very disappointed with the facility. For whatever reason, this facility charges a court fee. Most Phoenix tennis courts do not. Apparently for this fee, you get the following:\n\n* Disorganized, amateurish staff\n* Dirty courts\n* Several courts did not have center straps, which meant we had to wait 30+ minutes to access a court\n* Gaps in the fencing\n* Grippy but very cracked surfaces \n* The surfaces are you standard city park surfaces, they are not the nicer, cushioned surfaces you typically see on paid courts\n* Weirdly, you have to register to play here. Never seen that before!\n* No water on/near the court\n* The staff disappears at 8 pm\n\nOn the plus  side, the courts are very well lit, and though the benches are not covered, they are spacious. Also, the center is buried within a neighborhood, which makes it both inaccessible and yet fairly quiet.\n\nThere are better courts to be had, especially for the money.",0
"I grabbed a burger/tots from this location on 12/2/11 (I typically don't eat \""""fast food\"""" but I was in a bind.)\n\nAbout 3am the following morning I was sick, I have spend the last 10 hours or so throwing up and cementing my ban on fast food.\n\nCustomer beware, nothing feel worse than food poisoning. This is not just upset stomach, it is full on horrible.",0
The staff is always super friendly and fast.,1
"The ONION RINGS we were served were SOUR!!! The MANAGER who took my order \""""managed\"""" to Screw up my order. Then the carhop brought my change back covered in spit. Every time we go to this location they add something to our order! TERRIBLE LOCATION that should be SHUT DOWN.",0
"This is my third visit and my last. The drive through is always slow. today after 5 mins waiting I honked horn and talked to the speaker. nothing. At 8 mins tried again. Then left. As I drove by I could see 5 to 8 people inside playing around not doing their jobs. so off to Wendy's across the street. They were super fast, courteous, and we're happy to be doing their jobs. So very unlike the horrid sonic that we will never return to.",0
"I'm disappointed nearly every time I go here. Store is just too small. Variety sucks, prices suck. Why does it have to be so close??",0
"Based on the quick tip I posted: \""""Check expiration dates :(\"""" You should be able to figure out why I don't love this store. \n\nIt used to be my regular grocery spot but they have really let things slide, lately. Recently, I was picking up some yogurt (the store brand bartlet pear is one of my favorite flavors!) and found most of what was on the shelf in the flavor I wanted to have expired. NOT GOOD. Especially since the nearby Fry's used to be scary but it's not any more. Not to mention there's a Fresh & Easy and an AJs across the street.\n\nCome on Safeway... don't relegate my business to watching for Coke products to be on sale!",0
"The area is sort of run down and the store looks to be in a similar state. Some Safeways are incredible, although expensive. Good thing we only needed a few items. \n\nOn a positve note, there were cart wipes which were definately required. \nIck!",0
"I'm The Duke of one of the worst Safeway's in town?\n\nThis is the closest grocery to my home.  I've been going here for years.  It serves it's purpose but it's by no means glamorous.  If you need the bare necessities this will suit you just fine, otherwise I'd go across the street to AJ's!",0
I really enjoy shopping here.  Thank you,0
"I called my favorite , friendly,  local Safeway Store tonight 8/23/14 at approx 8:PM and reported my formal complaint to the store manager on duty(who said his name was Al) that my wife who was purchasing groceries observed a white male mid to late forties,  6-6.3 ft tall dressed in a black tee shirt and black shorts standing outside the store as she entered . When she exited with her grocery cart  she was approached by this same white male who approached her \""""Panhandling \"""" by asking her for money. When he saw me pull the car up to where she was standing he quickly went into the store.  Shortly after arriving home I called the store manager and told him what we observed and reminded him that  his customers should not have to be subjected to being solicited in his parking lot when they visit his store and he agreed.  I want to compliment Al for his empathy regarding our experience. Also, I appreciated Al's apologetic tone reflecting his concern and we look forward to seeing tangible evidence of  his promise to investigate and correct what I suspect has been an ongoing problem before our next weekly visit.",0
"Terrible customer service all the time. The liquor department manager who is at the counter in the morning takes a very long time for simple transactions. She frequently takes a long time and completely ignores the next person in line, not explaining what's happening, or acknowledging them. They don't open up other registers, they are not helpful when you ask for things. I hate having to go to this store.",0
Cheap.. Hit or miss but cmon.. It's that kind of store . Always have the dog bagels that my pup has to have.. People are friendly..,1
"Prices here are crazy high for being a big lots. I'll give them that the store inside looks nice and they have many things to choose from compare to other big lots, but $15 for a pillow? When I can get the same one at Target or Walmart..Methinks not.",0
"Don't knock the Lots. Fun and funky, and tacky decor galore. Plus one time my roommate bought a whole box of beer shampoo. Sadly there was no matching beer conditioner. We also used to do something called Adventure Snacking where we'd go to Big Lots or the local dollar store and buy the weirdest edible things we could find. We're still alive, but we were pushing our luck. More seriously, though, I have picked up emergency coolers for camping trips, a decent futon frame, and a vacuum cleaner with so many bells and whistles I'm pretty sure it was from the future at Big Lots. I like my bargains to come with surprises.",1
"My wife & I stopped here today. They were not very busy. The other day (on the weekend) we went by the store while we were out & about and the parking lot was packed.\n\nI forgot how much I enjoy exploring Big Lots merchandise and looking for closeout bargains.\n\nThis place has everything from food to kitchenware, utensils, dishes, pots & pans, flatware, electronics, decorations to furniture. ALL at bargain basement prices.  \n\n******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ********************\n5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! \n4 stars - Highly Recommended.

I wouldn't mind going again. \n2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. \n1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISH",1
"I LOVE Thai food... and Pink Pepper has some very good Thai food. They are the best place in town to get traditional Thai dishes.  Everything I have ever eaten there was well prepared, fresh and consistent.  Their prices push the high end of moderate, and the service is occasionally slow depending on how well staffed they are. That said, you will always have a good meal and never any bad surprises.  It is not the place to go for new imaginative food.  When you want good Thai and are not up to trying anything new, this is a good place to go.",1
Was I there on a bad day or what?  I showed up 15 minutes after they opened and EVERY item I tried was either luke warm or cold.    They have 15+ items on the lunch buffet and I tried a bite of all of them.   Gross and bland.   I felt sick to my stomach after I left because I kept thinking how bad the food was. Yuck!,0
"Mediocre Thai food. I had the Pad kee Mao, a dish that was supposed to be wok fried in a chili and garlic sauce, but I tasted no garlic and little chili - it was asi, asi. My lunch companion thoroughly enjoyed his panang curry and was sweating up a storm from the spice.  Maybe I just ordered the wrong dish.  Oh well, it doesn't matter, with so many delicious options for Thai food in the valley, I probably won't return.",0
"My BF and I went a couple days ago for dinner. Even though it was Saturday night, the restaurant wasn't that full and we were seated fairly quickly. The decor is definitely nothing to speak of, but it was clean. The color scheme, particularly the pink and lilac napkins, was a little strange, but I guess it's supposed to go with the name.\n\nUnfortunately we were seated in an odd area in the back of the restaurant. I guess I would describe it as a corner banquette where we were sitting at a 90 degree angle instead of across from each other. There was an older couple in their 60s or so sitting at the other end of the banquette, and no one in the booths across from us. Throughout dinner the older couple were discussing breast implants, recreational drugs, and menopause the musical. Because the area we were seated in was so empty we couldn't help but overhear their conversation which made for a very unpleasant dining experience.\n\nOur server was a younger lady, I'd say late 20s/early 30s. From the moment she first came to our table things started off on the wrong foot. I was looking at the drinks menu and she made some comment about how I'm too young for that. Now I know that I look young and I don't have any problem with people saying that, but it was her tone that almost sounded like she was scolding me.\n\nAnyway, we went on to order and started off with an appetizer. I don't remember the name, but I jokingly called it a Thai quesadilla. It was chicken, peas, potatoes, and maybe some other stuff wrapped inside a flour tortilla and served with peanut dipping sauce. The tortilla was folded in half and then cut into four pieces. We both liked the taste and flavors a lot but found it very difficult to eat the middle two pieces without making a mess.\n\nFor entrees, I ordered pad see ew and my BF ordered pad thai. Both dishes were okay, but we've had better. For the pad thai, I'm used to seeing the crushed peanuts and bean sprouts come on the side for you to mix into the noodles yourself. But it wasn't served like that. For the pad see ew, this is the second Thai place I've tried in the valley and neither has done it right. First of all, I wish they'd use real Chinese broccoli instead of American broccoli, but I can overlook that. What I don't understand though is why I keep getting asked what degree of spicyness I want. In my experience, pad see ew isn't supposed to be spicy. It's supposed to be cooked with a sweet soy sauce. The noodles were good and had a nice soft texture, but the flavor that I want just wasn't there. Also I ordered it with pork and there was something off about the pork. I think it was either old or just a very poor cut of meat.\n\nNow here's why I ended up giving only two stars. By now the older couple had left and a new couple had been seated in one of the nearby boothes. Both tables had different servers who were very friendly and attentive. After we finished as much of our meals as we could, we sat with our plates untouched for 15-20 minutes and our server basically ignored us. I don't know if she forgot we were there or what. Also neither of the other two servers who kept passing by took notice that we were waiting to be boxed up and go. Finally I had to flag a server down and he went to get our server. She came and made some comment about how it looked like we were falling asleep (duh, we're tired of waiting) and then took our food to boxed up and brought back the check. Then she disappeared again for another 10 minutes before finally returning to pick up our credit card and ring us up.\n\nI'm disappointed because Pink Pepper is pretty close to our house and I was really hoping that this would become a place we could visit frequently. While I'm not outright ruling the possibility of returning, I think we'll have to try some other Thai places first.\n\nHowever, I do have to comment that I disagree with JBH J.'s review that the prices are high. I thought they were very reasonably priced.",0
"Pink Pepper has always been something I drove right past, but today it's convenient proximity to Jamba Juice (where I had a BOGO coupon) made me decide to try it out.  I thought the JJ would be a nice soothing dessert if my meal was nice and spicy. \nI enjoyed the lunch boofay very much - enough so that I had no room for my smoothie, and that is saying something if you know my love of smoothies.\n\nThe boofay area seemed small as you view it through the glass strip mall window, but once inside, it blossomed into a wide variety of dishes which were plentiful and varied: multiple rices, noodles, and soups, and several dishes each of chicken, seafood, tofu, pork, veggies.  There was a cold salad bar with regular and asian style salad.  \n\nLabeling of dishes was okay but not perfect, and I almost got a helping of deep fried calamari in creamy sauce that I thought was chicken, thank Buddha I didn't!  (yeah, I thanked Buddha, hey, we are in a Thai place)\n\nService was really friendly, start to finish, from several staff.  They have an oddly placed bar that looked well stocked for a restaurant.  Clean, yes, very much so, but uber-outdated decor.  A couple of other reviews mentioned Miami Vice, but I'm more reminded of those late 80's Nagel paintings and sneaking in a few guilty episodes of California Dreamin' (cheesy Saved By the Bell after-effect) when I would have claimed I was already much too old to still be watching.\n\nI'm calling this 3.75 Stars, but I'd easily give another star if there was some mango sticky rice available with the boofay for dessert, but I'll admit that's a lot to ask.  For a sweet bite to take some spice off the tongue, the bowl of 'fruit salad' (peach, pineapple, banana) and doughnut-hole-like, sugar-coated, fried dough balls would have to do.\n\nAnother thai restaurant I reviewed, Thouch of Thai ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/touch-of-thai-phoenix-2#hrid:XgMuRmuhpdQwbGXU9PMu5w ), seems to be North Phoenix's most popular Thai place, and it's allright, but Pink Pepper really takes the cake.\n\nThey are family owned and operated with only two locations, but they've been in Phoenix since 1983, and have earned a mass appeal since then.  This is from their website:\n\""""\nPeoples Choice - Best of Phoenix/ Best Ambience 1985\n\n10 Years of the Best Thai Food - \""""Phoenix New Times\"""" - `84, `86, `87, `89, `90, `91, `92, `93, `94, `95, `96.\n\nArizona's Best - Arizona Republic & Gazette - `91, `92, `93, `94, `95.\n\""""\n\nI'm not sure what happened in the mid-90's there, but my guess is that Pink Pepper has just stayed the same, while the popularity of thai food in general -- and the sophistication of the Phoenician palate -- has grown up around them.  With a lot more choices, Pink Pepper is not quite the novelty it must have once been.  \n\nLunch boofay six days a week though means I will be back, and I will also use it as a way to get finicky eaters I know to try something different (boofays are great for that).  I loves me a boofay.    Weekday lunch price $9.15 after tax (no drink)",1
"After a few parties left and we were the only ones in the place, we were just like the family from A Christmas Story christmas afternoon, although no one sang us a rousing chorus of \""""Deck The Harrs\"""" like they got in the movie!\n\n We got several dishes to share family style.  Menu items more than hold up the 5 stars I gave the lunch boofay. \n\nSpecial thanks to the chef who rustled up khai yat sai, a thai omelet stuffed with minced chicken and veggies that wasn't on the menu, but a member of our party ordered in near-fluent thai, surprising both me and our server.\n\nSpicy pasta with chicken, Red curry chicken, blushing Buddha (veggies in brown sauce), chicken fried rice, spring rolls, Steak & Chicken with spicy thai lemon garlic sauce, and the khai yat sai were all superb.  \n\nThai custard and fresh Mango sticky rice just sent this meal over the top, but for the portions the price was not over the top.",1
"I stopped here today for lunch after Pei Wei put me on hold. I was starving and needed food fast- plus I had a taste for something asian. \nIt seems they have changed their name to Tara Thai? At least thats what the sign seemed to say(?) \n\nI opted for the buffet to go and was impressed by all the different selections- especially of noodles. I have a thing for noodles and tried three different kinds- one of which, called simply Chicken Noodles was AH-mazing! Big thick flat noodles with hunks of chicken and bean sprouts and onions. The Pad Thai noodles were also pretty scrumptious. \n\nThe onlly thing I didn't enjoy were the eggrolls. They looked like they were straight from a La Choy freezer box. Instead of homemade and all big and bumpy they were finger sized with that weird dough that is flaky on the outside but retains all the grease inside and tastes like hot dirt. Anyway, not a big deal but I'd figured I'd mention it. Must go back for the noodles.",1
Definitely a fan of this place. It is not too often you find a Thai Buffet yet alone one that serves fairly decent tasting food. This place does both and a really good job of the later.\nThe selection is good here... My favorite is the dish with the fried fish fillet. It always hits the spot. I really like the 2 soups they have. I usually have 1 small bowl of each. The chicken with basil is good also. None of the dishes in the lunch buffet are bad but aside from the ones I mentioned earlier it's just decent. Hence the 4 stars versus 5.\n\nFor desert they have mini donuts... they taste like malisadas if your familiar with that. \n\nWait-staff is nice but I always need to tell them I need extra napkins.,1
"Let me start this by saying I am a mom of 2 young kids. Needless to say I don't have the biggest nightlife, because parenting at 6am with a hang over is just NOT worth it.  That being said I've never had cause to visit a Wendy's at 1:30am, until tonight. I've been up all night with my 6 year old son who is sick. I thought a frosty would soothe his throat and do just the trick to get him back to sleep, but all I got was a foomy version of one from them, plus shitty, cold food. If their food is going to suck at 1:30am, then don't be open that late.",0
"Went to Wendy's on 7th St. and Greenway for breakfast with my wife. They opened at 7. We were there when the doors were open. Two gentleman were ahead of us. The restaurant had approx 8 employees.we stood for five minutes, the employees totally ignored us, one of the men left. The other asked if someone could help him, a employee looked at him, didn't say a thing, turned her back and walked away! The shift Manager looked at as and said,\"""" we'll be with you in a minute\"""" Five more minutes went by and all the employees, and the shift manager still ignored us! We left! I eat at Wendy's all over the valley and generally the service is fast. Not at this location. The owners just went through a complete rebuild of the location and it looks great, but the service before the rebuild was horrible and that didn't seem to change, in fact it was the worse service I've ever had anywhere. If you are the owners of this location please do something about your poor attitudes of your employees and your management staff. Attitude is everything and it starts at the top.",0
"It looks as though Wendy's is trying to reinvent themselves...and from what I've seen so far, they're well on their way!\n\nBefore moving away from North Phoenix, my family and I had been to this particular location a handful of times. It was your typical Wendy's experience. No bells and whistles, except for the drink machine...which, by the way, appears to have several HUNDRED possible drink combinations. The decor looked like it has since I was a kid (p.s. a long time ago)...dated, to say the least.\n\nEven driving up to the Yelp Event, I barely recognize the building. From the outside, you can see that there have been MAJOR renovations done. There are sleek, dark, tinted windows all along the roof line, coupled with ceiling to floor tinted windows surrounding the new seating area.\n\nAfter checking out the Yelp table (and picking up a couple of \""""Here's The Beef\"""" t-shirts), my family and I went in.\n\nUpon passing through the second glass door, we were IMMEDIATELY lost. EVERYTHING had changed! \n\nThe first thing that caught our attention was the all new seating area immediately to the left. There are two sets of two chairs facing one another, making for a rather intimate setting. Hung on the wall is a beautiful HDTV. But, the piece de resistance for the seating area was the faux fireplace. It was absolutely beautiful!\n\nThe overall decor has been completely modernized. The old, tired booths and seats have been replaced with updated seating. On top of the dividing walls, there are beautiful glass accents. Where there used to be boring run-of-the-mill booths on the left of the dining area, there is now a gorgeous \""""Arizona Room-esque\"""" glass palace. Within this seating area, there is another, albeit smaller, HDTV hung in the corner.\n\nNow, on to the service. I know there was a Yelp event going on, and you always put on a good show for company, but the management at this location really seem to have embraced the change that Wendy's is trying to make. Three different managers were walking throughout the dining area, greeting all of the customers, and handing out coupons for free things (burgers, fries, frosties, etc.). In fact, one of the managers offered to carry our food, and escorted us through the dining area to our seats. I know it's hard to get excited about the service at a fast food restaurant, but at least there's a ray of hope after today.\n\nBased on what I saw, it looks like Wendy's is well on their way to righting the ship as far as their restaurants are concerned. I'm sure they spent a pretty penny on these upgrades. If they can keep up the great service, and ride the wave of the buzz created by these renovations, I'm sure they're going to see a FANTASTIC return on their investment!\n\nThank you to Lindsey and her team for making my first Yelp event an awesome one!",1
it's wendy's gross!!!\n\nhaha the place looks great after the update. Layout is terrible actually doesn't really work efficiently when ordering and getting food when its crowded. Just backs up all awkwardly..\n\n\nthe food is the same so guess what...i won't be back...\n\nonly yelping this because its a check in and i hate seeing things i need to review when i sign on.,0
"I went to this location in the evening about 8:00pm, and orderd two double cheeseburgers. I ordered them with nothing on it, just cheese, and two fries. So it was too go, I get home and they gave me two pattys wirh mustard on them, and get this with no buns!!!! They had mustard which I did not ask for, I said plain, and they went as far as NO BUNS!! They only gave me one fries, I ordered two. So I will be going to Burger King or Mcdonalds from now on.",0
"Would've given five stars had they not been so skimpy on their crackers. The chili was excellent as usual, but when I ran out of crackers... I went back and asked for more... you would've thought I was asking for their firstborn child...",1
"Okay, I've upped them a star because I heard through the grapevine that they've repainted and refreshed their interior. Hmmm... did someone tell them about my review?!",1
"The store near Bell and 7th St. was filthy.\nThe employee making the pizza obviously had a cold or sniffles or something.  Repeatedly touched his face and handled the food.\n\nMy slice of pizza was very good.\nBut the utensils were all soiled, the tables were dirty, windows dirty, etc.\n\nBeen to this and other Ray's pizza locations many times.",0
"I was skeptical when my cousin asked me to go to pizza....at 7th St and Bell (we live in Central Phx).  I thought she was a little nuts to drive so far for pizza.  But YUM!  The place ain't fancy.  And the wine is from a really big jug.  However, the pizza was fantastic!  Excellent crispy crust but not at all burnt.  Lots of toppings!  I took some home despite my cousin's protest that the crust wouldn't be as good.  But a few moments in the toaster oven and I had a great leftover.  \n\nI will be back!",1
Not all Ray's is the same.  This Ray's is the best pizza outside of Brooklyn.,1
"Ray's is the closest you're going to get to real NYC slices in PHX. I lived in NYC for 10 years and got addicted to large, foldable, just-sloppy-enough slices. Though I usually neglected the Ray's chains of questionable origin and quality in Manhattan in favor of other joints I liked better, finding Ray's in North Phoenix was an epiphany. If you're a New Yorker looking for a taste of home Ray's in North Phx will take you there.",1
Excellent pizza and fantastic selection of Italian food. Prices are wonderful as well.,1
"We've been eating here for almost 15 years.  5-star food, 3-star facility.\n\nIf you like a good, cheesy-gooey NY-style pizza, this is the place for you.  The pies are good enough to offset the dumpy ambience which, believe it or not, was recently painted and redecorated.  Seriously, Ray's is the gold standard by which we judge all pizza joints that we visit --- in AZ and beyond.\n\nStaff can be grumpy (also NY style! ;-)), but they warm up to the many regulars that frequent this place.  To us, when it comes to pizza, taste trumps service and ambience any day of the week!\n\nWalls are decorated with NY and AZ sports memorabilia, and behind the counter you'll see photos of the main proprietor as a young teenager working at a pie shop in Brooklyn with (presumably) his dad.  Yep, pizza runs in the family here...and you'll appreciate it at first bite!\n\nTIP: Free pitcher of soda with a whole pizza, which I think is unadvertised, so ask about it when you order.   UPDATE: Not sure this is still valid, but there is usually a Yelp special in place.\n\nThey do deliver, but only on orders of (I think) $100 or more...\n\nIncidentally, there are several Ray's Pizza shops in the Valley.  We haven't visited them all, but this one trumps (bad pun) all of the ones that we've visited in terms of awesome tasting pies.  \n\nRay's at 3rd St and Bell Rd can't be beat!",1
"Good slices here, including Sicilian.  Good deals too, the usual stuff - couple slices with soda.  Nice residual flour on the crust.  Sicilian sauce was tasty.",1
"I come here any time my wife and I are wanting some simple slices. The food is always good and cheap with the slices being huge. I usually order two forgetting just how big they are! I've read a lot of reviews complaining about the service, which I don't get. The workers aren't rude, they always get your order right, and a few times I've gone, they've tossed us some freebies. Will they win a Miss Congeniality pageant? Probably not. Great pizza at a great price? Definitely!",1
"What more can I say.  Nice staff coupled with the best New York Style pizza in town, I say that's a match made in heaven.  This restaurant deserves 6 stars!",1
Great pizza and wings but some of the employees are rude.  Lot of good pizza in the area think I will start going elsewhere,0
"I was really turned off to a Rays at a different location a year ago because they used canned mushrooms, so I was hesitant to go here when my bf suggested to go to Rays again when I told him I was craving a large slice of greasy cheese pizza.. Luckily, this location is the closest to him. \n\nWe walked in and it had a super NY feel to it. The guy who took our order was super grumpy and so was the pizza chef, but they were so entertaining and as weird as it sounds, it made the place even more authentic. While most people would complain about the rudeness and all, I happened to appreciate and so did my bf. \n\nWe got the \""""small\"""" order of garlic knots and the 2 slice and drink combos. What a great deal! The garlic knots took a while but it was definitely worth the wait. They were the best we have tried. And the marinara sauce was delicious too. The order was HUGE!! I couldn't believe that was considered a small. It can be shared by 2 or 3 people. The pizza was AMAZING! They were slices of heaven! It was exactly what I had been craving. \n\nCan't wait to go back. New York City pizza in Phoenix :)",1
"This is the BEST PIZZA I've had here in Phoenix, seriously out of this world.  The neopolitan/new york style is amazing, the cheese is nice and gooey, the crust is nice and chewy, and the bottom of the pizza is slightly crunchy.  The sauce they use is perfect, sweet but just enough. I seriously cannot say enough about how great this place is.  \n\nWhen my boyfriend called to place an order for pickup he took too long and got hung up on, with a curt \""""We're busy, your pizza will be ready in 20\"""" in true New York style.  Love it!",1
"Worse \""""Ray's\"""" I've been too! The girl told me that they raise their prices this time of year cuz of pizza. Took over 30 mins to get our food! Worst pizza ever!! It was just sauce and little but of cheese. Plus I had the coupon and so they just added $10 to the price of my food so a pizza and wings was $35 all of a sudden. Horrible food!!!",0
"ALWAYS GREAT NY PIZZA! The original Ray's and still the best! Calzones, sicilians, wings, you name it! You'll feel like you just stepped off the number 2 train and landed in NYC.",1
Great food!  Great pizza! Wings are best I've had in Phoenix by a long shot.   Smaller family like atmosphere with friendly service.  You can't go wrong with Ray's.,1
"Pizza and wings are very good.  But service is crappy.  Every guy working there was not happy, didn't make you feel valued or important as a customer.  I don't need to feel all warm and fuzzy to get good food but sure am not going to give 5 stars when the guys filling our order are glaring at us like we just killed their puppy.  Maybe someone just got a backside-chewing.  Will give them another chance and hope for  decent service and still get good food.",1
The best Brooklyn Style Pizza in Phoenix. They even have Jamaica Beef Patties. You won't be disappointed.,1
"Eating here right now. For $5 it's a steal here.  Really good. If I want pizza and I'm down here, I'll get it.",1
"Good pizza, average rest of menu. Guys that answer the phone are a little rough around the edges but you expect that at an authentic pizza joint. I recommend this place over most.",1
Great pizza! Delicious pie with a crispy crust! Reminded us of our first time eating Rays pizza in NYC!,1
"Eating here right now. Food is very good, but come hungry.  The lasagna portion is large. My husband's meatball sandwich is really good and very large. We saw this restaurant in NY and wanted to try it but ran out of time. We will definitely come back next time we are in Phoenix.",1
"Great deal, great pizza. We never dine in, always take out so can't comment on the that, but our to go experience has always been great.",1
"I moved here from eastern Pennsylvania. I was looking for east coast, New York style pizza in Phoenix. This is the first place that I found with the east coast taste I was searching for. The sauce is really good. They have a killer deal right now on yelp, 10$ for 20$. I used that on another deal the restaurant has in house: large pizza with 20 hot wings for 22$. The bill turned out to be around 12$ after combining the yelp coupon with the restaurant deal. What a steal! Enough food for 4-5 people and only 12$.  The wings were really good. We tried two flavors: honey-barbecue and hot. They were both really good. I will be frequenting this place even without the yelp coupon.",1
Best pizza ever and the staff is extremely nice I was so happy when I found this place right by my apartment!,1
"Everything is yummy ... especially the Monster Pie! They're not the friendliest guys in town, but that almost adds to the charm of this being a NY-style pizza joint.",1
I like Rays pizza not only is it NY style but it's perfectly cooked and not soggy. It's easy to order for pickup or dine in. \nOur favorite is the white pizza. Very flavorful and does not require anything else added to it. The garlic bread is also very good and I would say this is our go to place for authentic NY style. The prices are reasonable and the service is always good.\nA plus is they sell slices also and have small individual sizes as well.,1
"I have been going to this Phoenix Ray's for 10 years since I moved to town from NY.  Great pizza and hot wings - reminds me of home!  Definately the most authentic in the valley.  There are too many other places that call themselves NY style, but just don't taste like it.  All the staff is from back East too.",1
"4.5 stars! Picked up a pizza and small order of garlic knots. I have no idea how big their large is, but the small order was definitely enough for 4 people. Comes with a side of delicious marinara also. Our pizza was pepperoni and mushroom and it was great, too. The pizza crust was not soggy at all. We loved it and wouldn't have found it without yelp :)",1
"I never get any clothes dry cleaned, so this was my 1st experience at the cleaners. \n\nI bought a new king sized comforter for our bed, but it was way too big for our washer & dryer so I decided to take it to the cleaners. \n\nI believe this place is called $2.25 cleaners now, at least that's what the sign says. Any way, I decided to just do the regular laundry washing as opposed to dry cleaning, & it cost me $15. I dropped it off on a Saturday & was told it would be ready on Wednesday. \n\nOur comforter was all pretty & clean & folded nicely in a plastic bag. It's black so there were still some fuzzies on it but with black that's hard to avoid. I might get it dry cleaned next time to see if there's a major difference, it would be an extra $7 to do so.",1
"Before you go there, check their Better Business Bureau grade- its an \""""F\""""!  They already have 3 complaints that they never responded to, and I'm about to file another one!  This is a horrible excuse for a cleaners.  I went there about 5-6 times (wanting to use them because they were cheap and really close to my house), but I never got anything back that was clean or pressed enough to wear.  Now they have ruined 2 pairs of my pants and refuse to take responsibility for them.  Awful people!!!  Run the other direction!!",0
Always quick & do a great job cleaning & pressing the clothes. Prices are also very reasonable & the people are always nice & very friendly.,1
"Took a fancy $300 comforter here to get dry cleaned and although it was 1/2 the cost I've paid at other dry cleaners, it was obviously 1/2 the quality.\n\nCat threw up on the comforter and there are still remains of it after being \""""cleaned\"""". It also smells like I picked it up from a thrift store. I've had this cleaned twice before and never had an issue. \n\nThe guy at the counter was very fast and got me in and out super quick, but if they opened up the comforter to look at it, they would have easily seen the stain. I shouldn't even call it a stain because it's not discolored, there are just dried up remains still on the blanket. I scratched at it lightly with my fingernail and it was coming off easily. \n\nQuick service, poor quality. Will not be back.",0
"Fast. Friendly. Great value. Excellent quality. I've been going here for years. They do a great job, it's not expensive, and the turn-around time is fast. The only thing that would make it better is if they had a drive-thru!\n\nI'm sure that they are not able to get out every single stain. The reviewers who seem to think this is unacceptable clearly haven't been around around too long. By the way, regarding the post about complaints with the BBB, who cares? The BBB deploys mafia-like tactics to pad their bottom line. It's useless, irrelevant, and not worth a business-owner's time.",1
"They are lucky leaving 0 stars is not an option. This place ruined my DRY cleaning. I need to emphasize DRY because they washed the items i brought to them.. not only did they wash my items.. which are now color stained and washed out in areas.. they also creased (pic attached) items that clearly have a NO CREASE tag... with sooooooo much starch the pant legs were literally glued together. I have never had my things ruined or had such a piss poor job done on my dry cleaning before. Im a little shocked still.. when people drop things off and entrust a business with their personal items, to do a job that is ... oh i dont know... on the huge neon sign above their door!!! I believe i should be able to trust them to properly do the things theyre advertising for... .... ffs.   If you value your clothes... go somewhere else.",0
"Lets make this easy   Just moved here  brought them 7 pairs of pants for dry-cleaning  6 came back worse than when I dropped them off   Took them back   Picked up a couple days later, same condition   Decided it wasnt worth a third try so I ironed myself  \nMoving on to another local cleaners for my $30/week in dry cleaning",0
"If I could give a 0 star, they'd own it.. I have nothing.. Not one positive to say about this bank. I wanted a local bank because most of my money is in USAA which used to be hard to make deposits to because they are based in San Antonio. BofA has fees upon fees.. Long lines at any lunch hour... Waits on phone , awful customer service.. Oh and the kicker.. I deposited a trust fund check.. From Vanguard!! They wouldn't let me have it for 10-14 days.. Despite that Vanguard had cleared the check with them.. I'm guaranteeing BofA made interest off of my $7k! Don't get me started on what they have done to our housing market.. Ahh.. Thank God I can bank with USAA..",0
"It's not the people, but how the bank itself runs that pisses me off. The fees, the red tape, the general BS I seem to have problems with these buttheads. I have three (3) business accounts here and they tell me time \n-and-again that I need to open a personal account to cash my paycheck with them. I own my business, the check is from them BofA, it's made out to me. F***ers give me my money, it's mine NOT yours.",0
"I needed a backup, for emergencies only sort of account, somewhere I could put money and forget about it until the day rolled around I needed it. It was a mistake getting it from BOA. \nI need to take some of the blame though, I am the one who opened a BOA account and didn't realize I needed to have paperless billing or I would be charged $9 A MONTH. After many months have passed I finally checked my statement to realize I didn't have enough in savings (the majority was all in checking) which charged me an additional $5, so for months I have been being charged $14. \nI'm willing to take responsibility for that. But, I do think it's pretty crappy to charge someone that much a month in fees!\n\nI stopped in this branch yesterday to close the account and was surprised how little they seemed to care. We exchanged greetings and chatted about our Halloween and what each of us were doing. I told him I needed to close both my savings and checking account, he said OK and printed off the paperwork no questions asked. Really? No Questions? This bothered me more than the fees, he never asked me why I'm closing the account, never asked if there was anything he could do to keep me a member, seemed pretty happy to let me go. I've heard this from other people, BOA just doesn't care about their members. If he would have asked why I was leaving and asked to look at my account to see how we could eliminate fees from that point forward I may have considered staying a member, but to no avail, he just didn't care.",0
"I lived in this apartment complex for the past year. It comes with all of the bells an whistles. This behemoth overshadows the sketchy neighborhood it resides in. Don't get me wrong, I never felt endangered, but you place an expensive jewel in the middle of dirt and it will get dirty.\n\nFacility-wise this place is enviable. Huge pool with sandy beach. Large pool/grilling facilities. Volleyball court. Nice, cozy gym. \n\nThe apartment is ok by my standards. It is basic and ok for the price I suppose. 745 sq. ft. for $800 a month. I was never a fan of my neighbors, and this is where the dirt from the outside starts to seep in. No one was ever friendly towards me. I had loud, obnoxious residents around me. It was, at some points, insufferable. \n\nI even had an instance this past spring when the trees and flowers blossomed and grew. They grew right over my stairwell. When I asked if they could send someone to trim it back, they acted like they put it down. It took 3 weeks before anything happened. That is just terrible service. \n\nGranted it is not all bad. I wouldn't exactly recommend it, but I am picky. So now you know.",0
"I lived her for over two years and there are things that I liked about the place and even more things I disliked about it. \n\nGood: \n-Nice looking place near the front of the complex\n-The apartment layout 2bd was nice and was good size over 1200 sqft \n-Maintenance response is pretty good\n\nBad: \n-The complex really only keep the front of the building clean near the pool area. This is done because all potential renters are only shown the front of the complex. The back of the building by the dog park has dog feces all over the place which smells in the summer and the grill always seem to be broken and are not kept clean. \n\n-The average water bill that I paid at the complex averaged 100.00 per month with our highest being over 130.00. When I asked management on several occasions about the cost of water (My average water bill in my home was 80.00 and that was with an above ground pool) I was told it was likely a leak. The complex sent maintenance over and they stated it was a toilet leak on two different occasions. Which I never bought but what could I do. My point of this is that you are really paying for the pool and for the landscaping which is a lot of grass that is watered continuously. \n\n-I had read reviews that when you leave the complex that they will nickel and dime you for everything and you will always leave owing money. To counter this I had maintenance fix anything that I deemed could be an extra cost when I moved. About a month after I left, I was called by Mark Taylor and told I owed them over 300.00. I said that when I left I paid all of the rent that I owed plus the water bill and they  said that I owed 6 days of extra rent (I told complex I was moving out on the 20th and my lease went until the 26 and when entered into the system I paid the website through te 20th. I was not aware of this at the time I paid the bill) and I was being charged an extra 150.00 for carpet cleaning. I advised the person at Mark Taylor that in the two years I lived there that I never had the carpet cleaned and that I believed was normal wear and tear. They sent me pictures of the carpet (before it was steam cleaned) and stated that there was dog stains throughout the apartment. Which I know to be a lie as my dog is potty trained and never had an accident. My wife is also a stay at home mom and walked him frequently. I finally did pay the rent as that was my contractual obligation but I refused to pay for the carpet cleaning. \n\n-Lastly, the neighborhood itself is not very nice. There are a lot of homeless people in the area and it was starting to feel unsafe at night.",0

"I have worked with CR for many years now. Through two owners and many many property mangers assigned to my properties. I would use MUCH MUCH HARSHER words to describe the experience but suffice it to say I do NOT reccomend working with them. I will let you draw your own conclusions by explaining my experience. CR charges me to fill my properties. The tenants have been bad. Really bad. They have caused many repairs,.monthly. I do not mean fix a backed up toilet. I mean one month a $1000 garage door, the next month every water carrying device in the house is in need, bathroom, sink, kitchen, floors, door handles etc. then more the next month etc..The tenants are not of great quality so they also do not pay rent on time, so CR takes the revenue as late charges which they take before your rent is paid, pocket about half, collect a % on top of the late fees, rent and all, and what is left they pay their repair persons hired to do repairs... Then ask me to replenish my account. We received aprox 50% or less income to us. Yes more than half of the rent dissappeared. I have to say it starts to look very fishy the way they manage properties. I advise you to steer CLEAR of this company. I have lost at least 10k a year on rent since they managed properties for various reasons. If anyone else has these experiences with them please let me know or post it asap.",0

I disputed the charges and reminded them of an overpayment that was due to me from the previous month. I also started demanding itemized bills. Only after I furnished proof of the check that they had cashed did they give me the $300.00 back but maintained their bullsh_t claim of $1,300.00 in damages. \n\nSo I ended up with a net bill of $1,000.00. I still wonder how they racked my bill up so perfectly in their favor with the intention of keeping every red cent. I mean really, my ENTIRE deposit?

As I was putting Leo in his carrier in the car I noticed blood all over the seats, my clothes, body, and a large pile of blood in his carrier.  I rushed Leo back in the NPSNC and let the woman know he was bleeding profusely.  She waved me off with, \""""That's normal, just make sure you don't set him on white carpet.\"""" \n\nI was shocked and terrified as I brought little Leo home to my boyfriend Easton.  We frantically rushed him to the 1st Pet Animal Hospital on Union and 7th avenue.  They gasped as they pulled Leo out of his crate and assured us we did the right thing.   They let us know we were lucky we brought him in before he lost too much blood.  After waiting anxiously for almost two hours we were told they would keep him overnight as long as we paid at least a deposit of $400.  Knowing our baby boy was in good hands was worth cleaning out our bank account.\n\nBefore we left for the night, one of the nurses discretely let us know this is not the first time she's seen this scenario from the same place.  She also informed us about Arizona Veterinary Medical Association which is the watch dog of all Veterinarians.  \n\nWe stayed up all night praying, crying and talking about what our solutions were.  We were determined to make NPSNC reimburse us for the emergency bill as well as do everything in our power to make sure this doesn't happen to someone else's animal.\n\nThis morning Easton and I took the day off work and sat down to contact NPSNC.  Although we were emotionally and physically exhausted, we kept calm while trying to speak to someone above the girl at the front desk.  Finally after calling multiple times we spoke with Office Manager/Head Technician Kate Smith Southard.  She told us that she did the surgery herself and nothing was wrong with Leo. She also said that the emergency vet only wants money and there was really nothing wrong and refused to reimburse us.  When we tried to get Owner/Veterinarian Arden Anderson we were refused.  At first we were told he would be on vacation for a few days, and then when we asked for an appointment with Mr. Anderson we were told he wouldn't be back for months because he is out of the country.\nDespite what seems like a dead end we are determined and will never stop until we get this resolved.",0
If there were an option for 0 stars that's what I'd choose. This place should be shut down. Years ago I made the mistake of taking my puppy Lucy to get spayed here and from the get go the staff was very rude and acted as if they were put out answering any questions I had at all. Later that day I picked Lucy up and her incision looked like a giant sloppy wound you would see in a horror movie. When I asked about it they assured me it was fine and would not send home any pain meds for her. The next few days Lucy was in extreme pain wailing and crying all night which shouldn't be the case. I thought that experience was bad but nothing compared to my brother's. Just yesterday my brother took his puppy Leo here to get neutered when they picked Leo up he was bleeding everywhere. When they brought it to the vets attention they assured them that it's normal to stop worrying. So they took him home. Well the bleeding wasn't normal he kept bleeding profusely to the point that his scrotum was completly filled up with blood and swollen up huge. This is the point they took him to the emeegency pet clinic where they gasped and said it is definatly not normal. They kept Leo overnight and good thing. They said if he wasn't brought in there was a good chance he would have bled out overnight. They also informed him that they get quite a few emergencies that come in after going to this hack shop North Phoenix Spay and Neuter Clinic. So take it from me if you can avoid this place at all cost if your pet means anything to you. I will never step foot in this place again.,0
Im a fan! \nJosh in parts was very knowledgeable and cool to speak with.\nGood selection of parts and a nice showroom.\nI would give them a 5 star but have not used their service yet on my bike but I will tell you I feel very confident it will be the same great experience! \nGood job guys finally found a bike shop I can trust!,1
"All of your lamp repair needs!  I recently started using them to rewire lamps and fixtures.  If there are ANY odd parts you can't find for your lamps this is THE place you will find them.  Place is loaded loaded with older lamp parts!  They are a little growly at times, but their work is wonderful.  Look for the weird wizard out front!",1
"So grateful I found this place. Definitely worth the drive from the southeast valley. \nTheir staff is knowledgeable and helpful. The kind of friendly you expect in a small town, not in metro Phoenix. \nTheir prices are reasonable. They not only carried the unusual wiring I needed, but suggested that I bring my fixture along so they could make sure that really was what I needed. \nI would suggest this place to anyone looking for any lighting repair or parts. Even if you can get what you need at the big box store, it's a much better experience to go here. Trust me.",1
I highly recommend this shop! They went out of their way to fix my unique lamp that required extensive repairs & still kept it within my budget. They are very honest & have integrity in their work. A very pleasant find. I can't say enough good things about them!,1
This place used to be a favorite but the quality continues to deteriorate.  It appears there are new owners.  \n\nThe buffet items are overly greasy and spiced oddly.\n\nLast time I was in not one staff person there even said a word to us.  It was weird!,0
"Edit: New ownership noticed 2008. \n\nTasty Indian cuisine with a British influence. Pub side has mostly British ales and are served in traditional, Imperial pint glasses.\n\nFood is average and in line with most Indian Cuisine in the Phoenix area. Chana Masala with garlic naan is an exceptional combination at this location. Appetizers are high quality as well. \n\nPrices/portions are on par for most restaurants.\n\nService is about average as well - sometimes great, sometimes good, and sometimes poor.",0
"Stopped into this mid-sized place for the lunch buffet today.  It's a little glitzy inside but ok, & has all glass covered tables that were mostly set up for at least four people.  I missed seeing booths, my preference, but did manage to find just one comfortable spot in the place, at a smaller, out-of-the-way table.  It's a good thing I got there at opening time!\n\nAmong the salad items, the cole slaw was tasty, & the server lady brought me naan bread that didn't have garlic or greens on it, but it was buttery, piping hot, & cooked just right.  Otherwise there was nothing special about the place.  Everything tasted ok, but a lot of the dishes were way too soupy.\n\n$8.95, Open 11:30 AM, Full Bar.",0
"i used to eat at this place every month back in 2005-2007, since then they have completely gone down hill. really slow service and the quality has faded, i feel badly i hope they can fix that soon.",0
Just stopped for lunch before driving off. Food was below average. They had about 3 vegetable dishes and 3 chicken dishes. Nothing great .. Probably won't ever go back.,0
"The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars instead of 1 is their naan bread was fantastic.\n\nI'm hungry and craving some Indian food, so I stop in.  I'd eaten here a few years ago and thought it was pretty good but not great.  So I go in and the lady at the counter who is none too welcoming tells me to go sit \""""whereever\"""".  So I do, assuming she will bring me some water and then I'll go to the buffet.  But I'm sitting there for a while, about to just go to the buffet when she comes over and rudely says \""""You can go get a plate.\""""  I'm wondering if I've offended her in some way but as I haven't really said or done anything, I figure not.  As I go to fill up my plate, I (and the entire restaurant) hear her yelling into the kitchen and the tone was not friendly.  Someone yells back, also not in friendly or joking tones.\n\nNow, I look at the items in the buffet, and it looks pretty sparse.  Granted, the place hadn't just opened, it was after 1.  But still.  Rice, a chicken korma, a spinach dish, a vegetarian dish, maybe two sad pieces of tandoori chicken, no onions or lemon with in.  But, I figure, maybe they had a lunch rush and maybe I'm spoiled into having a larger variety.  I check out the \""""salad\"""" part of the buffet, pretty standard stuff.  The food was very bland, even for me who doesn't like really spicy.  All the food seemed to have a similar flavor to it.  Then I tasted one of the relishes- bad idea- I had to spit it out it was so noxious.  I'm not even sure what it was,maybe something with olives (my husband is constantly amazed that I will eat things I don't recognize) but it was bad, bad, bad!  Inedible.  Heinous.\n\nAt this point, I'm really wishing the waitress/greeter would bring me the water I still haven't received so I can get this awful taste out of my mouth.  She comes over and I politely ask her for water and if the buffet comes with naan bread which I see other customers eating.  She says yes and stomps away.  She brings me water finally and a few minutes LATER I see her order some naan bread from the kitchen.  So I'm done with my meal and eventually she brings the bread, which, I will say right now, was outrageously good.  So good I'm considering going back even though the meal itself was pretty terrible and the service worse.  I go back to the buffet, convinced I've maybe missed something- like the really great milky tea or rice pudding some Indian buffets serve, but no.  I'm out of luck.  To top it off, I go over to pay, and I compliment the lady on the naan bread, to which she says nothing but tells me to wait there.  I wait while she and several others clean up the entire buffet!  After they are done, she comes over and does me the favor of letting me pay.  \n\nI couldn't really believe this experience, it was almost comical.  Like one of those restaurants where it's their \""""thing\"""" to be rude to the patrons....well, I  will probably not be going back here even for the naan.",0
2 for awesome service & the best naan ... The rest.. Hands down to a zero ... & I feel bad rating it so low... But I've had wonderful Indian food... Outside of the mother land...& this is just horrible... :-(,0
"Don't go! On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give the food a 3, service 3 and ambiance 5. Prices are high and serving size small. \n\nThe tandoori chicken is the worst I have eaten in AZ. For a moment there I was envying my dog's chew stick. Really, it sucked.\n\nWonder how they survive.",0
I made the mistake of going here once for lunch. Blah. The food wasn't good and the service was bad. They seemed to hate me for some reason.,0
"Pros: Ummm, let me get back to ya \n\nCons: \n1. Currently undergoing some kind of exterior construction \n2. Food had spices in it, but nothing that made any dish \""""pop\"""" \n3. Bathroom is filthy \n4. Service was unfriendly \n5. Felt ill afterward \n\nDon't waste your time here, there are lots of awesome places to eat in Phoenix.",0
"Rubbery, nearly raw, white outside, pink inside chicken in two different buffet dishes. \nI hope they looked at my plate to try to figure out why i simply got up and left, but in my opinion, if you are incompetent enough to put an entire serving tray of undercooked poultry out on a lukewarm steamtable, then anything I can try to explain about what was wrong, will likely fall on deaf ears anyway.",0
"The food was ok at best.   Too much salt added to all the dishes we had.  I really liked the vegetable samosa.  The saag paneer was ok, but the matar paneer was horrible.  the chicken masala was ok as well.\n\nThe portions were pretty small for the price you pay.   The restaurant was big, service was slow, and it wasn't that busy either.\n\nI don't expect to eating here again.",0
I think this place closed.,0
"I can't say enough about Rob and the team at Smart Automotive.  When you find a mechanic you can trust, you hold on tight, and in Rob, I have that.  I have several friends who take their cars to Smart and every once in a while we will honestly go on and on about how much we love taking our cars there.  It makes it a lot easier to pay for repairs when you know you're not getting ripped off.",1
"I'm writing this review after not going to this place for a while.  But I thought about this place today because I just had a third mechanic today tell me that the catalytic converter was a total hack job.  It was an after market converter and not put on well at all.  And it wasn't really cheap where it makes sense that it was a horrible job.  I'd pass on this place, I moved on a while ago.",0
"I cannot say enough good things about the team at Smart Auto - and I must admit; I'm embarrassed I haven't written a review yet even after years of fantastic service. First off, this is a local, family owned business and supporting the underdog has always been a priority to me. I remember my first visit to Smart Auto almost ten years ago when I took my very first car in and learned that the transmission was shot. As any 17 year old slaving away making only $5.15 an hour would do, I cried my eyes out at this news while Rob (owner) explained what would need to be done. He referred me to a transmission shop just down the street and made sure I was taken care of. Ever since this experience, I have been 100% paranoid about every noise, unusual vibration, etc. my vehicle makes, and Smart Auto has always been there to answer my questions and provide some \""""auto Zen\"""" and peace of mind. I can't even list how many times I've brought my car in to Rob, worried that it would explode, and was reassured by his clear and concise explanation of exactly what was happening and IF anything needed to be done. The \""""IF\"""" is emphasized for a reason - this guy does NOT participate in bullsh**, upselling or generally draining of one's bank account just for fun. He's an honest guy and does fantastic work. I've even called him from Hawaii (where I now live) with \""""super urgent\"""" (my words, not his) questions regarding a wheel bearing - this guy deserves an award just for dealing with me. I would recommend him to absolutely anyone looking for a top notch, grade A mechanic.",1
"2 stars from the vegan perspective. Why? Because they don't have much of any vegan food.\n\n1) The pizza sauce contains cheese\n2) The marinara sauce contains cheese\n3) Their margarine contains whey\n4) Their pasta contains egg or milk\n\nSo PLEASE start offering a vegan entr\u00e9e and some vegan marinara sauce SoNY! Maybe some whole wheat pasta too?\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to complement and praise our amazing server Andrea. She is so awesome! She happily took the time to check on all of the items and dish ingredients for us to find out if they were vegan (or most often, not). Amazing customer service!\n\nWe wound up eating the following:\nCustom made passion bread with no garlic butter or cheese. We had it brushed with olive oil and added some oregano. We then made an olive oil + balsamic + oregano dip.\nA salad with their Italian dressing.\nA small pizza with no cheese, no sauce, veggies + pineapple & olive oil added as a base.\n\nTheir passion bread (made from pizza crust) is super delicious but it really sucked that we couldn't dip in some marinara.",0
"Here is my summary of Streets of NY:\n\n1) Greek salad-4 stars\n2) Italian wedding soup-4 stars \n3) Pizza-1 star.\n\n\nI've been to NY and this is not NY style pizza. Regardless of that, it simply isn't good. It reminded me Pizza Hut. Do not order the soup if you are on a low sodium diet. The delivery was prompt which was good....I guess.",0
"We've been going to SONY for probably ten to twelve years,  and i don't think i've had a bad pizza at this place. We get the lunch special sometimes or go there for a full pizza at dinner. I've never tried the sammiches or other pasta, although they look tasty when they pass by our table enroute to some other customer. I like that they all have patios that you can enjoy when the weather is nice.",1
"So ..according to The Sewers of New York, this was 75.00 dollars worth of food?!?! The food was edible and the service was sub par at best, and to top it off when we advised them of our displeasure, they didn't offer to make it right. Thank goodness we still have several days of our family reunion left!",0
I've been to other ones and the food is decent I went in here and it took them 15 min to even say hello after I sat at a table. I left and don't want to ever come back.,0
"My wife and I have been driving by Joey's for two years and last Saturday evening we were in the mood to try someplace new.  I'm always up for trying a new restaurant.  The Adventure! The Curiosity! The excitement!  Oh, lets not get to carried away here.  I'm a pretty decent self-taught chef and my standard is simple: The food had better be at least as good as I can prepare at home.\n\nI had the Rigatoni with smoked chicken in a parmesan cream sauce.  This is a dish that's hard to screw up, and they didn't.  It was fine. But 15 bucks?  We're talking about a few cents worth of pasta, some cream and parmesan, and about a quarter of a chicken breast grilled and tossed in. Easy. Tasty. Not worth $15 hard-earned money. We're talking the same price as Macaroni Grill's Chicken Scaloppine and there is a world of difference between what went in to the two dishes.\n\nMy wife had the lasagna. She ate a small portion and asked for a cary-out container.  As we were walking to the car later she said, \""""The lasagna was terrible\"""".  So why did she want to take it home?  \""""I dunno\"""".  At least that gave our son a chance to render a second opinion on it.  Our son, the Army Infantry Fire Team Leader. Chows down MRE's like they are gourmet.  His verdict?  \""""Disgusting\""""\n\nIf you are going to spend fifty bucks on a meal you deserve better than this.",0
"I enjoy Joeys, esp. if you are looking for some place quiet. \nWhenever I have been in there my guests and I are the only ones in the place. I actually spent my 21st birthday dinner here. The owner is really nice and remembers my name each time I'm there, in fact he is almost always the person who takes my order. \nI do agree that the prices should come down a bit.. \nThe service will keep me coming back. I don't really get the creepy vibe that the other reviewers got but then again I didn't take the vegetarian house as a cult either..\nIts excellent for dates you actually want to talk to, its been a cure for the restaurants that I can't even hear my guest speak.\nI must say, if you do go and enjoy liquor try the lemon cello. The owner makes it from scratch and its even better when you dip cannolis in it.",1
"My hubby and I tried Joey's on a Friday night for the first time around 8:30 for dinner. It seems like a fancy misfit in the midst of the Safeway shopping center, and I was never sure just how I should be dressed before I walked inside. On this particular night we saw a small group walking into the restaurant dressed as though they were headed for the swap meet, so we took that as a sign that we'd have no trouble being seated in our flip flops and tees, though I still felt a bit underdressed once inside. Short and to the point:\n\nFriendly staff\nGood service\nAuthentic recipes\nReasonably priced\nDress up or dress down\nVery quiet - where are all of the other patrons?\nBaked Ziti (enough for two and oh so delicious) comes with a side salad for $13.00\nGreat Tiramisu a block from my house? Huzzah!\nRelaxed, comfortable, fresh flowers and candlelight on the tables equals nice ambiance.\nIncredibly attentive, because there's hardly anyone else there? No, really, why aren't people flocking to this place?\nMusic volume is a little low for my taste...and 80's was it? Italiano would be lovely. That's why I just can't give Joey's a final star.\n\nBon appetit!",1
"I have recently reconsidered trying this place again which led me here after looking at their menu on their website, and I remembered why I have lived just a block away for seven years and have only been once. Way over-priced!!!! This place is trying to be something it is not. I'm sorry but it is more than olive garden and someone mentioned macaroni grill and pales in comparison. There is a reason that almost every single review on here mentions that they were either the only patrons in the place or close to it. I walked into this place seven years ago and looked at their menu prices and instead of just walking out, I ordered one kid's meal for my daughter-some spagetti noodles- It was subpar at best. And seven dollars for mac-n-cheese, that is outrageous! I have been many places and have ordered many kid's mac-n-cheese (it's all my daughter wants) and NEVER has it been seven dollars! It really is a shame, I drive passed this place every day going to Safeway and whatnot, and am always looking for a place to sit down with family and enjoy good food, without breaking the bank. The prices should reflect the food, the location, the atmosphere and decor, and the service. If it did, there would be people there eating, rather than a ghost town. Honestly, I am surprised it is still in business.",0
Had lunch here a couple of days ago.  We arrived a few minutes after 12 on a Wednesday and it was a morgue.  The staff was sitting around watching tv and I felt like we interrupted them.  It's an ok place and I guess my beef with this place is that it's like amateur hour.  I get the feeling that they opened this place with no prior restaurant knowledge just that someone liked their chicken parm and were told they ought to open a restaurant.  That's a great start and probably how many mom and pop places start but it is clear that they need some restaurateur guidance.\n\nThe food chicken parm was decent but my friend said that their sausage peppers tasted like it was made the day before.\n\nAnother reviewer described the decor as being in their grandparents house.  That's spot on.,0
"Holy shit.\n\nWhere do I begin? \n\nFirst off, \""""Joey's California Bistro Italian Restaurant\""""? Isn't that like, \""""Mandy's Apparel Shop Store for Clothes\""""?\n\nThe place was mostly empty, save for terrible, dated decor and a smattering of rather lively and vivacious flies. A waiter was screaming at a customer from the other side of the restaurant. Even when I realized they were screaming sports-oriented things, it still wasn't normal. As our waiter wheezed the specials of the day to us, we feared he was literally about to die in the middle of the word \""""stuffed\"""".\n\nOur salads consisted of romaine, three pieces of cucumber, and one tomato, cut in half. The bleu cheese dressing contained no actual cheese. I ordered tea with lemon and honey, but the honey was a \""""blend\"""" made out of mostly high fructose rice syrup... is honey too rare a commodity to hunt down these days? Our dinner companion ordered lobster ravioli with shrimp. The waiter brought the lobster ravioli out, then the shrimp, separately, in a little cup. Oh, and the shrimp was BOILED. What is this, 1965? What the actual f*#&.\n\nIt'd be one thing if this place was dirt cheap, but entrees hit well over $20.\n\nDo yourself a favor. Rather than coming here, just eat the money. Even if it's in coins.",0
"A friend and I visited on a Wednesday evening. The place was empty, save for a few people at the bar, ourselves included. \nI made the comment to my friend that this place gave off a \""""Ramsays Kitchen Nightmares\"""" vibe. He laughed. I worried, because the food hadn't arrived yet.\n\nThe manager (at least I'm assuming he was, he wasn't just behind the bar, he was all over the place) was friendly enough. Very nice chap. I'd give him 4 stars on personality if I could rate that here.\n\nThe prices are a bit overpriced. I had a simple 8\"""" Margherita pizza. At $9 for the pizza, that's more than a buck an inch. Normally price isn't an issue IF the food is worth it. It's pretty hard to mess up a pizza as simple as a Margherita. Or so I thought.\n\nThe pizza was very bland. They substituted oregano for the traditional basil. This substitute may be acceptable to a lot of you, but not to me. Basil makes a Margherita. In addition, it did not have enough olive oil, and it was a bit cold as well.\n\nThe pizza arrived, and as the manager put the plate down, the pizza slid halfway off the plate, and onto the bar. Half the pizza was now sitting on the bar counter. Using the spatula, he tried putting the half that fell onto the bar counter back onto the plate. After pushing the pizza around the bar counter several times trying to scoop it up, he apologized.\nAll I could think to say was - I hope the bar counter was clean. They said it was. I've only their word to take for that.\n\nDid he offer to cook us a new pizza? NOPE.\nDid he offer a discount on the check? NOPE.\nA few minutes later, he offered me and my friend each a shot of his homemade Limoncello, on the house. It was sub-par.\n\nI give this place a few more months before they're gone. \nAnd if the owner/manager of Joey's California Bistro is reading this, give Gordon Ramsay a call. Your place would make a great episode. It's just a shame I had the experience of eating in the 'before' version of this place.",0
"This place was terrible. My mom, daughter and I decided to try it out for dinner. My daughter ordered chicken fingers which were not that great. My mom ordered a chicken rigatoni which the noodles were crunchy and the sauce was bad. I ordered shrimp Alfredo and the shrimp and Alfredo sauce were spoiled. Service was very slow and the food was not edible. We have never sent food back, but tonight was the exception.",0
"Can't believe this place is still in business. We recently moved to the area and were were trying out all the restaurants. We ended up here on our anniversary.  The place was empty (that should have been our first clue).  All I remember is it was pretty expensive and it wasn't even good.  \n\nIf you want Italian food in the Deer Valley area, go to Time Square on 27th Ave & Deer Valley.",0
"Just read a good portion of the previous reviews and they seem consistent with my experience. Place was empty on a Thursday night . We ordered the ziti, lasagna and tilapia and the quality of the food was good. Touching on the other reviews I think the issue with spot is how disconnected the staff is and owner trying to do too much. Bartender, waiter, entertainer, etc... I don't think they know what they want to be yet.",0
"I reluctantly sent my overworked husband to Joey's to bring home a carryout of chicken piccata and chicken Parmesan. First of all, the meals were freezing cold, bland, and the piccata had no lemon taste whatsoever. We had three bites and threw the food away :(",0
"GROSS!!!!!!!My husband and I moved to the area about 2 yrs ago. I always see this place but have never tried it...Until last night. What a mistake that was. My mother and I were going to grab a bite before seeing a movie and she mentioned Italian. I did a local search on my phone and came up with this place. We walked in and the place was a complete hot and stuffy ghost town. We canceled our order of iced tea and water  so we could leave, but decided to stay. The water was served in a Bud Light pint glass with next to no ice. The tea was served in a wine glass....Huh??  Upon opening the menu  I was shocked. Given the location and d\u00e9cor, the prices were absolutely ridiculous. I ordered the Shrimp alfredo, she the eggplant parm.  My sauce tasted like it was from a can and had the viscous consistency of cheez whiz. Not to mention the TINY shrimp were what I would imagine chewing on an old tire would feel like. My mothers eggplant was chewy, not peeled, and drowning in cheap greasy cheese. I sent mine back, and declined a diff entr\u00e9e. My mother powered through hers and ended up paying 20 bucks for it..  This place needs a Kitchen Nightmares make over ASAP!! I feel sorry for the poor staff who choose to hang on to the railing of this sinking ship. Our server was sweet. Poor gal. Left a good tip... Here's one for you reading this...DON'T GO! I ended up at the fast food place in the same complex which was still gross.",0
The staff if very nice. I got a salad to go and was disappointed when I got home. There was spring mix with maybe one tomato 3 slices cucumber halved and one (yes that is correct) one piece of cheese. This salad was $10. It tasted nice but wasn't worth the money.,0
"We had a family function here and I was sadly disappointed. I felt that the entrees were of average quality , but the service was terrible. We had made a reservation days in advance yet still the staff seemed unprepared for our service. We sat for ages until we finally had to ask for them to take our orders. I believe I asked for wine, then water 3 times as did other members of our party until my husband just started walking up to the bar and basically serving our party drinks.",0
Food was amazing! Service was personable but adequate. Empty place but worth the doubt!,1
"Having just moved into the neighborhood, we ventured to try Bamboo House, hoping to find a close place to get our Chinese fix. Unfortunately, on our visit, B.H. did not live up to the hype. My boyfriend put it very succinctly: \""""There wasn't anything wrong with the rice.\"""" We ordered meat dumplings, orange chicken and garlic chicken. The meat dumplings were no frills, basically barely seasoned meat stuffed into wrappers and then fried. The orange chicken was passable, but nothing special (I think Panda Express does better, and I loathe that place). The garlic chicken was a spicy, sodden mess, barely edible. As if this wasn't disappointing enough, my hot tea was weak, vaguely honey flavored water. His iced tea appeared to be the same tea poured over ice. But, at least the rice was okay, right?",0
"How can you not love a place that has $3.50 drinks with umbrellas and fruit garnishes and the best cocktail sign ever?! I have only ordered the drinks, the chicken wings and the pad Thai and I loved them all. So far, this is my favorite pad Thai in the valley. My husband likes Pei Wei's version better, which I don't understand . I order mine not too spicy here, because otherwise it is quite spicy!",1
"Disclaimer: Vegetarian here.\n\nBamboo house is one of our favorite Chinese restaurants in North Phoenix. Other people think so too, as it is normally very busy, although the place is big with ample seating, so there is generally no waiting.\n\nThe egg drop soup is delicious. They will make it Vegetarian if requested (water base instead of meat broth). We just love that soup!\n\nThey also serve hot tea (Oolong?) to everyone, which is another big plus in our book.\n\nThe main courses are good, I enjoy the orange flavored tofu and some of their other veggie dishes as well. My girlfriend has tried some of the meat dishes and was happy with them. Dishes come served with either steamed or fried rice (which might be a dollar extra).\n\nWe really like this place and would recommend that you check it out.",1
"I have been eating here since they opened 10 years ago. Very good consistent food at an amazing value. The owner Sam is there most of the time and takes good care of his diners most of whom are neighborhood regulars. We get take out from here every week and have tried most of what is on menu at least once. If you are unsure what to order definitely consider the various family  dinner options and come hungry. Easy parking, full bar, simple neighborhood place with emphasis on food not d\u00e9cor.",1
"Let's just say this. I feel sorry for you people who thinks this restaurant serves good food. Went there after reading all your fine reviews here. I will be short and sweet. Hot and sour soup was passable, the pad thai was edible. House chicken was big chunks of deep fried breading with salty brown sauce. Mongolian beef was salted jerky with green onions, and the fried rice is just white rice with soy sauce in it. The soda was okay. If you have ever had decent Chinese food,, stay clear. This is not it. Will someone get my money back?",0
"I'm sorry to say that I'm not impressed with Bamboo House.  They're friendly and the takeout wait isn't long (I haven't dined in), but their food is pretty mediocre.  The first time I visited, I ordered the eggplant with garlic sauce.  It was a little bit bland and rather greasy.  Edible but not something I would order again. \n\nA week later, I decided to give them a second try, and ordered vegetable spring rolls and orange flavor tofu.  The spring rolls were actually pretty good - fresh, crispy and flavorful.  However, the orange tofu was terrible.  The tofu was soggy (bleh!) and the sauce tasted rather like the sweet and sour sauce they provided to go with the eggrolls - good enough for dipping appetizers in but terrible when your entree is smothered in it.  I couldn't even finish the dish and ended up throwing it away which is a first for me. :(  I won't be going to Bamboo House a third time.",0
JUST say no.. the worst General Tsos chicken I have ever tasted.. its supposed to be spicy.. not so sugary.. and seriously I was ill that night.. my friend had sweet and sour...and it was sour and not sweet.. the lady was so nice .. how do you complain! I had always wondered about this place near where I wander and now I wont wander back..,0
"IMO THE best Chinese in Phoenix! Authentic dishes and Chinese beers, excellent service, great atmosphere, very good prices - thoroughly recommend.\n\nClearly I am not the only one thinking this as the owner appears to know the names of a LOT of the clientele - demonstrating regular repeat business.",1
"Really good, old school authentic food.  Very affordable and quick.  Highly recommend.",1
"All of their alcoholic beverages, including martinis are $4.50... but beware, when you order said drink, the server will most likely stare back at you blankly, nod, and walk away. Server will then arrive with a \""""fruity drink\"""" that may or may not have a crusty cherry in it. But, it's $4.50. Sure, you had a hankering for a Tom Collins, but just keep quiet and drink your fruit punch.  \n\nThe cuisine here is a notch above the liquor... I cannot tear them apart on this, because it truly is the best Chinese I have ever had for this price. My man and I are creatures of habit and we always order the same things... we start with the egg flower soup, then order the sweet and sour chicken, and lastly, the orange chicken, because we are Americans who love sweet, fattening, fried chicken.\n\nThe staff is friendly, the food is prompt and delicious, we spend about $30 to $40 each visit and just writing this review makes my mouth water. \n\nCheers",1
"From previous experiences, this had become one of our favorite Chinese food restaurants in the valley.  We went here for dinner tonight with high expectations.  Tonight's visit was unbelievably disgusting!  It started off with us receiving dirty silverware only to be replaced twice by none other than some more dirty silverware.  Then the plates we received were dirty and had to be replaced as well.  As if this wasn't disgusting enough, as we were eating, my boyfriend found a dead spider in his food!  We brought in to the attention of the manager and he offered to bring us more food but who could eat after that? Needless to say, that was the end of our dining experience and we will not be returning.",0
"I like to make it a point to find the good in all experiences.  Unfortunately, the only good thing that I have to say about my experience is that the portions were huge, however it ended up just being a lot of awful food.  I ordered the chicken Pad Thai. I was excited to see the enormous mound of of Pad Thai next to an equally impressive side of fried rice.  Excitedly, I twirled a good fork full of noodles with a nice piece of chicken, and took what I expected to be a glorious mouth full of my all time favorite Thai dish.  It took everything I had not to spit this deceptive bite of food right back on to the pile of which it came from.  This restaurant uses the wrong noodles, poorly seasoned chicken, and a sauce that left a lot to be desired.  Next I tried the fried rice, which was rice and soy sauce.  Maybe it was just my dish, but it was enough to ensure I wont be visiting this eatery again.  It is unfortunate as the wait staff is very friendly and attentive.",0
"My girlfriend and I ate here recently and I get nauseas thinking about this place.\n\nI ordered a seafood dish with noodles and veggies. The scallops were still very cold in the center. The little corncobs (cant think of the name) tasted stale in my dish as well as my girlfriends. I could only eat a few bites and I had to quit. \n\nI hate complaining when I go places and I should have said something to them, but instead I will simply not return and let others know to avoid this place. Simply put, the food sucks and this place needs to close.",0
"Meh, I've experienced better, pretty much covers it.\n\nThe young man who brought water and tea didn't know what tea he was serving us. No straws were brought- big peeve of mine. I dislike drinking from cups at restaurants.\n\nThe egg rolls tasted of perfume. Chicken chow mien was ok, $5.95 for M-F lunch special. They never asked if we wanted desert.",0
"I'll make this easy; this is the best Chinese food in Phoenix.\n\nI have eaten here or purchased take-out at least a dozen times, and I have always been amazed at the quality of the food.  There might be flashier Chinese food restaurants in the valley, but I have yet to find one that has better food.",1
"Since new ownership in late summer of 2013 this once excellent restaurant is a shell of what the former owner built. \nI have lived in Moon Valley for 30+ years and the Bamboo house was a once a week stop. I will never return! Food quality has diminished, portion size diminished, bland flavor. Take out containers barely 3/4 full. \nI would welcome to discuss my thoughts with new owners as I am NOT the only one who believes this. My neighbors have the same feelings on the recent downfall of this once neighborhood favorite.",0
"The last few times that I have been there, the food has been horrid.  You ask for suicide hot and get sweet!  Ask for crispy and get it so overcooked that it is chicken jerky.  \n\nWe went to go have lunch the other day and noticed that someone new was hanging a lunch special banner and I asked him if it was new owners.  I was told it was.  \n\nUnfortunately, the food is not the same and now I am looking for a new Szechuan place.  Any suggestions?",0
We ordered family meal...first visit!!,1
"As a European, I have a love of curry that I've had trouble filling in Phoenix so far, but Bamboo House's shrimp curry with fried rice hit the spot. I'll definitely be back! The crab puffs were yummy too!",1
"Bamboo House is an unassuming Chinese restaurant with a cozy, no frills interior. We went on a Saturday night, and they seemed busy. Still, they sat us right away and were incredibly attentive all evening. Great service. \n\nNow for the food. The hot and sour soup is a must order. It was perfect. We also ordered the beef and broccoli and the shanghai noodles. Both were super tasty; however, their menu is massive so I don't think I'll ever order the same entree twice. \n\nFinally, the drinks. Five stars for their cocktail menu. They have a huge list of cocktails that would do the cast of Mad Men proud. Lots of classics and some fun Polynesian drinks, complete with fruit garnish and paper umbrellas. And the cocktails are cheap to boot, not to mention delicious.  I recommend the coconut gin one. \n\nI'm moving away from this neighborhood, but I'll definitely find excuses to head to North Phoenix just so I can get back to this place. A neighborhood gem for sure.",1
"Ok, I USED TO LOOOOVE this place. Mostly, because of the previous owner Sammy and his wife...however my recent experience under the new ownership & management left me missing my prior friendly, efficient, and humble service I so looked forward to seeing before.\n\nThe food-\nSame menu, however FRESHNESS....?? My fried rice tasted \""""day old\"""" and my hot and sour soup, was warm and splattered all over the outside of my bowl. \n\nCleanliness-\nAlthough, the new manager seemed well versed and knowledgeable in the area of food and caffeine content in the jasmine tea served, he seemed oblivious to the 3 flys  swarming our dining table...thus leaving me with the notion of not desiring to return anytime soon.  Which, is so disappointing as I liked to frequent this place on a cloudy day.",0
Update - the Bamboo House has new owners.  The food has not changed and the service seems to be even better.  I still love this place and eat here regularly.,1
"Beware of the fried rice!  \nThis place is in my neighborhood and one weeknight in March we went for the first time when family was visiting. We ordered fried dumplings to start, saut\u00e9ed green beans, double saut\u00e9ed sliced pork, beef with broccoli and chicken with mixed vegetables with an order of steamed rice for the table. I must say we all thoroughly enjoyed our food! I didn't care for the pork, thought it was too \""""porky\"""" but everyone else liked it so I'm the outlier.  The woman manager/owner comes up to us at the end, asks us how we liked our meal. I tell her we really enjoyed it, we live in the neighborhood and we'd definitely be coming back. Then this is where it went south. She asked us if we'd like boxes for our leftovers and we were debating whether to take the steamed rice. She says she can give us a carton of steamed rice packaged already and my husband says that if we take rice, we'd just take our leftover from the table rather than the carton she was offering.  \""""We wouldn't want it to go to waste and take new rice.\""""  Her reply??? \""""Oh that doesn't go to waste, we use for something else.\"""" Oh really?? My husband asks what it is used for and I'm not joking...she replied  \""""We use that for fried rice\"""". We were speechless. And just so there is no confusion about what rice she was talking about, that we are absolutely clear we were talking about the half eaten rice ON our table she says, pointing to the bowl on our table, \""""see, it's like nobody really touches it anyway.\""""  I'm not joking. We left absolutely devastated! And though I really liked the food, I will not eat here again and cannot recommend it to anyone else. There are basic minimums I expect from a restaurant I patronize and reusing leftovers from the table is outrageous and unacceptable.  So sad.",0
"We used to really like Bamboo House and were surprised when we went there for lunch and there were no cars in the parking lot, not a single customer inside.   Food was dreadful, like over fried and left on a steam table for a month.  We couldn't even chew through the egg roll and every bite of chicken, half of it was spit out. Stringy tough.\nThey are going to have to do a major overhaul before I go back.",0
"Just wasn't good\n\nI really hate to write a negative review about a restaurant that receives so many positive comments but the food at Bamboo House just wasn't good. With that being said let's start off on a positive note.  If you go to Bamboo House , you will receive good customers service. \n\nNow time to move onto the meal.  My meal got off to a bad start with the egg-drop soup, which consisted of a tasteless, watery liquid in which floated, hard peas, tofu, and thick strands of eggs.  Moving onto the entrees, the Mongolian Beef was tough and chewy, the chicken chow mein dish was likewise an exercise for one's jaw. The rice, eggrolls, and fried wontons were equally disappointing.\n\nIn all honesty, I would be hard-pressed to think of a place with worse Chinese food.",0
Great dinner food was hot and tasty.   Richard our server was very efficient and friendly.   Great service.,1
"The good: it's cheap and the service was great. The bad: I'm still not sure if I was eating chicken...\n\nI ordered the Chicken Chow Mein in hopes of receiving a dish so good my guilt for ordering it would disappear into a plate of fresh and flavorful noodles; however, the so-called \""""Chicken Chow Mein\"""" from Bamboo House left me regretting every decision I ever made that afternoon. (I'm still not sure if it was chicken I was eating.) The fried rice tasted like old burnt leftovers - my lover and I kept imagining the food coming from the frozen section at your local grocery store. Unfortunately, I think the frozen section would have better prepared food than this place. \n\nI hate writing bad reviews because it's the death of restaurants, but when the food tastes like leftovers from the patrons of last nights dinner rush - and by rush I mean 6 people - and the chicken is so questionable that you contemplate drinking toilet water so the possibility of throwing up is higher, you have to share the bad news.",0
"As I try to chew my rubbery, non-spicy General Tso's chicken, I'm writing this review with a feeling of  regret for spending $30 at this place. I'm pretty sure the chicken is seasoned with beef flavor Top Ramen spice, and the pad Thai is made with the noodles from the same package. I contemplated finishing the food but I think I'm going to have to wave the white flag. Never. Again.",0
"My daughter and I frequent this place.  I am addicted to their veggie burrito and E is addicted to their cheese crisp.  It really is fresh and simple meixcan food.  I also like their chips and salsa.  Good price, good food, good service...this is what keeps us going back",1
"They are unapologetically slow, fresh, clean, and full of quality, tasty, good stuff....\n\nhow could I not love Baja Fresh?  It's just like ME!",1
"Oh what a sad fall from grace... My previous review of Baja Fresh was very favorable. This one, not so much.\n\nThe experience started off poorly when the cashier sneezed in his hand while we were ordering. He never went to wash his hands afterwards. Perhaps he wasn't handling food directly, but he's grabbing chip bags, trays and other items right next to your food. Thanks for spreading the germs, dude.\n\nAs a starter, at least we managed to enjoy the tortilla chips & their wide selection of salsas.\n\nFor the main course, we ordered some grilled veggie burritos enchilada style. When they arrived, we were highly disappointed. The enchilada sauce didn't taste that good and the burrito contents were mostly cold. What part of \""""Grilled veggie burrito\"""" is supposed to have cold vegetables?\n\nWith a brand new Chipolte across the street, it looks like we won't be visiting Baja Fresh any more.",0
"I had a Groupon for this place and after looking at the menu online, I was excited to try it. I adore Chipotle and that type of fresh mexican style food, so this seemed perfect. Yeah, not so much... \n\nI had the shrimp bowl which is apparently new to the menu. Maybe they need more practice or refining on this item because it was not good. The rice was bitter, the veggies tasted like burned oil, and the shrimp were chewy. The only semi-redeeming things for this meal were the pico and guac that I added. My husband had the 2 taco combo and he said it was \""""meh...\"""".  We had to spend $15 to fulfill the Groupon so we got a churro - yum!!\n\nI dint think we'll be going back any time soon... Chipotle has won our business.",0
"okay so I haven't yelped in a while and let me tell you I have a lot to yelp about!\n\nMy boyfriend and I went here on Sunday and got the worst service ever!!!! I actually called and complained about it to 2 different stores because when I called this Bell road store to complain they said there was no manager and the girl who answered was the girl I wanted to complain about so DUH I wasn't going to tell her my complaint so she could pass it on to no one so that is why I called the other locations which No one ever called me back soooo... we will never be going back here. \n\nSo on Sunday we went here and yes they were a little busy. Our order was taken within a few minutes and then we proceeded to the salsa bar which either the person before us made a huge mess or the thing hadn't been cleaned in a while. My boyfriend and I ordered the EXACT same thing... chicken taco plate, flour tortillas, mild salsa, add onion. Simple right??? Okay so the taco plates comes with a small bag of chips.... I asked him if I could get a small side of guac for my tacos- he then asked \""""do you want the 8oz size with chips\""""... and I told him NO... my meal comes with chips I just want a small side. (which I have gotten before and I think it was like 1.50 or so.) So me not paying attention to the receipt didn't realize that yes indeed he did (even though he asked me and I said NO) charged me for the 8oz with chips. Now like I said I just wanted a little guac for my tacos. Which not to mention the guac isn't really all that great. The tacos are good, the service is bad. \n\nSooooooooooooo anyways after we get our salsa we then sit down at a table to wait for our food. Pretty much every single open table was dirty too. Almost immediatly after sitting down a plate comes up in the window and is put under the heating lamp. About 5 minutes goes by and that same plate is still sitting up there. Okay so now the girl working puts that 5 min old plate in a bag and sets it there on the counter. And now about another 5 minutes goes by and a plate comes up in the window and she gets it and puts it in the bag with the old plate. And of course... my luck... it's our food! Okay now like I said before... we ordered the EXACT same thing! So now why did one come up in two minutes and the other take 10???  \n\nSo trying not to be rude but KNOWING that that 10 min old 5 minutes sitting in a bag food was going to be COLD.... I asked her \""""why did the one come up so fast and the other take so long and they are the exact same thing... isn't that one going to be cold since it has been sitting in a bag for like 10 minutes\"""".... and she so rudely said \""""I DONT KNOW\"""".... I don't know???? really????? are you kidding me... that was her answer. So I said again \""""isn't that one going to be cold\""""... I'm sorry but I don't go out to get cold food... and she said again even more rudely \""""I DONT KNOW\"""". Uummmmmmmmmmm I think that should have been the point where she had them remake the food so it would be hot or something. \n\nOkay so then back to the guac.... So like I said I had realized that he had charged me for the 8oz when I only wanted the small side...  So I then mentioned to the RUDE girl that \""""hey you guys charged me for the large side when I only wanted the small side\"""".... and she said \""""WELL IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME\""""... ??????? what really???? it's totally not the same. You guys are now charging me for chips when my meal comes with a small bag. yes it was a lot more chips then we usually get but the point is... We didn't want them! So then I mentioned to her that my meal comes with chips and that I didn't want to buy extra chips and then SHE TURNS AROUND... GRABS THE TWO SMALL BAGS OF CHIPS THAT THE MEAL COMES WITH, BASICALLY SMASHES THEM IN HER HAND WHILE SHOVING THEM AT ME, AND PRETTY MUCH SAYS... HERE'S YOUR CHIPS. \n\nLike I said... the tacos are good - BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME TO COME BACK AND BE TREATED LIKE GARBAGE BY SOME GIRL. I am a paying customer that doesn't like to pay for cold food, be charged extra for something that I didn't order, call to talk to a manager and be told that there is no manager, call and complain to not one but TWO different locations and be told by TWO different locations that a manager will call me back and have TWO different locations NOT CALL ME BACK! \n\nWILL NEVER GO BACK!",0
"Well I suppose I am kinda biased as I teach at YP. But it wasn't always that way. I used to practice at other studios around town and had always enjoyed classes. I metEric, the owner, through a business meeting and we got talking. He invited me to practice and I haven't looked back. Since then I completed the 500 hour certification program and the studio is part of my life. \n\nIf you are looking for something different, go to Pura. The classes still give you the physical work out but what's different is that you get the philosophy too. Not just a few new age words sprinkled in here and there but a truly holistic understanding of this ancient practice.\n\nTry it once. You never know. You might like it.",1
"Thank You Amy D. \n\nIf it were not for her, i would not have brought in the new year the best way i now know how to... \n\nby doing YOGA! :) \n\nthe lady at the front desk was amazing ... she was very calm and welcoming... that made me feel more comfortable since i don't ever go anywhere alone... and i had never done yoga ever in my life... two new things in one night...

"OK, for starters... I'm all about handstands and arm balances. Also, I believe that yoga is about listening to your body and doing the pose that is right for you.  Therefore, if your in a pose and you think you should go deeper than do it!  When I go to a power class and I'm told not to modify and the teacher is overweight, I get scarred that it's going to be a bad class.  Also, power yoga should be taught by type A people. You can be mellow and spiritual, then teach a restorative class. Enough ranting!\n\nYoga Pura has a nice vibe, but for starts it smells like an old gym, where are the air fresheners and sage folks? Wow!!  The people there are really nice, but the Manger that teaches power should only be allowed to teach level 1 Flow and Restorative classes. She is a very sincere woman and a had a great spirit, but she should not teach power!  Her class was so bad that I barley broke into a sweat. We spent 40 mins in ansana for an 85 min class!!!! That is nuts for a power class. \n\nI understand the owner Eric is awesome, but he needs to look who is teaching his more advanced classes. Yoga has changed and people are more advanced. This studio is behind the times.\n\nIf you want a great yoga studio in Phoenix, then your best option is AtoneYoga! Enough said.",0
"What a wonderful, warm and welcoming yoga studio!  Come here to learn yoga or to really get into your practice.  Be sure to try Yoga Nidra and pick up something eye-catching in the delightful boutique.  \n\nSTYLE:\nThis place is perfect if you're a newcomer to yoga.  Yoga Pura has beginner and intro classes to start you off right, improve your postures, or just focus on the fundamentals.  The flow classes are a wonderful way to expand your practice, a touch slower and cooler than some other studios, with simpler transitions that allowing more focus on each pose.  There are many hot, sweaty, fast flow places in the city, where it helps to know exactly what you're doing, but not nearly enough places to learn the basics and hone the craft.  \n\nThe studio concentrates on more than just the postures (shapes, as they say), and draws students' attention to the purpose behind them - calming the mind and body, strengthening mental and emotional endurance to prepare for life's challenges.  There's a bit of chanting, they say Jai Bagwan instead of Namaste, and each class begins with a brief lesson - just the teacher's insight into some aspect of yoga theory, a suggestion of something to focus on while you breathe and bend into poses.\n\nAside from the soothing atmosphere, the studio's classes are free to all current of former members of the US military.  The owner, Eric Walrabenstein, is also the creator of the incredible BOOTSTRAP program, which is an absolutely free, at-home program for treating PTSD related to military service - and it's based on yoga techniques.  It's inspiring to learn from a teacher with such a rich history and depth/breadth of understanding.\n\nCLASSES:\nI highly recommend Basics classes with Eric Walrabenstein (the inspiring studio owner), flow classes with Jen Brooks (lovely class, lovely voice!), or Intro series with Laura or Marta (they'll help you sort out which limb goes where).\n\nThis studio also offers Yoga Nidra (guided meditation) classes which are absolutely transformative.  If you think you can't get anything out of lying down, perfectly comfortable, and relaxing your mind for 45 minutes, you're in for an incredible surprise.  It's one of the most beneficial forms of yoga, and it feels wonderful.  I highly recommend it, and this is one of the few studios that offers it. \n\nTIPS:\n1. Be a few minutes early: this isn't just a place to exercise, so it's a little quieter and more respectful.\n2. Bring a hand towel - they don't offer towel service, and if you're anything like me, you don't need a hot room to break a sweat.  \n3. They have 3 nice bathrooms but no showers.  Plan accordingly.",1
Very authentic yoga. It's so nice to not just rush through different positions like some other studios. Feel such a connection here and leave class spiritually and physically refreshed. So happy this place is so close to my home. The studio is a little stinky though. Wish the rooms opened up to outside for airflow. Not sure what a solution is because people have allergies so can't just throw on some incense or essential oils. Worth it though. This does not ever stop me from coming and is really only an issue when going to a class late in the evening.,1
"This is a hair salon that does nails on the side. I think if nails were the main source of revenue they would be better at it and have a wide variety of name brand polishes to choose from.\n\nThe manicure was below average, I should have suspected as much when I saw the condition of my manicurist's nails & cuticles.\n\nI will not be returning.",0
"Very friends staff, Heather has done my hair for 4 years now!  She does a WONDERFUL job and is the sweetest girl, I highly recommend her. Very affordable.",1
I went to this place with family. The service was ok and food was ok but I had a rice water in a large sized cup. The beverage was full of cinnamon at first I was really thirsty so I thought nothing of it. When I got home about 3 hours later I thought I was having a mental breakdown. My head felt weird like I was losing my mind... In short I did some research online and it says that cinnamon is a mild hallucinogenic like ecstasy. So I don't know if it was the drink or the food. I will not be going back to this place ever.,0
"SO I love me some 'Bertos' anything since Ive moved into the valley... all the Bertos confuse me.. is it Filibertos? Because Im confused.. well, maybe its a blonde thing I just dont get..

Nothing worse.. okay.. stomach is turned.. and money is wasted.. I guess I didnt need huevos rancheros anyway.. but when that kind of negligence takes place.. it doesnt deserve even a one star.. boo Bertos!",0
"Not sure about all the lesser reviews but this place is a favorite of mine. It's close by so I frequent it whenever I get the chance. The service is great because over the years,  with all the big orders, they have never gotten a single thing wrong! Always exactly what I want and cooked how we like it. The hours are incredible just like all the \""""Berto's\"""" in the city and they have two drive-thru lanes. They have an awesome staff that never changes, outdoor seating (with a TV) and come on...THEY NEVER CLOSE! All the people I bring here from out of town love it. Definitely worth a shot. Plus you can't beat the prices.\n\nTry the breakfast burritos.",1
"24hr Quick Mexican food??? How can you go wrong?! Think out side the box and try something you haven't before. I went for the Arizona Burrito. It was well made, great tortilla and held together until the end. Right down the street from me, I will be back!!!",1
"The food for a Taco Shop is Ok... I got 3 bean and cheese burritos for almost 16$ That's pretty dam pricey if u ask me. I didn't look at the price when ordering so shame on me , but when I got to the window and she took my $ I then asked how much burritos were she said 4.48$ each , shocked and stunned at the price still I didn't have time to do the math in my head , I get my food .. Confused , I pull over to see the menu and BEAN Burritos are 3.15$ cheese is .95 so that equals 4.10$ .. Where did she get 4.48$ ?? And how did it end up 16$ ?!?!  Long story short , BEAN and CHEESE burritos are not on the menu , cheese is a extra cost.  The burrito it's self isn't bad and isn't the best ... Bottom line - do the math before u order cause they don't . I will not be going there again , I can get way better 5$ bean and cheese somewhere else !",0
I go there often I like the food.   However the last time I went a couple weeks ago I got my old standby the Arizona burrito.  This time it was so bad I had to throw it out.  Dried out nasty.    Like it had been sitting there for a day.   I haven't been able to go back there because I keep thinking of that meal I had. It just ruined it for future visits. It could have been just a one time thing every restaurant has a bad day. But I was so turned off I didn't go back and probably never will. I normally would've given it four stars but not anymore,0

"I've lived in a number of apartments over the years and Crystal Creek was, by far, my favorite. It was a third floor one bedroom with a balcony that overlooked the pool. Since that balcony was on the west side I got a lot of sun some days but the sunsets and the thunderstorms made it worth it. I've often thought fondly of that apartment...\n\nThat was 7 years ago. Today, I learned that a few months ago Crystal Creek put a derogatory note on my credit for $62, lowering my score by 80 points. Seriously? After 7 years? Over sixty two dollars?\n\nI still don't even know what it was for. They haven't contacted me once in all this time - even though I lived in a property owned by their management company for three years after leaving Crystal Creek.\n\nThey insist that they're owed the money, too. I still don't know why. So now we have to go to court because I insist that they're high.\n\nDo you really want to live in a place where they'll go after your credit 7 years after the fact for a measly $62 without so much as a phone call?",0
"If you like waiting 2 days, literally, everytime you call maintenance to get something done...having a man dig through your garbage every morning, people stealing everything off of your patio (even a nasty ashtray), crack head neighbors, parties at the complex...calling security and NEVER having any one come, move in to Crystal Creek. \nThat babbling creek that people rave about brings mosquitos. The canal right next to the complex adds to that infestation. For about 5 months out of the year you will be eaten alive by them. The rest of the year it is actually nice. \nNothing in the gym ever works. They have 6 peices of equiptment and all that works is one bike and the weights. The treadmill is off and on. They have a broken elliptical, and a broken bike. An old Tv with 4 channels that you can't hear. No AC and it smells like someone died in there. \nKeep every receipt you ever give them. They took one of my two payments for security deposit and claimed they never received it.  I have no reason to lie about that, they called me after 6 months of living there saying they never received it. I had to come up with another 150$ randomly because of my failure to keep receipts and them retaining a thief. I felt it was safe after month 4 and cleaned all my papers out. \nWhen I moved in I had to clean everything, it was dirty. I moved into a carpet that was covered in stains. I complained about the smell, I could tell there were pets because my allergies were constantly keeping me up at nights. They finally agreed to change it and the front agent Christina said \""""I can't believe they let you move in with the carpet like that\"""". So I had to move all the stuff I just moved in back out off of the carpet, nothing was given to me for the inconvenience. \nThey did monthly inspections where they came into your apartment. I thought it was a cleanliness thing and I thought that it was a good thing since my neighbors were so disgusting, I did not want roaches. I came to find out that it was because they were selling the property and invading privacy was not an issue. \nI complained about the trash that my neighbors constantly left and they said they would take care of it, until my move out date I still had trash all by my front door and patio. \nThe washing machine smelled horrible and the tub was clogged. When I put in a maintenance request for them to fix it it took 2 days. When the man came he fixed the tub and said that he cleaned out the filter for the washing machine. This did not fix the smell, I chalked it up to being old and knew I would have to live with it.\n\nLast but not least...about two months before I moved out I was getting sick. I hated my neigbors and security never doing anything to stop the constant fighting and parties. Basically everything previously mentioned started getting to me to where I was miserable at home. I asked if I could move out and told them why. They said no, okay understandable, I did sign a year lease. I kept getting bloody noses and constantly felt sick. When I went to the doctor they told me it was allergies. \nOn my move out date I was packing my stuff and found black mold in my closet, in the hallway closet, it was coming from the washer. It had spread to many of my personal items. It was all over the base of the walls. Black mold is extremely dangerous and in some cases deadly. All the complex told me was that they would have to charge me for the drip pans on the stove. They did not apologize to me, they could care less. \nI would never live here again, even if rent was free.",0
"This is our default Piper. We have had several birthdays, nights out and just some play time here through out the years. \n\nOur most recent visit was for a birthday. They handled it perfectly, the kids stayed entertained, the adults stayed cool and the birthday girl had a good time. \n\nThe pizza seemed to get better then 10 years ago, the staff was great, and there was plenty of room for everyone.",1
"I go here for lunch when I'm really hungry. My last review mentioned how they never get the toppings right on special order pizzas. That problem has been thankfully corrected. Peter Piper is not the world's greatest pizza but it's certainly passable when you consider that you're paying about $7.40 for all you can eat pizza and all you can drink soft drinks. A great relaxing place to have a fairly inexpensive lunch when you consider a lot of places are approaching the $10 mark. Avoid Tuesday's in the Summer because that's when all the summer camp kids take over.\n\nNow that I'm a regular, the manager (Jarrod) puts my pizza order in when I walk in the door and it's ready in about 8-10 minutes. Excellent customer service, and his staff makes a great pizza with plenty of toppings.",1
I mean it has good pizza I love the ceaser salad.I enjoyed.,1
"I typically really enjoy Chili's and think the food and service is great. This is the first time at this location and will be the last. We went there for lunch last week and had horrible service and we were not even there during \""""lunch rush\"""". The waitress was not busy had maybe two other tables the entire time we were there. Yet, two tables that were sat after us in a different section received their food before us, even though we had ordered first. \n\nChips were greasy, food was cold and was impossible to get a refill on drinks. Next time we are craving Chili's we will drive a few extra miles and go to the Chili's at PV Mall.",0
"Okay. I love chili's and my family always loved doing a quick chili's to go order for Friday dinner. Since moving with my fiance to this location, I haven't had that experience! Tonight we ordered 2 buffalo chicken sangwiches. Simple! We get home and we have breaded chicken sangwiches with mayo.....okay. the rest of the order is fine so I call back and re ordered. My fiance and I didn't get to sit down to eat till 10;30pm! And what do we find? Another chicken w/mayo with wing sauce on the side....one with wing sauce and nothing else. \n\nThese guys were not busy when I went in to the To Go entrance and seeing as they ruined this simple order twice within an hour, means they've got some pretty bad cooks, or some pretty bad attitudes. \n\nOh and the fries were cold both times. Like not even \""""to go\"""" cooled...we live 3 blocks from the place!",0
"Ate here with a friend because we were starving and it was easy. ...not so fast. The place was filthy, wait staff ignored us for 15 minutes literally...I had to do the \""""hey miss can we get some service thing\"""" when she began helping people that had just sat down.\nThe food wad meh and frankly I couldn't get past the dirt factor. ....tables, floor, etc.  Neither one of us could continue.... her",0
"OH MY GOD.\n\nI completely understand how employees want to go home and not have people walking in when they are closing; but one day my mom and my siblings came to this location maybe 2-3 hours before closing time so  we thought we were okay.\nNO. The waitress barely had that many people to wait on and it took her a million decades to get us anything whether it be drinks or food. You almost did not want to ask for anything just because we wanted to get the hell out of there ASAP. We already knew what we wanted for a good 30 minutes before she came back and took our order.  Then we got our order maybe another hour to an hour and a half later! SWEET. By that time my mom being the feisty little Filipino lady that she is was absolutely livid and was complaining about when we would get our food. I don't rush people yes i am irritated and hungry but i will not rush you or get loud.  God only knows what they could do to my food behind closed doors. \n\n    So after staying at this location for 2 hours or so because of the long wait for everything i am slightly scared to go back to any chilis but i love their strawberry lemonade so its hard to refuse based on one girls performance or lack of.  As i finish my review on their not good food quality and piss poor service i cannot help but notice another girl had the same issue in june and i almost wonder if we had the same female who had waited on us and literally waited before taking our orders and giving us anything. If i went to this location which i highly doubt we will, i hope to god she is or was fired because if you cannot handle a couple tables and are no where to be found majority of the time something is just not right about that.  I am sorry. This is Arizona honey work laws suck here and if you aren't a decent worker you should not have a job unless you are being a brown noser with the managers and that's the only reason you are there is one of the many reasons i hate hate HATE Arizona work laws with a passion. But that is a whole other story.",0
"Oh Chili's. You really let me down this past Friday night. From the cheese fries being old (as if they had been reheated and reserved)  to the cooler than average steak. I did send the cheese fries back  and got a piping hot new order but I didn't send back the steak for fear of what may have been done to it after sending back the fries and also for fear that it would come out a hockey puck. I will say that even though it was not as warm as it should have been, it was at least cooked to perfection.  I will say that I was not the only patron sending food back in my area. The table in front and beside me also sent back food for various reasons. At least I wasn't alone in my food unhappiness. Eh I may come back again someday but you are not on my go to list anytime soon.",0
"Stopped in for dinner on a Sunday night.  A decent crowd and had to wait ten minutes for a table.  \n\nHostess was friendly and polite.  Wait staff is professional and act as if they enjoy their job.\n\nI've eaten at Chili's several times in the past few months and there is always a slight lag in the time between the order is taken and food is delivered.  Right before the lag starts to become noticeable, the food usually arrives.\n\nThis lag rarely bothers me because the quality of the food is so good.  The Chicken with the Fajitas tasted fresh and juicy.  All the food was really good. \n\nIf it wasn't for the barely noticeable lag in food delivery time, I could easily give this well run chain restaurant five stars.  Looking forward to many more visits.\n\nMango Tea                         2.59\nClub Quesadilla              10.09\nChicken Fajitas                12.99\n  Add Cadillac Side              .99\nTotal with tax                      28.70\nServer:    Jeff",1
"Have you ever gotten to a restaurant and then wanted to stab yourself in the hand with a fork? Me neither.\n\nThis was my reaction to chilis. I don't ever remember this local neighborhood joint being tasty, but the boyfriend and I edge starving and decided to give it a whirl. \n\nOur whirl was consistent of waiting in the lobby for over 5 minutes for the hostess to acknowledgments us. Not sure where she was but we waited patiently. As a side note, it was 9 pm, and we were the only folks on the lobby.\n\nWhen we finally got our table, the table was still wet from being cleaned. This does not feel good when one is wearing shorts. The menus were disgusting. They were sticky, ripped, faded, food stuck on gross.\n\nNeedless to say we actually walked out of the restaurant.\n\nOne star only because I cant put zero and the waitress didn't ask us to pay for our iced tea.",0
Rude bartender\nNeeds to learn how to fix drinks instead of arguing about it...specially when someone in training is making them and he didn't offer to help or fix the matter.....,0
"Food was great, as were the prices. Shared the 2 for $20 with my husband & left full. I had the chicken fajitas & he had the honey chicken crisper things. Also had the cookie skillet for dessert, yummm! Service was good.",1

"I guess as I'm getting older I'm seeing the value in things a little more clearly. I used to really enjoy going out to eat and didn't ever stop to wonder if I was getting a good deal. Lately, though, I've been paying close attention to what all of the foods cost and comparing them to other eating establishments.\n\nMy daughter's school was having a fundraiser at this Chili's last night. It was the kind that they donate a certain percentage of the total bill to the school. We try to help the school whenever we can, so we decided to make it a fun night out with the kids. My daughters enjoyed themselves and saw a few friends, and we all got to relax and let other people do the work.\n\nMy issue with this restaurant, though, and why I gave it two stars, is strictly with the value of the food. I understand that the costs of everything are increasing, so business establishments have to raise their prices accordingly, but they should still be able to offer a decent value.\n\nWe ordered the Southern Smokehouse Bacon Burger for my wife and I to split, and the kids ordered a corn dog and a quesadilla. My wife and I usually split meals because they are so big and calorie-laden, and it helps to keep costs down. Most of the time we leave feeling full and happy. When they brought out our food this evening, though, my half of the burger was tiny! The burger was supposed to contain bacon and onion straws, and according to pictures, was supposed to be packed with them. There was a tiny piece of bacon on my half, and a few scattered onion straws. I looked over to my wife's plate, expecting to see the bulk of the toppings on her burger, but her toppings were as pathetic looking as mine. The size of her half of the burger was not much bigger than mine, either. She said hers was exceptionally greasy and didn't taste how she expected it to taste. This was a little burger to start out with, and splitting it only made it worse. And it was $10.99!!\n\nThe burgers are, like most places, served with french fries. When we split meals at other restaurants, they usually give us both a full portion of fries. I know it's not the healthiest thing to be chomping down, but because we go out to eat so infrequently we don't worry about it. We want to get a pile of fries with our meal. The amount of fries delivered with our meal last night was a joke! My wife had maybe fifteen fries on her plate, and I had about eight. Seriously?! I know this restaurant is in business to make money, so they don't want to give everything away, but how much does an extra handful of fries cost for the few people that are splitting meals.\n\nThe kids meals were, in their opinion, good. The corn dog and celery sticks were quickly devoured, while the quesadilla and oranges were left mostly intact. (typical kids!). I tried a few bites of the quesadilla. It was ok, but was pretty small because of the meager amount of cheese. The kids meals, with the included drink, are $4.99. Not cheap, but not outrageous either.\n\nI like to leave every restaurant feeling that I got a good value for my money. I know that a good restaurant can give me that, while still making a decent profit off of me. When we left last night we looked at our bill and reminded ourselves why we don't go out very often. My wife said that she's going to keep the bill, so that any time she craves this type of food she can look at it and remind herself that we can eat much better and cheaper at home. Or at least at a restaurant that gives us our money's worth.",0
"We were hungry and I was thinking Chili's would be much like Applebee's. You know great food and service? Well boy was I wrong. \nThe restaurant was super loud and it was difficult to talk. We were hungry and ordered \nNachos. Seems like an easy plate to make, but they bring us 5 chips (no kidding!) with beans and cheese on them (sort of like mini cheese crisps). The presentation was horrible, they tasted even worse. I end up ordering a chicken salad and my friend something like a rice black bean bowl. I was brought a huge salad that looked awful and tasted worse. Just wilted lettuce and chicken (that tasted like it was old). I ate two bites and had had enough. The waitress had no desire to provide us with any level of service and kept on coming back to us almost rushing us to leave. This was almost the worse dining experience ever! Stay Away! $30 for a awful appetizer and two entrees. Never again.",0
"Seriously what the hell happened to this location!?! I used to come here ALL the time over the past 2 years but I haven't been here for a couple months and disappointing is all I have to say. Came in and sat at the bar for lunch on Saturday it really wasn't that busy and it was just one thing after another. My friend and I had ordered almost the same exact meal (just slightly different) we had the fajita trio I had mine plain and she wanted hers with all the peppers, onions and spices. So our food comes out and to our surprise there is only ONE plate! Seriously idk how this guy did not here the TWO separate orders. Of course at that point we are forced to send it back and wait for another 20+ minutes for our food to come out. And of course I had to talk to the manager to make sure they didn't just put that one plate (that was completely plain mind you) under the heat lamp to sit there while they cooked the other one. I'm not going to eat some nasty heat lamp food because you messed up.\nSo finally the food comes out after 25 minutes and the next thing I know is I look down and my plate has all sorts of spice on top of the beef, shrimp & chicken. I ask the guy why is all this nasty red spice sauce is on there and he tells me he thought I said I just didn't want peppers & onions. What part of PLAIN is that difficult to understand especially after the first plate that was brought out didn't have anything on it!\n\nNeedless to say the newer manager didn't do a damn thing no discount no apology absolutely nothing. What was supposed to be just lunch ended up into an early dinner because of their constant mistakes. I never have had a problem here so this was disappointing to say the least. I even remember when the manager who was there at the time first started & it wasn't too long ago and even then he was completely useless with a very unruly customer who was a constant disruption. Seriously bring back the Chili's I'm used to!!",0
I try to make it here at least once a week. Consistently good quality food and great service every time I've been in. Pretty good happy hour menu but I usually do their dinner for 2 promotions and Presidente margaritas.,1
"I waited at the front for about 10 minutes before someone finally noticed me. Our service was very attentive.. almost too attentive. They kept interrupting me and my boyfriend to consistently refill our already full waters. We had probably 3 different servers that night and although it was 10pm, they were very off task. I could hear them cussing and messing around in the back. My skillet cookie wasn't very good either :(",0
Love this chili's. Friendly bar staff and always quick to serve. Victoria it's the best!,1
"Food was up to par today. My last experience was mediocre and still decided to give this place another try. We ended up with the same unfriendly and rude bartender.  It was like once he realized we were only doing margaritas and an appetizer, we were not worth his time. I had to walk up to the bar to get my food warmed up and had to wait 10-15 mins to get a refill on salsa after I initially requested it. It also took him another 10 mins or so to bring the bill after I initially requested it. He didn't have a problem stopping at other tables within the bar area to make small talk, provide refills or tabs to the two other occupied tables. If he was overwhelmed my advice would be to get an actual server in the bar area and he could stick to making drinks.",0
"Great service and food! We have never had an issue and are always happy to return. There is something to be said about good customer service, more places should concentrate on that.",1
"Let me start by saying that this is a 5 STAR REVIEW for a Sports Bar, not to be confused for a 5 star review for Ruth's Chris, or the like.\n\nAs far as sport's bars go, this is one I'm happy to go to to.  It's really big, with a room filled with pool tables, 4-6top tables where you can sit, eat, visit, and watch some games, and seats around the bar, where you can sit and watch games.\n\nAll the food is consistently satisfying. The environment is friendly and many of the folks are regulars, who have been seeing each other for years.  Great burgers and steak fries.",1
"OMG I wish we had gone here a long time ago.  This is an Italian restaurant/sports bar combo that fires on all cylinders.  Service, menu selection, food quality and quantity...all top notch.\n\nThe burger sliders were to die for, along with the sweet potato fries.  How many sports bars offer sweet potato fries???  \n\nCan't wait to return and try the pizza or calzone....",1
"Quality, authentic, Italian cuisine.  Mamma always taught me what good Italian food was from her homemade recipes, and this was instilled and passed along to my wop a$$.\n\nI can truly say that I hate places like Olive Garden and such for their American take on Italian cuisine.  They royally eff it up.  This place, however, does not.\n\nI remember always thinking this was just some dive bar located next to the grocery store.  I never imagined that food was served, and excellent food at that.  My mom wanted to go here for her birthday, hearing rave reviews, so we decided to pop on in and give it a try.  We have not stopped going ever since.\n\nPersonal favorites: homemade chicken noodle soup (odd for an Italian place, I know), freshly grated cheese in their shakers (which I eat as an appetizer in itself), and their alfredo sauce, which is NOT to be messed with.  I also have had their stuffed shells, which are to DIE for.  The red sauce is amazing, sweet yet tangy and succulent.  \n\nAside from the excellent food, which is the reason for the 5 star rating, this place is a bar.  They have a few games (pool, darts, etc.) when you first walk in, and a wrap around bar in the back.  Typical drinks and beer are provided, which seem to be reasonably priced.  \n\nIf you are Italian, and want some home cooked meals like your Momma made, then stop in for a treat.  If  you aren't pleased than perhaps you weren't raised on the same flavor I was.\n\nEnjoy!",1

"I consider this place my local bar. I live down the street in the Moon Valley area and it's always a great late-night choice. The beer selection is nice and the food isn't bad. Their kitchen's selection is not your average bar food. They have full pasta dishes, sandwiches, pizzas and a bunch of other great menu items. They have TVs surrounding the bar with sports on constantly. The service is quick, attentive and pleasant. Look the menu up on their website and call in your order, they'll have it ready. Try the Mexican Pizza.",1
Ammaccapanes very bad customer will keep me from ever stepping foot inside again. I work near buy and myself and coworkers frequent it. Lindsay the bar tender and john the bouncer have alway treated me very well. Oct 6 2013 1030pm I took a friend there for a beer and wings. The male bartender put in my order and brougt me a sm pitcher of kilt. My friend got a blue moon. I was waiting for my wings it wasn't busy as I finished my 1st beer. Second beer down still no wings last half beer started and I asked bartender to cancel wings. If I can't enjoy them with the beer what's the point. He acted as if I was being an a$$. And told me he won't void it cause he will have to pay for it. All with attitude. He checked the ticket time and it was over22 min for Wings wtf. I'm not paying for them I stated. He then explained how his boss the owner makes them pay for all voids and walkouts. This is illegal. The attitude and the owner being a jack hole is why I will never return. I will miss lindsay she was always great. If the male bartenders story was true or not. I paid for the drinks gave the tender some labor advice tipped to cover the wings and left. Sad and unhappy. This place craps on it guests threw the owners bad managing and the male bartender has no clue what customer service is about. Don't waste your time or money here unless lindsay is at the bar. Really.,0
Bad bad service.  And with attitude. Everytime I give it another try I regret it.,0
The food was great and service was best in North Phx. Nicole was very pleasant and made sure we were taken care of....always a great local spot.,1
"This place surprised me. The bar is huge, they have pool tables, and the atmosphere is laid back. Will return.",1
"Ordered a pizza and cheesebread for carryout, when I arrived I was informed that they do not handle bills larger than $20.\n\nAfter trying to \""""break\"""" my valid US currency at the nearby CVS (which would not...)\n\nI went back, to have the manager tell me they could not accept my valid US currency.\n\nI guess throwing away food is better customer service than accepting a paying customers money.\n\nI won't be back.",0
This place has crappy customer service. They forgot part of our order from tonight. When we called to get it corrected the manager was rude and unhelpful.,0
"This is a HORRIBLE Pizza Hut location. I don't know what their problem is. I've had orders messed up five different times now. One of the times the manager gave me a credit for a free pizza, yet next time I called in the other manager said that I couldn't have it for free, but only a discounted price. THEY HAVE AN ACCOUNT FOR ME ON FILE, it's not like I just pulled that out of my A** when I called back!!\n\nOur food has been incorrect, things have been missing, and it has shown up bone dry before. No fun, and they don't even act like they care when you call.\n\nThe latest debacle this evening was the wings. I like my wings saucy. Shouldn't be a problem, right? A long time ago, I ordered their wings and they were mostly dry. So from that point forward, I ordered extra sauce, which you have to pay 50 cents more. Yet every time I did that, the wings were drowning in sauce, so I didn't even need the extra sauce on the side. I kept paying for extra sauce for no reason. Tonight, I orders wings (no extra sauce) and just put a note to make sure the wings were sauced well. \n\nMy order is delivered...NO blue cheese that I paid money for, and the wings have spots where there isn't any wing sauce on them at all. Seriously??!!!!!\n\nI called and spoke with an extremely unhelpful guy, he sounded young. He wasn't listening to what I was trying to say and at one point said that I could order my wings without sauce on them. WTF my problem is that you guys don't put enough sauce on them!!! He then went on to say that my note said extra sauce and since I didn't pay they didn't put it on. Yet A) my note never said \""""extra\"""" and B) I always got the phone call from them in the past saying if you want extra sauce you have to pay the driver 50 cents. No phone call this time. I assumed that my directions in basic English would be clear to the average Pizza Hut worker. He said it's how they \""""interpret\"""" the note.\n\nThere is another Pizza Hut location closer to me, but for some reason this is the one that is assigned my address for delivery. Apparently the credit that they wanted to give me for the blue cheese is only good if I order from their location again. What a joke. I told them to not bother with the credit and hung up.\nI guess from now on we will only be eating Pizza Hut if we want to pick up our order, since we're done with this location for good.",0
"Well let me start off by saying that when you first wall in the place it smells like sewer!\nThe lady at the counter is also the lady making the pizza , how do I know this well her hands were full of white cheese (the older lady very nice but not so clean) and when I got my Debit card back it stuck like cheese!!  Gross I will not be going there again.  I hope she washes her hands before making the Pizza.  This is the Pizza Hut on 7th st and union hills.",0
"RUN AWAY. They may have a Pizza Hut sign and Pizza Hut food, but with the service you get, you would think you are in a back alley getting surgery from Michael J Fox. Metaphor aside, this location is TERRIBLE. Spend the time to go to a different location. They have an average of 2.5 stars for a reason. I placed an order online at 8:09 that was followed immediately by the email saying my food will be delivered at 8:39. At 8:20 I missed a call because I'm busy enjoying a laughter filled night in with my boyfriend. I check my phone to see the time at 8:21 and saw that I just missed a call from a number I didn't know.  FYI - I'm new to the area and AZ in general so every number is foreign to me.  I check to see if I have a voicemail from that number......NOPE....I go on about my night.  Fast forward to  8:59 when I checked my phone again (20 minutes after my food was supposed to arrive), I get frustrated thinking the food should have been here.  I look up their number and give Pizza Hut a call **SPOILER ALERT** It was Pizza Hut at 8:20pm.\n\nI call back, asking what's going on and instead of getting any information, I get told, \""""Hold on.\"""" Then I'm talking to someone new. Adam. Who I can assume is a manager, maybe? Anyway, I come to find out that my card was declined (thanks Chick Fil A and your security breech) and that they cancelled the order after I didn't answer my phone (because no American has more than one credit card). I bring up that I didn't have a voicemail from said caller which contradicts their policy/protocol which IS to leave a message. Said manager ADMITED that she (female caller) didn't follow protocol and had no sympathy that now an hour has passed and I'm a very unsatisfied client. Did you get that?.. The manager ADMITTED that they didn't follow proper protocol for this situation.  Adam, like a robot, kept repeating, \""""the best I can do is give you a $5 credit.\""""  Adam said they canceled the order after I didn't pick up the phone.  That's how disposable of a customer I am?? You're too lazy to leave a voicemail?? What if I was taking a shit? Screw me, I guess since I missed your call I don't get dinner tonight.  I'm supposed to have pizza hut's number memorized and know that a random 623 number was them?? Oh wait.... I would assume any reputable business would in fact leave a Voicemail if they needed to get in touch with me. \n\nOk well I'll remember that the next time I'm hungry. Oh balls, that's now. Well at least I have credits. They're low in fiber, just like everything else...because they're NOT FOOD! What could have made it right? Say \""""I'm sorry,\"""" I'll give you a different card and you get someone to bring me the dinner I ordered. But who am I? I'm just a simple girl with simple expectations.\n\nJust do yourself a favor and DO NOT expect any customer service from this location. Go elsewhere. I will be driving to a different Pizza Hut just to avoid this kind of awful handling of issues that arise. I know things happen but the way you deal with them is how you retain customers. Shame on you Pizza Hut.  I asked Adam, \""""Is it worth it to you to lose a customer who just moved to your area over a $16 order?\""""..... Apparently the answer is YES.  Employees don't follow protocol and do their due diligence to ensure their running a smooth a customer focused/customer satisfied business.  Worst Franchise EVERRRRR!",0
My experience here was easy breezy. I had to send a fed ex envelope and the representative was able to help me immediately. He gave me my receipt and showed me my tracking number and I was all set. I'd say I was in and out of there in 5 minutes.,1
"New info from AJs, they have reconsidered and plans to close this store are currently on hold.\n\n*************************************************************\nAJ's will be closing this location at the end of March 2008.\n\nThe currently are planning to replace AJ's with a Sportsman's as they bought the name several months ago.",1
"Dear AJ's,\n\nWhen I worked at the Pointe Hilton at Tapatio Cliffs down the street from you, you were the only thing I had to look forward to in the day.  There were a gazillion restaurants I could have eaten at on site, but they all sucked shit and treated other employees like crap for some reason.  You were my half hour reprieve from that god forsaken place, where I could escape the whiny assholes who'd come up to the front desk and my puffy-cheeked manager who'd roll his eyes if I wanted to smoke a cigarette.  Remember when I would come in twice almost every single day, once for breakfast, once for lunch and then you'd see me drive by at the end of the day and I'd wave and almost get into a car accident because I wasn't paying attention to the road?  Ahhhhhhh...\n\nYou're the only store in the valley that I know of that sells Cock and Bull ginger beer, quite possibly the best there is in the world, even better than the really good Jamaican stuff. [ *if anyone knows of better ginger beer, cough it up because I am in love with it* ]  Your other selections of gourmet sodas were all excellent choices too.  I really like your sandwiches, man; they hit the spot just right.  \n\nI wish I'd met you under better circumstances.  If I hadn't hated my job, you would have seen me smiling through the aisles.  As it was, you probably saw me eyeballing one of your many fine wines, contemplating if I should get drunk and tell my boss to go fuck himself.  Don't worry, I didn't.  I did quit though and immediately celebrated by eating a sandwich outside of you.\n\nI miss you a lot.  I don't really drive my car very much anymore, and if I did drive, no offense, that's pretty much the last part of town I'd like to be in, aside from obvious ghettos.  Perhaps I could move you, brick by brick to a new location that is closer to me?  No?  That's fine.  If you're not comfortable, I won't press it any further.  \n\nWith that, I just wanted to let you know that I love you.  I'm still a member of your sandwich club and have the card in my wallet.  It will be used again, old friend. \n\n-Billy",1
Being from Cali.. I love a great gourmet grocery ... I cant express how my heart flutters at the smell of a great cheese department.. not for the Cali in me but for the Parisian in me.. ahhhh! Bon Fromagerie!! I wont say this AJ's gets me going like the Aj's in other areas of PHX.. but still thats just pure out being high maintenance and picky picky.. Im happy to have this gem in the desert.. I love the wine department.. the cheeses.. the gourmet of it all.. oh yeah.. and the desserts:-) mmmmm a pure piece of heaven.. if Im feeling decadent that day.. and when running late for a party.. you can always know that AJ's will have a quick run in and grab plant or beauty of bouquet .. :-),1
Still where I generally go about once a week for a good wine.. a great steak.. and the hard to find gourmet.. I just feel good at Aj's... maybe because it reminds me of all the gourmet shops of home.. LOVE Aj's,1
At AJ's you can buy fresh baked pizza. Try it. It's honestly one of best pizza's you will ever have. \nStaff is very nice. Overall great experience.,1
I will miss you.,1
"I have been to 4 or 5 different LA fitness clubs across the Phoenix area, and this club is my favorite by miles.  It isn't the sales staff that makes it great.... LA Fitness is known for having particularly obnoxious sales people and this place is no exception. It is the warm, friendly clientele.  Their mommas taught them how to be nice, and they are doin' a great job of it.\n\nEvery time i take the time to say hello, I end up meeting warm wonderful people.  I have been in other locations where I feel like my presence is just an annoyance to the macho grunt heavy specimens staring at themselves in the mirror. You won't find that at this location.    And the friendly atmosphere is genuine, not meet market.  I have met very nice people of all ages, both genders, and probably many orientations.\n\nI may not be fond of the sales staff, but the kids who work the counter and the maintenance staff are top notch.  Couldn't be nicer or more efficient.\n\nThe facility is one of the cleanest I have ever been in, and the layout of the club comfortable and efficient.  The cardio is spaced close enough to talk with the people around you, but not so close that you have to climb over them to use it.  There are TVs with FM transmitters within view of most of the second level, and the club below is visible as well.  There are trainers available to help, and there is a juice bar that has bottled water if I forget my own.  I've never used the handball courts, but i see a lot of people there using them every time I am there.\n\nI wasn't real crazy about their spin class.  The whole philosophy of spin is to spin, not pump on the hardest gear possible.  Spin is supposed to be effective for people with knee issues, and it would seem to me that pushing the hardest gear possible contradicts that philosophy.  There are plenty of other classes to take if that is what you prefer.",1
"I visited this location for the first time last week. It's cramped because its \""""under construction\"""". Go to the PV Mall location its much better.",0
"Attention teen-dream girls working the front desk: customer service is meant to involve the customer, not exclude them. Stop your conversation with each other or put down your iPhone and say hi. Don't just grab my keys and avoid eye contact with the members. \n\nThe facility itself is great but the people or should I say kids working there need work. Try smiling and making eye contact. I would like to commend the class instructors, they are nice but only mean when needed to motivate of you catch my drift.\n\nService Level - 2 stars (raised due to trainers / instructors)\nFacility (excluding the \""""teen dreams\"""") - 4-5 stars",0
"On the upside, they have a lot of equipment, services, and classes. They offer it at a great price and the hours are convenient, however for working 3rd shift the classes I would want to do aren't offered early enough for me.\n\nDownside was offered a free hour of personal training when I signed up. Once the personal trainer found out I had no plans to continue personal training, they had no interest in me and were very dismissive.\n\nThe BIG Downside and reason I'll never go there again. The only payment they accept is automatic withdrawals from my checking account/credit card. Was going out of state for a few months and wanted to cancel my membership. Went in and they refused to cancel it there... even though I signed up there. They stated I had to fill out a form and send it to the California office. Sent it out and was still getting charged. Repeated the process. Still got charged. After the third time and me STILL getting charged, closed my checking account against them. \nThen they had the nerve to threaten to send me to a collection agency for not paying the bill. I stated they could go ahead, I'd be happy to take it to court and get my money back for the months of them billing me after I initially tried closing the account. Found out later, LA Fitness has a policy that anyone who tried to close the account and doesn't send it certified mail, they just throw the letters away. I know they've had a few class action lawsuits against them, and can't remember if this was one of them.",0
"I wish you could leave a rating with 0 stars, because that is the quality of service you receive with LA Fitness!  \n\nWhere to start really...Monitor your account, they will try to double charge your account, and make charges to your account that they can't even explain themselves what the charges are from.  Front desk is extremely rude so forget about asking any questions to the members that work there.  Direct all your questions and complaints to the GM who is never there, and who never returns your phone calls.  I could go on forever on this, but review space here is limited and my main focal point of frustration is their kids care service.\n\nPlease, I repeat PLEASE do not bring your child here.  If you love your child and care for their well being (as most parents do), do NOT bring your child here.  The people that are paid to watch over and take care of your children do not even interact with them or watch them.  Instead you can find them sitting in a corner playing on their cell phones or having inappropriate conversation in front of your children with other employees.  If your child has any kind of altercation they discipline them by yelling at them and sending them to a corner until you pick them up.  Now I don't mind disciplining my child my self when my daughter gets in trouble but I will be damned if someone else does it.  If there is a problem the parent should be contacted immediately and let them resolve the issue.  We provide the gym with both of our cell phone numbers that are with us at all times, and the part of the gym that we never leave.  There should be no excuse not to contact the parent as soon as any kind of altercation takes place.  A parent should never have to pick up their child who is crying uncontrollably, especially when the employees can't even tell you how long she was \""""in timeout\"""" for.\n\nWhen picking up your child, you do not even have to provide any kind of identification, they go based on a \""""we know what you look like\"""" policy.  I mean come on we live in a city of over 4 million people, the odds that there are a few others who resemble me can be quite high.  As a parent would you feel safe that just anyone can pick up your child without any kind of identification based on another employees assumption of who you are?\n\nThis place is hell, avoid it like the plague and do not waste your money here.  If you have no other alternatives just please avoid their child care services...",0
"Club had a great remodel.  But its going down hill really fast.  The mgmt is not friendly, and most of the personal training staff scare me to death.  I have seen one personal trainer who seems to know how to be a proper Trainer.  So if you go there ask for Frank(He's on top of his game), pretty much most everyone else you are putting your own safety at risk  The GM prides himself on telling people if they don't like something they just have the option to go somewhere else.  Not to bag on everyone there, some of the front desk staff greet you with a smile and try the best they can, but it's pretty easy to see it starts up top.  So I guess you get what you pay for-",0
"For the price, you can't beat this gym. It's one of the larger locations, so even at peak times you'll still be able to lift, hit the treadmill, or find an elliptical machine. The prices are super reasonable and the equipment is in good working order. They also offer tons of classes from Zumba to yoga. If you're looking to join a gym, I recommend this one. I've been with them for years.",1
"As a swimmer, I was looking for a club with a pool on my way to work.  This pool is small, no lane markers, no flags, only 3 lanes and hot water. After only a few lengths and I'm sweating.  This morning the chemicals were so strong that it burned to breathe and so I had to get out.  Then on to the locker room where, after taking a COLD shower, I am sweating profusely the entire time I get ready for work.  Honestly it isn't worth the $30 a month but my choices are slim. Anyone know of better pools in the area??",0
"So, I have been really wanting a gym membership and I finally made it in to check it out.  I was looking for a gym that has lots of classes and a good amount of cardio machines.  L.A. Fitness seemed like a great fit.  It is really hot outside today and I was dying to work out.  I figured L.A. Fitness had something where I could do a trial period so I could work out and see how I liked it. I want to make sure I feel comfortable working out there.  If I liked it I would sign up. This sounds reasonable right?\n\nBasically, what happened was the guy at the front desk told me...NO, I had to sign up, pay sign up fee plus monthly membership fee then if I didn't like it they would give my money back.  Also, if I didn't sign up today it would cost me more money.  He kept throwing all sorts of numbers at me and talking fast so that I couldn't keep the numbers straight, he wouldn't write anything down for me so I could see how much all this would end up costing me and think about it.  It was like trying to buy a used car.  I hate high pressure sales.  \n\nAlso, to insult to injury he said,...\""""You look good  but you really need to tone up a bit.\""""  Really?  Your going to insult me to get me to sign up for your membership today?  I think this is a terrible sales tactic.  NEVER do I spend money ANYWHERE that insults me.  The only reason I currently do not have a gym membership is this sales tactic.  So, in a nut shell I just walked out and will never go back.  \n\nIf you like high pressure sales and some guy commenting on your body, pointing out how tone you are or not,  commenting on how many inches you need to loose, then this is your place.  As for me I really hope to find a gym that is not like this.",0
"I have been a member of this gym since before it opened and I am quitting now. This gym has become an absolute dump. The membership has been allowed to increase to a level that makes the place absolutely packed in the evenings. There is absolutely no discipline enforced to members who do not follow the rules, such as putting weights back on the racks, wiping down machines after use, filling the weight room with personal bags and \""""other junk\"""". The place is an absolute tip in the evenings. I made a complaint to one of the 3 \""""Managers\"""" today about the increasing number of members, and he simply responded by saying that they have to get their quotas up, that was it. No consideration was givens to anything I said to him \""""We have to get our quotas up!!!\""""\nI need to find a good gym that has some level of concern for the customer, so any recommendations are welcome. LA Fitness you are doomed!\nI tried to do zero Stars but it wouldn't let me.",0
"I have had my membership at LA Fitness for almost two years now.  I did not attend often at first because I was unsure how to use the weights and machines, so after saving up some money I enrolled in personal training with Jake.  He was a phenomenal trainer and motivated me to push myself and keep coming back.  After two months with this trainer, he was promoted to \""""master trainer\"""" which, unfortunately for me, meant it would cost me more. I reluctantly accepted to stay in his schedule since I was seeing great results with him. Two months later, he left LA fitness to pursue something else.\n\nSo, I called LA fitness a week or two later and asked to be placed back into a regular trainer's schedule back at the old rate that I was at, because going up to the master trainer rate was hard on me financially. I spoke with Ashleen, the personal training manager, and she said that would not be a problem and from here on out I would go back to the old rate and I could see John for personal training.\n\nMy next payment went through for the master training rate, so I called Ashleen again and after many unreturned phone calls I finally got ahold of her and she informed me that there is just something I have to sign in order to clear the new agreement at which point she will credit me back the difference to my account.  I went in and signed the necessary form and still it he next month I was still charged at the old rate!!!!! So, this is two months I am getting overcharged. I, again, called Ashleen numerous times without a response.\n\nI decided at this point that I needed to call corporate. I called them and they told me I still needed to sign the agreement (that I had already signed four weeks prior at this point). I explained the situation and I was told to go in and speak with Prague this time.\n\nI walked in and Prague was available who gave me the form to sign and it was clear that I would be credited back the past three months of overcharges.  I asked when I should expect to be credited back and he said the next Monday or Tuesday (which was five days away to account for the 4th of July holiday weekend).\n\nIt is now July 14th and I still have not seen a penny back of the past three months I have been overcharged. My whole family and many of my friends attend this gym and I will be sure to tell them about this experience because clearly the staff here cares only about if they are getting their money and nothing else. As soon as my contract is up I will look into personal training somewhere else and so will everyone in my family.",0
"This location is a joke! \n\nI canceled my membership 2 weeks ago and unfortunately I had to escalate my problem to corporate. I canceled online and had the option of mailing the cancelation form or dropping it off by 5 pm. I went in and the manager Parag wasn't there, he went home early. So I left it with someone else who assured me Parag would do it first thing in the morning -keep in mind this guy never asked why I was canceling my membership, never asked to see what they could do to get me to stay, just said ok I'll give it to him. A little after noon the next day I called to find out the hold up. Parag said it's up to him if it gets canceled and he needs to review it first. IT'S NOT UP TO YOU! At no point does anyone within this company get to decide if I'm canceling my membership. I'm not under a contract. I paid my first and last months up front. You have my money and I'm not giving you anymore. He was unbelievably rude and condescending, he kept interrupting me and was clearly stationed on his high horse. \nSo I called corporate who instantly canceled my membership. \n\nThe reasons I canceled:\n\nGood luck working out between the hours of 5-7 during the week, you will wait and wait and wait to use any non-cardio machine. If you wanna prance on a treadmill chances are you can get one easily. But, if you're into strength training...good luck! \n\nMy biggest problem with this gym is the hours. They close at 8 on Sundays and 10 Fridays and Saturdays. Seriously?? \n\nThe sales reps they call personal trainers are pushy and rude. I was told by corporate they are able to sell individual training courses but according to the folks here they can only do the one year training membership...stop lying to your customers!!",0
"Man, I hate this location!! I've been going to la fitness for 10+ years now and never had a problem. I recently moved next to this location and was excited to start training here since it's almost twice the size of the other la fitness i was going too. \n\nAfter training here for a month I've had enough! \n#1Every time I walk in this place there is always one or two male workers flirting with the girl who scans you in giving me the dirtiest look. \n#2 YOU CANT BRING A GYM BAG IN THE GYM???? This is the only la fitness I've seen that does this. I'm a pretty serious lifter and there are certain things I need with me (straps, belt, chalk) let alone my keys phone and wallet. Usually I bring my bag anyway but within a few minutes management will ask me to remove it or leave it in the locker room which is on the other side of the gym. I've asked the manager why they do this he claims it keeps the floors clear but if I bring every individual thing in my bag in the gym apparently that's ok (wtf!)\n#3 The hours suck. They close at 10 on Friday and 8 on Saturday and Sunday. This is also the only on la fitness I've seen do this.\n\nApparently this location goes by it's own rules which is it's downfall. I'm more than happy to drive to a further location than to go to this pos gym.",0
"What a great gym! I was with 24 hour for the longest time. Thank goodness I made the switch. It is so clean in here. It's also the biggest one around since it's so new. The staff is very friendly and not overly pushy about sales. Of course they're gonna try. That's their job. They offer great classes, a juice bar, wet area, and a sauna in the locker room.",1
"DON'T BRING YOUR CHILDREN HERE!!! I BEG YOU!!! Parag Sampat, manager is a creep. \n\nToday I walked in and forgot my scan card so the worker at the front immediately was not willing to work with us and look up our account or photo in the system. We then proceeded to tell them that this is the first time we are here with our 5 year old and wanted to try out the play place. We are trying to give money to these people and have them watch our kid and he says to me \""""Well you know the kid zone is only open for another 45 minutes right?\"""" Hmmm... seems like a rude response. \n\nWe then are given a waiver that is required for our son to enter the play zone.. the man chuckles at me and says, \""""THATS JUST INCASE WE DECIDE TO THROW YOUR KID AROUND.\""""\n\nI ask for his manager, he smiles and says he's the manager. My husband says he needs to give us the number for whoever is in charge of him and he resists giving us any info to contact his boss. Finally he handed us a phone number and we filed an official complaint. Unfortunately we live near Anthem and there aren't any other locations close to us or we would have relocated.",0
"I have started going here and really enjoy this place. This is the biggest LA Fitness in the area, therefore it is always crowded but never had any issues with getting on the machines I needed to use. I have not had issues with the gym at all. No issues with getting onto the machines, smell issues or rude management.",1
"I want to pretend that I don't need a fancy gym. I want to pretend that a reasonable rate for access to many gyms in the city is worth it.\n\nLet me add a note that I have lost 45 lbs on my own. I do not have a problem with motivation, pain, early workouts, blisters, or sweat.\n\nWhat I don't like about this gym?\n\nThey had a renovation that took quite awhile. I can't comment on what it looked like before because I hadn't been inside. So this is just my observation, post reno:\nThe $ went to new Corian locker room countertops, new lockers, and a smoothie cafe. I say this with confidence, because:\nThe cardio machines aren't new. Old iPod jacks and half the TVs don't work. The level of gritty funk in the grooves is so disgusting, that couldn't have been recent. You can pick a treadmill, a bike, a single level elliptical (you can't adjust the incline), or a stair climber. 15 years ago at a now defunct racquetball club, I could pick an elliptical that had an adjustable incline. So I can't fathom why the lack of selection here.\n\nThe weight machines are standard, at best. Not one piece of newer looking muscle builders. Plenty of broken ones. The most popular machines have only one of it's type, but there are countless weight benches. \n\nIt's often crowded, members are oblivious to other members waiting, there's never a staff person in sight, lacking in paper towel stations, and it's a horrible place for a female to go alone if she doesn't want to be bothered, as I have observed. Dudes to chicks are like 9-1 ratio, at any time of day. Le sigh....\n\n\n I was scammed into an initiation fee. Don't let them pressure you. They ALWAYS have deals that are better than what I got. \n\nThe 2 stars are for being a gym with a decent location.\n\nI resentfully will be returning, until I can go to greener pastures.",0
"This is by far the shittiest customer service I've ever received. When I inquired about signing up I asked a man from personal training and before he could open his mouth to answer some woman, who I assume was his boss pulled him over and yelled at him about his sales quota...in front of me! I was horrified that someone would direct their employees in such a manner especially I'm front of potential customers and on the floor!!! That broad needs a reality check!",0
"I posted a review on this gym a while back and found out recently that someone from LA Fitness actually had YELP pull a picture of the HUGE cancellation penalty I received from LA Fitness from the site.  It was a photo of the me holding the actual cancellation form.  It was over $700 dollars!  This wasn't a payment for back payments, or anything like that.  It was a \""""cancellation penalty\"""" for not wanting to go to LA fitness anymore.  \n\nWhen I stopped by the club to cancel my membership, they pulled out the contract showing that they had the right to charge me hundreds and hundreds of dollars!  It was INSANE!  I went in to cancel my membership and they wouldn't let me out of the contract unless I paid them money.  LA Fitness is a total SCAM operation and somehow YELP is helping them out in the process.\n\nAnd SHAME on you YELP for removing something that shows how LA Fitness screws people over... not just for a few bucks but for HUNDREDS of dollars.  \n\nIf I posted a picture of a crappy job a roofer job, or a bad carpet installation job at my house, or a photo of a sloppy meal at a restaurant, you wouldn't pull that - small businesses evidently don't get any special treatment.  So, what's up with you pulling a picture of the actual BILL I received from LA Fitness (big corporate company) showing how they screw people? Any special advertising deals you have going with them that you don't want to ruffle?\n\nAll that crap about YELP wanting you to know that you can TRUST them, and that they won't change your review is pure bullshit.  Someone from LA fitness made a phone call to someone at YELP and said that they really didn't want a picture of my cancellation penalty on their YELP page because it would make them look bad... and YELP pulled it!  They actually pulled it and sent me a little note that said, sorry... we have been asked by LA Fitness to pull this.  Evidently I can write about the cancellation penalty, but I can't take a picture of the actual bill proving it.  And that makes sense?  Me thinks not.\n\nAvoid this place like the plague... and also know that YELP does in fact work with companies you review if the company has some clout and complains about a specific review.  Yelp will modify, or pull a bad review.",0
I understand contracts. I understand cancellation  policies. Long story short they didn't receive my mailed cancelation notice ( they wouldn't let me cancel in office for some reason that day). That's my fault I should not rely on someone else to do their job. So I canceled at the moon valley location in person. Plus I cancelled my credit card but they have some agreement with capital one that allowed them to access my new account ??!!  so I continued to pay for kids club/daycare  while I was not a member. The club is overpriced unless you need a pool or want  to pay too much for one on one training. Try fitness1 at 7th street and union hills. I pay yearly and including daycare/group fitness it is around $15 a month.  The more you pay for the gym isn't going to get you more in shape.,0
As always LA fitness guys won't let you cancel it with the usual manager not there story. The girl in the front desk(jan 2nd 8:10 pm duty girl) is so rude.,0

We were told by the owner that \""""it would cost us\"""" and he pointed to the wall behind us where Scotch packing tape w/dispensers and rolls of thicker tape with out a dispensers were hanging. Fine. We don't usually expect to have to pay for tape since every other store offers it for free for people to pack items themselves.

Those tapes have cutting dispensers there.\"""" We could tell this guy clearly didn't want to give us an inch of courtesy and the reason was unclear. We were nothing but pleasant to him.

I am a totally different person thanks to his amazing technique.\n\nAt first, I was skeptical as he is not like the traditional - snap, crackle and pop chiropractors.  I felt like with them I was constantly having to go several times a week for months on end; which was difficult and the pain always returned.  In the beginning with Dr. Albert I went a couple times a week and instantly felt amazing.  He explained it would take my body some time to get used to the technique and after a couple of weeks I was pain free.  I now only need to see him maybe once a month to keep things in shape and am amazed at how differently I feel.  \n\nI would highly recommend this highly gifted to man to everyone!!!",1
"I fell 26 feet off a telephone pole 7 years ago, doctors want to sedate me and eventually do surgery. My only relief has been in the form of narcotics for 7 years. I met Dr. Albert three days ago and had my first treatment. When I learned there would be no cracking or popping I was very skeptical and excited. Since my first visit my pain has all but disappeared. I stopped taking my meds and am practicing moving as he suggests. For the first time ever I am able to walk and sit normally. \n\nDr. Albert is amazing and I am so glad to have met him! What a great experience!",1
I sprained my ankle 1 week before my wedding. I was on crutches and freaking out that I may not be able to walk down the isle. I saw the great reviews on yelp for Dr Alyesh and figured I'd give him a try. He worked his magic and performed acupuncture and I walked out of his office! I was able to walk and dance at my wedding thanks to him!,1
was disappointed that several slightly used pieces i was looking at actually cost more than buying the same item completely new!! thank goodness for smart phones and being able to research things on the spot!! hopefully more consumers start doing that at places like this.,0
"I had quite an awful experience with Suzie's Mama Bear several years back.  It's been a while since it happened (about 7 years ago), but I definitely believe it is a cautionary experience worth sharing. \n\nI am now severnteen, but a while back ago, I used to be enrolled in Suzie's Mama Bear after school. It was just about the worst daycare experience I could describe for a child, but given my age, I was not able to articulate it to anyone. \n\nThe daycare, as I remember it, was a wild mess. Children were swearing all over, and none of the adults there would do anything about it. I had a dietary restriction to where I could not have milk, so my mother personally instructed them not to give me regular milk and brought them the milk substitute I should have drank for during snack time. The lady in charge never even bothered to use it, so I was unknowingly drinking regular milk each day without knowing it and having my health harmed.\n\nOne day, I was pushed by one of the older kids who was at the daycare, as bullying was quite normal there. I fell on my arm the wrong way and broke my wrist in multiple areas. I had to repeatedly ask the adult there to call my mom over the course of an hour before she actually instructed someone to make the phone call. Then, I had to wait about an hour and a half for the staff to actually call my mother because they seemed to view it as low-priority, thinking I may have just hurt myself. By the time I had arrived at the emergency room, it had been over three hours since I broke my wrist. \n\nSince then, I don't know what sort of changes have been made with the daycare, but I wanted to share my perspective. I definitely do not think this is a place anyone should be taking their children.",0
"My daughter has been coming here for about 3 years. She started out in the baby room and is now in the 4 year old class. She absolutely loves it here. Its a small facility so all of the children and staff are close knit which makes her feel very comfortable being dropped off each day. I also like that they give you a chip each day when you pick up your child. You then give that chip to your child's teacher. This ensures that someone that is not on your child's pickup list cannot get your child. There have even been a few times that I wasnt given my chip and I went to retrieve my daughter and even though they know me, they still required me to go back and get one. I really like that they are cautious in that way. Everything they do in class is also based on an age appropriate curriculum. In the 4s classroom they even start doing homework. Absolutely love it.",1
"Crappy Cleaners. I was very disappointed with the way my clothes came back. The shirt with pleats looked like they put it in the dryer, had to take it to a different place to get it done right .",0
I think this is named Cambridge Cleaners now. And it is $2.50 an item. But...having been a dry cleaners daughter I am not impressed. At all. Yes.....you get what you pay for but they are not able to get a simple salad dressing spot out of my husband's polo shirts. It has not been washed or thrown in the dryer which sets stains. It is not laundered- it is supposedly pre- spotted and then dry cleaned. 5 of the 7 had to be returned. I know it can come out. I have taken the very same shirts to another cleaners and voila- not a problem. SO why can't they get it out? I do not recommend and I won't go back.,0
"I really like this place. \n\nI first went here because they are by my house and they had a sign for a spa pedicure for $16.99 and you really can't beat that. My pedicure lasted a month...which is really great!\n\nThe employees here are really nice and they pretty much closed up the shop so that I could get my nails done here with all my bridesmaids for my wedding last month. They are very comptetively priced and they do a great job. \n\nThe only downfall I would give this place is that it is and older building and pretty small, so if they don't have a lot of technicians working you may have to wait awhile.",1
"Great Service.  Only $17 for spa pedicure- I did $5 for callus removal, $5 for design - set of shellac $40.  Very quick, didn't have to wait around.  Good technician.",1
Dangerously dirty!,0
I don't usually get mani-pedi's and my experience here does not make me want to go back.  My manicure and spa pedicure was all of 30 minutes and cost $34 with tip.  In the past I have spent about an hour or more at other salons.   I probably will try another place when I decide to do this again.,0
Rushed and poor quality.,0
I was rushed! The whole time. My pedicure took 13 min they didnt push my cuticle I asked not to trim my nails. They trimmed my freaking nails!!!  I went back and for between 2 people like they wer tag teaming my pedicure.  By far the worst ive ever had. 3 days later my polished looked like crap and my cuticles wer not trimmed or pushed,0
"I've been coming here for a while now & love how fast & efficient they are. I can get in and out quickly, I like the family that runs the place. The TV is great, always playing the news, which beats music. Definitely not a place for frills, but for someone with a busy schedule this is the place to go.",1
"I have been getting mani/pedi's for the last 30 years and this was by far the worst I have ever had.  First, I have nevery had a 10 spa pedicure, this woman was so fast and had no attention to detail.  It wasn't like there was anyone else in the place.  She spent almost no time on my feet with a pumice stone, maybe three seconds per foot unless you paid the up-charge for the callus remover.  When I got home I clipped my own toe nails straight as I think she was trying to make them in the shape of a mountain range.  Next time, I will go back to my pretty little nail salon on Northern and 12th and drive the extra couple of miles for a fantastic mani/pedi.",0
"I gave one star bc I HAD to. I have never in my life been to such an unprofessional place in my life.  I'll spare the name of my \""""stylist\"""" but why, idk. bottom line is, if you can't cut hair right, don't cut someones hair!!  I'll stick to letting the professionals at Honeycomb Organic Hair Salon  do my cutting from now on. How hard could it possibly be to trim BANGS?! THEY'RE ALREADY PARTED SHAPED! My bangs look disgusting and I'm not going to let that hack job TRY to fix them. Bs!",0
Took care of me even though I didn't give them much to go on.  I appreciate the patience every time I'm here.,1
"I think that it is difficult to differentiate between Lexus service centers as they all adhere to to relatively high standards, but I have to say that Bell Lexus is a a pure pleasure to have my car serviced at.  Like most dealerships I was not only able to book my appointment online but also able to get the first time and date I requested.  When you get to the covered service drive, you are always greeted and walked into your service consultant.  I work with Debi at Bell Lexus and she not only gets everything processed and my car in for service quickly but also always has a loaner ready to go.  This time it was a 2010 RX which made the fiancee happy because she is looking at one as her next car possibly.  It gave us the perfect opportunity to drive it around for the morning and see if it was something that we truly liked. I think we are in trouble because we both definitely thought it was a great car for her.  Back to the service though. I had my car in at 8:30 am and I had a call by noon that my 15,000 mile service was not only done but also my brakes had been replace (under warranty) at no extra charge.  I was back in my car (which they also washed) by 1:30 in the afternoon and on my way.  Overall, great service and experience.",1

"We bought a 2011 Lexus at Bell.  Our sales associate was very professional and knowledgeable.  Unfortunately, the finance manager was right out of a movie.  A typically use car salesman attitude and persona.  He tried to take advantage of us both on our trade and lease.  I will never buy another vehicle from Bell Lexus.  Next time Scottsdale Lexus.  Buyer beware.",0
"Their service department ripped me off. I brought RX330 in for a blown engine fuse that should have been covered by the extended warranty. The service writer called me and told me that it was not and I had to pay for it. She then told me the fuse was INSIDE the engine. They charged me over THREE hours for this repair, but didn't get my prior authorization for the repair cost. When I went to pick it up and argued with them about the cost, they told me I had to pay it or they would hold my car until I did.  Do not ever take your Lexus there for service. I feel that they lied to me and held my car hostage until I paid $400 for a $50 repair.",0
"This review is solely on the sales department ~\n\nSo it has been about 10 years since I last purchased a vehicle.  I have had 2 Nissans, 2 Acuras, and none Toyota/Lexus that I want to give it a try.  So I stopped by Bell Lexus North Scottsdale right down the street from my house.  I thought since this dealership moved from Phoenix to Scottsdale, their attitudes would be better and have higher quality of service, oh, was I totally wrong about this.\n\nTo begin the whole process, I've been in communication with one of their customer service rep over the Internet about what I want in my car, we kept writing e-mails back and forth to each other with the changes and exactly what I'm looking for.  One day on my day off, I stopped by the dealership for the first time.  There wasn't many people looking in their lot, one of the sales rep came out and I told him I was looking for a gal which would remain nameless because it's not important in this case.\n\nThen this gal introduced me to the product specialist that serves as sales rep as well.  He went through everything with me, trying to find me the color that I had previous talked to this gal about, and then he told me, I'm sorry, but the car you want is no longer available to you.  So I asked to see another similar vehicle and asked for a test drive.  He said he'll drive the car off the lot and let me drive the rest of the way.  I thought he meant he'll just drive the car out of the dealership and park it at the near-by street for me to take over.  No, he drove the car for like 5 minutes and about 2 miles away from the dealership before letting me take control of the vehicle.  What type of test drive was that?  Is he afraid that I might wrack the car or he is not sure if I know how to handle a Lexus?\n\nBack to the dealership after the worst test drive ever, we sat down to talk numbers.  He talked to his manager while I sat at his desk waiting for him.  He would not give me the final cost on how much I would need to pay, instead, he asked for $3,000 to locate the car that I requested with the gal earlier from another dealership.  Seriously, why the heck do you think I would give you $3,000 to locate the car for me when you can't even give me the final number on the car.  You can't be serious.  That's not how you want people to buy car from you.  Instead I think they are driving people away from their dealership since people are very afraid to go shop there.\n\nI have purchased the vehicle I want from Earnhardt Scottsdale Lexus.\n\nSeriously people, STAY AWAY FROM THIS DEALERSHIP.",0
"After visiting Earnhardt Lexus looking at the ES300h but not really getting serious I went to Bell Lexus thinking they would have a better selection.  They didn't but I took a test drive anyway. \nAfter a short test drive we sat down to go over the numbers.  I was unimpressed with the negotiations.  Although they were polite, they seemed relatively dysfunctional.  Earnhardt had mentioned incentive financing which oddly the Bell Lexus folks couldn't or wouldn't match.\nI went back to Earnhardt and got the car I wanted at a better price, with the financing Bell didn't (wouldn't) offer, and a better deal on my trade-in.  \nTo summarize, Bell Lexus was not really competitive on price, financing, or trade-in, but other than that they were OK.",0

Not sure how to explain it other than, your expecting pork ribs, but got beef maybe?  Not sure what these were. \n\nThe new potatoes. Were a bit crunchy like they were under cooked. The plastic fork broke off in the first one. \n\nThe bottom layer of the cake was dried out, and not moist like the rest of the cake.

This was before I tried eating the food so they were unaware of the other issues. Couple days later I did get a call from corporate regarding the drink, and they were only concerned if I was making a claim against BM for the damages. I said no, I cleaned it up myself, I was only making a comment as they might have an issue with their cups.  But I did take a moment to comment about the meal, and was advised I'd get a follow up call.   That was several days ago.  Don't bother, I've already made up my mind about my future purchases with BM. They will be limited.",0

"Unsanitary, unsafe and extraordinarily shady and dishonest.  \n\nSherry's Pampered Pets should be shut down.\n\nWe used Sherry's for boarding for about 1 1/2 years. Two very disturbing incidents led us to stop.\n\nFirst--we asked to use their restroom.  When we first started going to Sherry's we asked to tour the facilities. We were told that due to liability issues, they could not give us a tour, but we could look at the play areas through the outside windows.  We thought this was a little strange since every single other kennel we've ever been to was willing (and wanted) to give us a tour. We figured we had no reason not to trust them so we accepted their excuse. Fast forward 1 1/2 years-- I desperately needed to use a restroom.  They didn't want to let me use it at first, but I told them it was an emergency and they let me. Quickly learned why they did not want to let me back there or give customers tours of the facilities.  The closed off area, that they don't want customers touring, is unbelievably, phenomenally filthy. And that's an understatement. I have never seen a dirtier restroom in even the seediest, filthiest truck stop gas station I have ever been to.  More importantly--they had stacks of kennels that looked like they came from a puppy mill.  They only place i have ever seen such dirty kennels and such a filthy facility is in those gut-wrenching puppy mill videos you see on SPCA or PETA.  It should be criminal to be running such a disgustingly filthy boarding operation.\n\nSecond--We went on an extended vacation (about two weeks). When we returned, our dog looked very tired and skinny.  The owner's sister (the older lady with the tattoos) informed us that our dog had not been eating anything for almost the entire stay at the kennel and she had consistent diarrhea for same amount of time.  We asked her if they made any attempt to call us or a veterinarian and she confirmed that nobody from Sherry's Pampered Pets did so at any time. At least 1-2 weeks of diarrhea and lack of appetite and not a single person at Sherry's bothers to call us or take our dog to a vet. We confirmed this story 3 times with this lady (because we were so shocked and could not believe the level of neglect). Short of our dog dying, I can not think of a much more extreme case of kennel negligence.  This situation should be (and possibly is) criminal neglect.  \n\nWe returned to Sherry's within a few days to speak with Sherry.  When we did, her sister had completely changed her story (or so Sherry says).  Sherry claimed that her sister told her that our dog was sick for only the last 1-2 days of boarding. We asked Sherry to bring her sister out so we could confront her with her lie and Sherry refused.  Sherry's adult daughter then got in our face, yelling at us for \""""accusing\"""" her aunt of lying (which she blatantly did). Needless to say, Sherry refused to refund our money or pay or veterinarian bills.\n\nShort of our dog dying, we could not think of a more egregious, disturbing situation of animal neglect by a boarding kennel.\n\nNot only did Sherry's completely violate our trust, they abusively (and possibly criminally) neglected our dog.\n\nI really can not find the words to express how phenomenally disgusted and outraged we were over this case of extraordinary dishonesty, abuse and disturbing conduct by Sherry, her sister and her daughter.",0
"I wish that I could have got ahold of Sherry's Pampered Pets so that I could have made the reservation that I needed. But after 2 attempts at contacting them by phone and leaving them a voicemail that never got returned, I never even got as far as making the reservation. I waited 3-4 days for a return phone call, and then made reservations elsewhere. If I can't even get ahold of anyone or get a return phone call after leaving a voicemail, I am sure not leaving my dog with you.",0
"I love this place and so does my dog, Shelby! The staff is very friendly and attentive to Shelby. She goes here everyday for doggy day care, we have boarded her a few times while on vacation & she also gets her nails trimmed here. They do a great job with all of the above. The first time we boarded her, she lost some weight, but I think it's because she wasn't used to the environment overnight & was so busy playing she just didn't eat. The last few times, she's had no problem eating since she's so comfortable there. She's always excited to go inside when we pull up in the car and greets the staff excitedly. I highly recommend to anyone!",1
"I had a wonderful first experience here!! I have two Australian cattle dogs and this was there first time to the groomer, they loved it!! They came back with a shiny coat, nails trimmed and less hair (I asked for them to brush out the undercoat)! The price was awesome too!! I looked all day and kept being quoted 50-70 for each dog! When I called sherry I was quoted 30 per dog and they got me in within two hours! I will be back once a month for my pups!!",1

"Frequent visitor of this location. Usually a little bit of a line but manageable.

I couldn't give them the last star b/c they were out of a few items we attempted to order (the menu selection is pretty small) the alternates were still tasty though. But it seems like the type of place that has mastered everything on the menu so I don't think you can go wrong. The owner was very friendly -like kiss on the hand friendly :/ awkward. Anyway they are a little pricier than olive garden but well worth it, especially if you've got a coupon. Bottom line: it was tasty and I will probably be back.",1
"I saw amazing reviews on Yelp, so decided to go here.  I left very confused how these reviews came about.\nWe ordered cocktails, which were tasty.  We also ordered an appetizer, carpaccio.  We promptly received that and bread.  Those were both fine.  We waited what seemed like an eternity for our server to come back to our table to order.  I watched him go to every table around us a couple times while we received our appetizer, ate it, and a busser took the plate before I flagged him down so we could order.  \nMy friend ordered the lasagna, which tasted like a Wendy's cheeseburger.  Seriously, my friend said try it and tell me what fast food it tastes like.  I laughed and then tasted it to find it tasted exactly like a double stack, but 10 times the price.  I ordered the pollo salute that was described as chicken topped with marscapone, prosciutto, and a brandy mushroom sauce.  I didn't find any marscapone or prosciutto on top, but there was a mushroom sauce that reminded me of Campbell's Cream of  Mushroom soup.  I was certain they followed the recipe on the can.  I had a side of penne pasta covered in the bland marinara and vegetables.  The vegetables were good.  I didn't really understand the pasta in marinara since the chicken had a sauce already on it.  Why the two completely different sauces?\nI asked for more bread to fill myself up because I didn't want to finish my food and it was taken away after I ate one piece.  It was terrible service and since I used a restaurant.com gift certificate, gratuity was automatically added on.  The food was terrible.  How did it get all these great reviews?  It was like one of our exes was the chef that night and wanted us to have the worst meal ever.  I don't know how else to explain the the huge difference between what we experienced and what has been written on Yelp.",0
"Yech. I wanted to give it one star but my son said that was too harsh. \n\nThe garlic bread was good, and the mussels were really good. But the Mediterrean chicken was way overcooked and  hard. My salmon was thin, overlooked, and fishy.  The house salads were passable. \n\nI think we dropped about $60. It was definitely not worth it.",0
"Husband ordered calamari,  tasted like the oil was very old.   Watched waiter bring our food to table next to us and then take it back to kitchen..then they brought us both salads with OLD, BROWN lettuce.    Seriously, that was a first for me.  I have never been served spoiled lettuce at a restaurant.     Hubby had salmon and said the flavor was good.   I had stuffed pork loin special which was good, with the exception of the \""""side\"""" of pasta with pink, disgusting sauce on it.   What a disappointment.",0
We would not dine there again.  The food was bland and flavorless.  The atmosphere and pasta weren't bad.  My husband also said the espresso wasn't bad.  I think they cater to the over 65 crowd.,0
"When we were seated, the first thought I had was that the restaurant had a surprisingly excellent sound system with a wonderful selection of moody, bluesy music. Then lo and behold, I realized it was live music! A talented man on a keyboard and a woman with a great voice provided a wonderful background to a memorable evening of dining. \n\nI had the Veal Toscana. If this was not the best veal I have had in my life then it certainly was the best veal in the last 25 years. My husband had Shrimp Risotto and he was enthusiastic it as well. The entrees came with a perfectly dressed salad made with a balsamic vinaigrette that was not the usual dressing overwhelmed by the vinegar. They must have used a white balsamic because it was so subtle. For dessert we had spumoni which came encased in chocolate and was delicious and rich...nothing like my vapid spumoni from my youth in the 50's.\n\nOh we will return for sure!",1
Went there last night and it was excellent as always.  We enjoyed the stuffed pork tenderloin special and the friendly service.  Great local place.,1
"Ate here this evening, food was just ok.  The service was very slow and the help was not that friendly.   To top it all we had a Restaurant.com certificate, which states to \""""tip\"""" on the whole amount which we normally do, but the waitress, Jennifer took it upon herself to add the gratuity of 20% of the entire bill with the tax.  She was not worth 20%.  We just paid and left will never go back.  The lasagna tasted like \""""Greek\"""" lasagna and had nutmeg in the sauce.  My chicken was dry.  Disappointed.",0
"Unfortunately, the live music, great service and food that made Salute rise above the hundreds of other little Italian places in the Valley seem to be gone.  The entertainment created an ambience that just made you want to dine here regardless of everything else.  But on our last visit when we were told they were out of the first two things we ordered, early on a Frid. evening, and they had discontinued another dish we requested, we were concerned.  That was followed by really bad service and an awful meal that we picked at and left.  And I feel bad for this place because they will need to really step it up to make up for becoming a \""""Goodwill\"""" strip center and I don't think they can cut it.",0
"bad service from the get go, the only reason why we went here was because a restaurants.com coupon  we had bought, and they just make you feel like you are getting it for free, they do not realize that we paid for the coupon and this is a way to have your restaurant be known, I have another groupon and I rather lose it then go again.",0
"We went here for a birthday expecting it to be good based on the reviews, the restaurant itself is nice but the food was terrible beyond belief. I got the steak from there and when I cut into it, it looked stringing, rough, and disgusting. I couldn't eat it. \nMy family was completely grossed out with their meals. When we went to tell the lady that our meals were terrible she was being sarcastic and very rude, in my opinion she has no respect for customers what so ever and for as nice as restaurant it is I will never go there again.",0
We had the mahi mahi special and butternut squash ravioli.  Both delicious.  Service was very good and liked the atmosphere.,1
DO NOT COME HERE! I'm not sure why this restaurant gets the reviews it does. First off... salmon is not white... its pink.  We spent 25 dollars on the special that was far from special.  Dried out crab stuffed in white chewing salmon. Really?\nThe veal... don't get us started.  Chewy and I'm not convinced it was actually veal. The vegetables on both plates were not even luke warm.  \nGo to Babbo and spend a 3/4 of what we did.  What I'd do to have my 80 plus dollars back!  Summed up... just buy a tv dinner and save the cash!,0
"Wow, don't let the strip mall location fool you.  This lovely diamond in the rough had really good food, a great selection of wine, and a nice quiet atmosphere.  2 people in my party had the t-bone special and I had the Italian chicken in a lemon caper sauce.  I was pleasantly surprised, and would definitely return if ever in the area again.",1
"This has become one of our \""""go to\"""" restaurants... Our favs to order are the mussels in red sauce... the mussels are HUGE always and the marinara type sauce they have them in is better than we literally have found ANYWHER, and it comes with some thin sliced Italian type bread that's been grilled (we ask for more)...we order the saut\u00e9ed spinach with garlic, or a salad have a couple of glasses of red wine and think we're going to turn into mussels after eating this 3-4 times in a month :-)",1
"This place was so great! My friend and I wanted to treat ourselves to a nice dinner and this ended up being the perfect place! We got a discount for checking in, and the food and service was amazing. Definitely recommend the mussle appetizer and clam pasta!",1
"Terrible service & charged me for ceramic brakes, but only gave me lower-quality semi-metallic brakes. After I went to another mechanic to discover the problem, Fletchers still wouldn't fix the problem.",0
"I had to run here on lunch to get my oil changed and 2 tires replaced before i left on a trip the next day to Flagstaff and i couldnt be happier.  The people i spoke with over the phone were very accomodating gave me a great price and most importantly got me in and out on time to work.  I really must say i will go back here again when i get my brakes done, as well any other routine maintence im too lazy to do myself, and back to the tires they beat the price on tires for the same tire everywhere else and had them in stock for me the same day!",1
"One of the worst experiences I've had in a long time with a business. I purchased tires from them with their warranty about 6 months ago. Three months ago one of the tires had a leak. They repaired the tire and sent me on my way after leaving the car there from 10am, they finish repairing the tire at 4 pm. A few weeks later the leak is back. They repair it again, this time I drop it off at 8am and they still finish at 3pm.. Another two weeks and the leak comes back again. Finally they are willing to order a new tire. It takes them two months to get the tire, with me calling them every week to check if it's in. It's funny how when I first wanted to buy the tires they were able to get it the next day, but when they need to stand by their replacement warranty, it takes 2 months. Finally they get it and I drop the car off at 11am on a Wednesday. They do not finish with my car until 3:30pm. I'm pretty sure it doesn't take four and a half hours to change a tire. Will never do business with them again and will warn everyone I know about them.",0
"This place is ridiculous.  I went once for an oil change and they convinced me I needed some other fluids flushed.  I did that.  Thought the service was fine.\n\nNext time I went to get an oil change I was told to make an appointment.  So I called and was told call back another day because they didn't know when they could do it and they don't make appointments.  I asked for a manger, only to find out I was speaking to the manager.  I began to let him know my frustration and was told oh well, tough luck and hung up on.  NEVER will I use these people or ever recommend them to anyone.  Consumer beware!!!",0
Got here at 645 to be first for an oil change took 40 min to get car on rack. 15 minutes in the air to get the oil drained. Watched 3 employees talk about nothing before that even started. No one in lobby to great you and the customer waiting area has garbage in it from Thursday when I dropped in to try and get the oil changed then,0
"COUPONS ARE BOGUS. First time I called to get in for a oil and filter and new wiper blades, with a coupon from FLETCHER'S for the oil change, they said call back after twelve for afternoon appointments. They did not have any.\nSo a few days later I call again and Corey tells me I need to call at 8am for same day, not noon. I mentioned that last time he, Corey, told me to call at noon. \""""Well I'm sorry about that\"""".  My opinion is when a place is incompetent on the phone, it ONLY GETS WORSE.",0
Fletcher's is a joke.... I went there for and oil change and they convinced me to buy 2 get one free. So my total out the door was $40. Well making this next appointment was the worst!!!!! I called everyday at 8am for there stupid same day app. crap and somehow they were already booked for the WHOLE day or didn't answer. I went in to get the refund for my other one I purchase and they would only give me 8$!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! When I should have gotten $20. The guy gave me so much attitude when I said fine I'll take the eight buck. But I have obviously can't get any help from them so it's 8$ or nothing! They also did nothing to try and accommodate the annoying situation they put me in .,0
"If I could give them 0 stars I would. It's not just bad service (and read the reviews, the service is beyond bad, it's insulting) these people are CROOKS. I used to live near one of these places and took my car in for an oil change and to have a squeaky belt replaced. I was told my car needed over $600 of service (too long a list to type here) and that \""""All my belts\"""" needed changing. I said, \""""Oh, really\"""" All of them?\"""" And the mechanic replied \""""Yes, you should do all of them at once, and it's $375.\"""" People, my car has ONE belt. I took it to my regular mechanic and he installed it for free (it took about 10 minutes, and he charged me $20 for the belt!) along with replacing the old oil filter Fletcher's left on the car. RIP OFF WITH A BAD ATTITUDE!",0
"Unlike some of the other reviewers, I had a good experience at this Fletchers. We brought our SUV in for a full inspection since we had just purchased it and it was used. We knew it had some issues due to it's age and wanted to ensure it was fit for driving. The person we got it from said he did all the oil changes himself regularly and maintained it the best he could.\nAfter the Fletchers inspection they did find that most of the regular maintenance items were in great shape as the previous owner had told us... so points for Fletchers for not trying to sell us something we didn't need. \nWe also noticed that the AC wasn't really as cold as we thought it should be... Fletchers suggested a minor repair and added dye to the AC for us to watch. He said if it starts to not blow cold again then bring it back and they would be able to find any leaks that appear. At the end of the day we did have a lengthly list of items that need to be repaired or that will need service soon... he suggested some items we could do ourselves over a weekend as well. \nSo yes, we had to invest into our car for some repairs but overall I feel they were honest about what we really needed, what we could wait on and what we could do ourselves. They also completed all the work in 2 days. He also found some specials for us and saved us about $100.",1
"Horrible and awful are not strong enough words. I have taken my work trucks here a few times due to some groupon coupons, but never again. I took my s-10 in a couple weeks ago. They fixed the seals and said that would fix it. 2 months later I'm still going through a quarter of oil per week. Took the day off work yesterday just to get my truck fixed. Dropped it off at 8:30am. Arrogant guy behind the counter asked \""""what if I can't get it back to you until Monday.\"""" I told him that I'd have to go somewhere else because work starts at 6:30am Monday. He said no problem, he'd give me a call shortly. I called at 3:45 and he said he was going to look at it in the morning. I reminded him of our conversation and he said oh yeah. I then asked if they could do it now and they said no, they close in 15mins, which means I wasn't even going to get a phone call before they closed. \n\nWhen I went in same arrogant guy behind the counter never apologized and said \""""when\"""" I bring it back in he'll waive the $90 diagnostic fee. Give me a break, too arrogant to even apologize. DO NOT GO HERE!!!",0
Do not buy tires from Fletcher.  They do not warrant the tires they sell.  I bought a set of tires with a hazard warranty and the tires began to split.  The tires were manufactured by Firestone.  I researched Firestone tires and they have had major lawsuits and Ford actually dropped them as a supplier just last year.  Firestone had been with Ford for 94 years.  Fletcher would not cover my tires which I purchased less than 2 1/2 years ago because of the splitting of the tire.  I will NEVER buy another tire from Fletcher and neither should you.,0
We bought tires less than 2 1/2 years ago from this Fletcher.  They were Firestone tires which have splitting issues.    They are  now splitting and are not standing by their warranty.  Interesting that Fletcher no longer sells Firestone tires?  That's because they sold us a bad product.  \n\nDO NOT buy tires here.  They do not stand by their product.   Go to Big O or Discount Tire.  I know they warrant their tires.,0
"If I could give ZERO stars I would. I just moved to this area from Ahwatukee and this is my second time coming to this location and THEY ARE THE WORSE. The last time I came for an oil change they told me it was a three hour wait. Today he told me I had 10 people in front of me. I spoke to this Derrick guy and he's rude and unprofessional and lazy. He gave me every reason in the world for why I should come back, why I should leave my car or why it's not good to come on Saturday. I kept saying to him \""""I need an oil change\"""" like regardless of what ur saying I still need an oil change. When I was in Ahwatukee I purchased this \""""Family Plan\"""" that gives you so many free oil changes and discounts etc.  That was great when I lived in Ahwatukee because the Fletcher's out there was AWESOME. However here. I hate it. If I it wasn't for the \""""Family Plan\"""" I wouldn't ever come here for service. Ever. As soon as this runs out I will never return. Horrible horrible place and horrible staff.",0
"I m so frustrated. Should've checked reviews. Been here since 10a (it's now 4) for a rear brake job- rotors and new brakes-- and an oil change. If this isn't 100% perfect when I leave here and everything doesn't feel right, I'm calling corporate. Horrible rude customer service- they take advantage of women. Never coming back.",0
"**Beware** RIP OFF!! do not attemp!!  I went here years back multiple times until they tried to completely rip me off and up charge me over $1100 for stuff that wasn't even wrong or broken on my truck.. I decided to go back because of this new Groupon.. BIG MISTAKE!... after the Groupon they quoted me over $150 bucks than the price that Brakes Plus quoted me, and that was without any kind of Groupon or discount!!",0
"My boyfriend and I took in our 06' Dodge Durango to see if we could get the brakes fixed that day. They were grinding and were not feeling safe at all. When we walked in the guy at the front desk was very impatient with us and talked down to us as though we were children. That by it self was enough to make me want to bolt, I don't take well to being spoken to that way. \n\nBut the worst part was, even after checking he had the parts in stock, he told us he couldn't do it because he was closing in half an hour. Now mind you the sign says they close at 530PM, and it was only 430PM. Doing the front brakes with all the parts available only takes about 45 min. He told me and my boyfriend it would take at least 3 hours and that we HAD to call a head and schedule but he didn't have anything up for about a week or two. So we said no thank you and went to leave. \n\nBut the good news after calling around and some driving we were able to go to Brakes Plus on Tatum and Bell, they were amazing! I called to set up an appointment for the next day with them, but they told us to come on in anyway and they could do it right then and there, even though they closed in less than an hour. They stayed an extra 10 min in the end, just for us. \n\nIt was a huge relief considering once the tires were removed the showed us just how bad it had been. We were driving with no brakes.  No one at Fletcher even looked at our truck. I can't imagine what would have happened if we had waited to schedule a week or two out like he wanted.\n\nBad form Fletcher, bad form.",0
"My dads mechanic normally works on my vehicle but since I have moved I have not found a decent shop to bring my vehicle until fletchers. I brought it in for a simple oil change and of course the 2 salesman showed me several other things that my car was having issues with. I didn't have a whole lot of money to thrown down so he broke down what could waited to be fixed and what needed to be fixed immediately for my safety. He also took the time to explain what synthetic oil was and how it would benefit me in the long run. The salesman Brent really took his time with me and even gave me a small discount on the more expensive oil!!!! I really appreciated the honesty with Fletchers and the ability to help me out so my car could get what it needed! \nThe wait time was also not to bad, I walked to the bakery and had a snack and hung out for a bit and it was done in a decent time.",1
"Can I give a 0 star? The customer service is horrible, slow and they were not being respectful at all, waste of time.  I'd rather pay more and go somewhere else.  Worst service ever.",0
"I've been to their other location at 1219 E Glendale Ave, and the bell location is a lot less tucked away and has a nice patio too if you enjoy outdoor eating. The pizza is consistent with their Glendale Ave location. and if you've never had their pizza before I highly recommend \nit\n\nI could go on and on about growing up in Illinois and eating all the authentic Chicago pizza's. but I won't , because if there's one thing AZ is full of it's transplants bashing the local fare and raving about the food at home.\n\nkeep in mind they serve chicago style thin, which is a change of pace compared to the classic chicago style deep with the layer of sauce on top and the toppings stuffed in the middle. Typically with chicago style thin, some of the toppings will be under the cheese and it's generally a sweeter marinara than most are used to.\n\nIf you're not in the mood for pizza I can also recommend the spaghetti calzone which my wife will order from time to time, I recommend ordering this with meatballs.  but personally I'm a sucker for the pizza, also the prices are pretty reasonable and expect to have leftovers unless you've got a real A-game appetite\n\nIf you don't know the story behind Spinato's originally it was under the name Aurelio's which if you've ever been in the chicagoland area is a local family owned favorite throughout the state. and my personal favorite, and one of my \""""we have to eat here\"""" places when I go home to visit.  Aurelios started out in AZ by a relative of the Aurelio family and eventually the family owned franchised took off the aurelios name, but continued to deliver the same high quality pizza under their own name Spinato.\nthe pizza is not verbatim to Aurelios in IL, but it's damn close, damn tasty and good enough to inspire childhood nostalgia and a drive from surprise to 16th st and Bell.\n\nI'm almost a little sad that I didn't discover Spinato's up until last year. My wife has in the past even looked into getting mail order frozen pizza from Aurelios dry ice and absorbinent fees and all. and the closest thing I could find was deno's which was made in  the same style but the flavors were different.  fortunately they like to order this pizza at work and one day I tasted some pizza and was immediately reminded, I looked at the box did some googling and was amazed that they were here all along.\n\nI hope to frequent Spinato's and hope they setup a location further west.",1
"Pizza was much better than I remembered.  Crust came out quite well with just enough crispness and golden color.  Cheese was flavorful, and diced tomatoes were sweet and delicious.  Side of sauce is necessary here because it is so good.\n\nDon't forget to try the Calzones.  I had a small hiccup with service, but otherwise this was a great dining experience and the food is consistently good.",1
"For a city saturated with Little Cesar's, Pizza Hut, Papa John's this place is a welcomed site. I've always had great service and really, really good pizza.  I'm not generally a spinach fan, but their spinach pizza (award winning) has to be the best around.  It would have to take a lot to dethrone this place as my favorite pizza joint.  Their cheesy garlic bread is also pretty good.",1
Hands down the Best Pizza in town!  Best Sausage...Mmmm!,1
"Must say this is the best pizza I've tasted in the valley!\n\nWent here Friday night with my husband and we were in the mood for something naughty... we found it..     We ordered \""""The Super Six Pizza\"""", which is sorta the combo they have....    As soon as I saw it I thought, Come here you little slice of heaven..spank, spank....     I think it was a little of everything that made this pizza for me...   The sauce was sweet and had a lot of tasty flavor.  The toppings were the perfect amount and you could actually taste all the different flavors of the meats while eating them.  The cheese was plentiful and the medium pizza for the two of us was more then enough.  You can really taste the love that was put into this pie.  I think it was the owner or chef, or both that came out and greeted everyone on the porch chit chatting with everyone to make it feel more homely.  \n**** Yes I think my search for a fabulous pizza is over with, I woke up the next morning craving it...  ****  Must return, and must return soon.",1
This place is awesome! My favorite is the Garlic Spinach pizza.,1
"I rarely visit a restaurant where the service stands out to the point that it deserves an update to the five star review I already gave it. While visiting Spinatos recently, I couldn't help but notice how very friendly the restaurant staff. Immediately upon entering, we were greeted by a very friendly hostess who showed us to our seats and grabbed us water right away. Then, the second the the hostess left, the waitress appeared and enthusiastically greeted us. The friendly service continued until the moment we left and it left a lasting impression on me. Staff is normally friendly, but the Spinatos staff definitely woke up on the right side of the bed and you can tell that they truly love where they work! Great pizza and great staff! A + Spinatos!",1
"4-5 locations.. all 4.5 star average.. I think Arizona really has some fantastic Pizza options, and Spinatos is at the top of my pizza fix list.. the semi sweet sauce is addictive, great service, fresh ingredients, The Spicy Italian is my favorite... The chocolate chips cookies are laced with mind altering drugs, that make your body parts\""""romantic\"""" when you think of their cookies.. BTW 5:30pm, on a Tuesday, when we left, a 30 minute wait.. Its on the List..",1
"One of my most favorite places! We happened along this place by accident while enjoying a \""""stay-cation\"""" at a local resort. We were starving and not looking to pay resort prices for dinner. A quick little drive and we saw a sign that said pizza. The best accident we had! \nLocation is in a strip mall and not terribly inviting, but go anyway because once you hit the front door it's like you walked into a friends house. Great smell from the kitchen and a small little bar with plenty of good beverages and cold beer. \nSo take a look at the menu, ask for suggestions. The sausage is homemade and fantastic. My favorite crust is the thinner \""""crispier\"""" crust. and there is no expense spared on toppings smothering edge to edge. So if you like to actually enjoy your toppings & sauce not just get a mouthful of dough this is your place. \n\nWord of warning, everything is big! The small salad easily feeds three & do try the garlic ranch dressing. The spaghetti is good, with homemade meatballs and the sauce...well let's just say the sauce is more of a sweet sauce full of taste and not just tomato paste. So our favorite pizza has quickly become the peperoni & sausage. We like to add sweet peppers too. But really you can go wrong. And even the Margarita pizza is outstanding. \n\nWe have dined in & they deliver. Just got to the website & place a web order. Pizza was here in no time. \n\nI love taking out of town friends & family here because it is local owned & operated. A great family place and reasonably priced!",1
Great food. Great atmosphere. Great staff.,1
If you like your sauce sweet - I mean SUGAR sweet then this is the place for you. It does remind me of some Chicago pizzas I had as a kid - Just don't care much for the suagr sauce anymore...to each their own...,0
"We ordered pizza delivery half Chicago and half Italiano, although it tooks in total 1 hour , they told us in advance so we were ready to wait. The delivery girl was friendly. The pizza was delicious, but a little pricey - its expensive when you add $5 delivery charge. Maybe next time we will pick up or go to the restaurant. I recommend it if you want a good pizza",1
Not good.  We wanted to leave our leftovers on the table!  Sauce was way too sweet and crust was way too chewy. Definitely not going back!,0
"Spinatos is awesome. I don't know this place slipped under my radar for so long. It's been here since the 80's. Went here for lunch 2 weeks ago and plan on making it a weekly habit since.\n\nI went with 2 coworkers last time and we split a Chicago pizza, excellent, and less than $7 each with tip... Previous time to that was a spinach topped mini pie that hooked me. \n\nSo hungry now and it's almost lunch time, maybe we should make it a 2 times per week minimum stop.",1
"I HATE when I have a preconceived review of a 5 star rating and I get disappointed. I just wish I tried this one for lunch not a full dinner. \n\nSpinatos disappointed me big time. \n\nThe waitress was a ditz, seemed like she was busy thinking about drinking as soon as she got off work. \n\nThe pizza was OK... they did not ask what crust we preferred and we got the thin. (not my favorite) \n\nThe toppings were very sparse and not that fresh. (we got the 6 toppings on kinda like a \""""everything\"""" \n\nThe sauce was so sweet I thought it was a frozen kid pizza. \n\nThe salad, while large, was brown wilted, bagged lettuce. The tomatoes were dry and colorless. We asked for garlic ranch and she gave us Italian. They do not have Blue Cheese dressing either \n\nThe ravioli was boring, the bread stick was hard and dried out. \n\nShe came by asked what type of gelato the kids wanted, came back 5 min later and had totally forgot she asked asked already. \n\nI was not impressed at all by the entire meal.",0
"I'd heard about Spinato's for some time, but never found myself in the neighborhood to stop in and try it...until yesterday...WOW!! I can't comment on the dining-in service, but I definitely have something to say about the pizza! \n\nSome say it's hard to mess up a pizza, and other say pizza preferences are personal. What I loved about the pizza here was that the sauce was not too salty, not too sweet, and not too tomatoe-y/out of a can tasting. It was perfect! The cheese also quality and aplenty. I haaaaate when places skimp on the cheese. The toppings were great and also not sparse. The pizza didn't have an inch of grease on it and didn't have that soggy middle bottom like some places leave their pizzas. The crust was thin enough so that you didn't feel like you might as well have ordered a bread basket, but not so thin that you felt like you were eating off a cracker. \n\nAs Chicagoans, we had the Chicago pizza...fantastic!!! I can't wait to come back here again and try their other pizzas and calzones. So happy I was introduced to the greatness that is Spinato's!!",1
"Nice place, good taste and good cheese also. At least the specialty is not spicy.",1
"The gluten-free pizza at this place is amazing. In fact, I'd say it's the best gluten-free pizza I've had since I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease seven years ago. Unfortunately, I don't live in Arizona, but I can pretty much guarantee I'll be ordering the spinach special gluten-free pizza every time I come visit family. Bonus points: Redbridge gluten-free beer for only $3 a bottle!",1
Incredible pizza!  Garlic bread was good too!  A little pricey but totally worth it.,1
"I'm glad that I finally found yet another pizzeria that offers gluten-free options for pizza and other items. The gluten-free pizza crust is made by GFC (Gluten Free Creations, one of my fave GF establishments in the city). Tucked in a quiet commercial strip, the place has a very casual vibe and very friendly service. The sauce tends to lean a bit toward the sweet side, but pleasantly so, in my opinion. Nice to know that I have a cool place to reward myself after a hike at nearby Lookout Mountain.",1
Awesome chicago style pizza. Finally a great pizza place in Arizona.,1
"This place smeels incredible when you first walk-in. The major plus was that when you ordered, and received your food, (which by the way was friendly service with a smile and not a lengthy wait) it actually tasted as good as it smelled! \n\nWe will definitely go back for another visit! I love the small, but family friendly environment as well. Everyone seemed to enjoy their jobs there and all of the customers were great, all interacting with perfect strangers. Just a really great vibe! \n\nThe only thing I would mention is that personally I prefer a more savory or herby flavor in my pizza sauce, and their is very sweet. My husband LOVED IT! I liked it too, but it got to be too sweet for my \""""buds\"""" after a few bites. \n\nAWESOME PLACE THOUGH! check it out.",1
Best gluten free pizza ever!!,1
Great place!  Lunch prices are good. Service was fantastic. Pizza is great.,1
"Since moving more centralized, this has become my wife and I's favorite pizza for dine in and to go, as well as the Glendale Ave location.  They offer gluten free crust, willing to do no chese and several sizes of pizza, so your party can get one or two pizza's for all or everyone can get their own preference.  I generally get the small size for myself, which leaves my with 30-40% of the pie for leftovers for breakfast or lunch.  Not bad to get 2 meals for $8-12. The Lil' size is usually enough for 1, if you will not be near a fridge in the near future.  My faves are the Spicy Italian and Canadian on thin crust.  \n\nWe recently took my in-laws here and it was a hit with all! My nephew loved the cheese steak calzone. My mother and father in-law got a thick crust pizza, which was huge and hearty!  They may still be eating it for leftovers. Bro in-law and niece split a plain cheese pizza and said it was aewsome.  The services is always, friendly and the staff makes you feel at home.",1
Visiting from Ca. We found Spinato's. The pizza was delicious the beer was cold and the service was great. A great atomsphere.,1
"I adore Spinato's! I was introduced to them by a coworker and I have been hooked ever since. My personal favorite is the spaghetti calzone. The personal size is more then enough, but I can down the larger sizes like no body's business! \n\nWhat seals the deal with the 5 stars is the service. I have NEVER had a bad experience. The staff is wonderful whether you dine-in or takeout. We were eating there just this weekend and I was amazed at how well they work together. If someone sees your drink empty, they will fill it up, even if it isn't there table or section. On your way out, so many people Thank you and wish you a good evening. The staff is amazing and it really shows!",1
We love the Margherita Pizza! Crispy thin crust. Service is great!   We have been going regularly for past several months and will continue.,1
"After reading all of the rave reviews for Spinato's we decided to give it a try.  We get pizza for Friday dinner often and I was looking for something better and closer to home.  This location is a few blocks off of my normal route, so I put in an online order for two pizzas.  Having had fast food places miss online orders in the past, I gave the shop a call to confirm that the order was received and that it would be ready on-time.  \nWe had other plans for later in the evening so timing was critical.\nAt the scheduled time I arrived at Spinato's expecting to go in, pick-up two pizzas and leave.  \nNo such luck.  One of the 'clerks' in the take-out area started pushing buttons and making odd faces at the register.  Then he called the other clerk over and the both start mashing buttons and making faces at two registers.  Then the short one says, \""""I'm sorry, I don't have an order for you, I can make it up in about 10 minutes?\""""  Knowing that they normally need 40 minutes to get their pizzas ready, I was looking at undercooked pizza or no pizza.  I opted for the second choice and left.  \n\nKFC for dinner.\n\nA half an hour after I was home and finishing the chicken, someone from Spinato's calls and says \""""We have your pizza waiting\"""".  I told the young lady that the call was not appreciated and that I was in the store at the scheduled time and they had no order for me.  \n\nThen to add insult to injury, 3 hours after that, I get a text telling me that my order was confirmed.\n\nNot done . . .\n\nMy daughter really wanted to try the pizza and thought that the mistake was a one- time thing and we should still try the pizza.\n\nOK, we'll get pizza for Saturday.  So I run 20 miles each way to pick-up the same order they had lost at one store and picked it up from another location. \n\nYou can get better pizzas from the grocer's freezer.  \n\nThe crust is flat, no edge, looks like it was runout on a sheeter (machine that rolls out dough). \n\nThe sauce is tasteless, and just that, canned tomato sauce.  \n\nThe meats were also bland, who would expect that from a sausage and pepperoni pizza?\n\nPeople, this is not good pizza. . .  \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n were",0
"Pizza is awesome, period.",1
We came here one night for pizza and had an unpleasant surprise.  The pizza we had was so incredibly salty that after a piece I just couldn't eat anymore.  My mouth felt saturated with salt the entire evening.\n\nThe waitress was very nice.,0
"Found this place by accident when someone brought in some pizza for lunch. Wow just had to go check it out for myself.  Walked into the take out section placed an order and they gave me a free fountain drink while I waited.  Very clean, friendly and attentive to customer service.   And oh yeah the reason I came in is that their pizza rocks!  Had the thin crust pep and Italian sausage. Amazing!  Yummy!  Just found a new fav!!!",1
My first time here was a great experience and I am looking forward to going back to try a plain thin crust pizza. I tried the thin crust with Italian beef and fresh tomato and it was very good. However to me the test of a really great pizza is to have it with just cheese and sauce. I also plan to ask if they will cut it NY style! I just like the triangle slices!!,1
"Have been a big fan of Spinato's since I was first introduced a few years back. I have been to the North Phx, Tempe, and Scottsdale locations and they're all very pleasant.\n\nI would highly recommend their spaghetti calzone to a first-time diner.  I like it with or without the meatballs and ricotta cheese options.  You may be able to split the \""""small\"""" size between two people.  \n\nDecent pricing for a date for two:  \n- They have nightly drink specials (1/2 off bottles of wine, ladie's night, guy's night, etc.)\n- Split the Small House salad & fresh bread to start (or indulge in the mozzarella cheesy garlic bread)\n- Get the Spaghetti Calzone (my favorite item on the menu)\n- Maybe add on a personal size pizza too - the flavor is great!  I go with the thin crust and about any combination of toppings will do the trick.\n\nAlso - take home any leftovers - they re-heat great for a couple days!",1
I'd rather have had DiGiorno!......and I hate DiGiorno.  After reading the reviews I figured there was no way we wouldn't like it and the bad reviews were the usual complainers.  Let be clear in saying I rarely write a bad review but this one warranted one.  We both ordered the personal pan pizza and it was barely enough for my appetite but I didn't want to spend over 10 dollars on a pizza for myself.  The sauce was horrible!  It was sweet and my taste buds were confused.  The server admitted that its a particular taste and the taste was not for her lol.  Go figure that the employees don't even like the pizza.  I never had a pizza with a sauce that was that sweet.  It was very strange.  The people who rated this 5 stars must have no taste in food.....sorry.  My fiance at one tiny slice and walked out hungry.  I finished mine and thought to myself..what the heck am I eating.  The one thing I can say is that they comped her meal at least.  We didn't ask but they did.,0
"Good pizza - if you like sickening sweet sauce.\n\nYelpers, you seriously are high to give this joint anything over 2 stars.  Family friendly and family owned gets one star, maybe another star for homemade sausage, but that's about it.  $23 later and I feel like I had a Tombstone pizza with Prego sauce.  The garlic was foodservice pre-minced crap?  How difficult is it to chop some garlic?  \n\nDo yourself a favor - avoid and have a real pie.  No need risking Type II Diabetes from dinner.",0
"We've been raving fans of Spinato's for a few years but what happened on Valentine's day, 2014, moved our affinity for this company to a new level. My daughter is serving in the U.S. Air Force, currently stationed in Guam. It's 6,444 miles from Phoenix to Andersen Air Force Base on a tiny island the size of Scottsdale in the middle of the vast Pacific Ocean. She's so far away. There's a giant hole in our hearts from missing her. She knows we love Spinato's pizza, the sauce with it's sweet and savory goodness, the family friendly service and the affordable prices in a time of vast economic uncertainty. It's a little slice of comfort. So, she wanted to surprise us with a gift card to our favorite restaurant but that's a little hard to do from so far away. Spinato's stepped up in a big way. Not only did they sell her a gift card, but they sent one of their managers, with a bouquet of twelve red-heart balloons, to deliver her gift to our doorstep. Spinato's act of service for one of our military members went above and beyond the call of making great pizza. They showed their patriotic spirit by helping an airman reach out with a comfort-food hug to her parents. Thank you Spinato's! Your actions reflect selfless service to others and bring great credit on your company, the United States armed forces and pizza makers all over the world!",1
The pizza is delicious!!!! I had half Hawaiian half spicy Italian on thin crust & it was so good!! The cheese to sauce to toppings to bread ratio was perfect. It's going to be my new go to pizza place. Can't wait to try other items on the menu.,1
"I really don't understand the raves for this place. We tried their pizza once in the past and it was totally forgettable, but we were so swayed by all the 5 star reviews we thought we'd try it again. We ordered the medium 14\"""" Mamma Spinato's Signature Fresh Spinach. Menu price is $18 but with the $4 (!) delivery charge, tax and tip this medium pizza cost us almost $30.  We were told delivery would be 40-45 minutes but the pizza took almost 70 minutes to arrive. (Ordered at 5:20 pm on a thursday.) The pizza was barely lukewarm on arrival but we were so starved we each had a slice while the rest went into the oven to re-heat. The pizza isn't terrible, it just isn't great and certainly not worth the price. The sauce and spinach mixture on the Signature is sooooo very sweet and there is nothing else on this pie to break up that sweetness. It barely satisfied our craving for actual pizza.  Also, for some reason this round pizza is cut into squares, so you end up with edge pieces that have a nice crisp crust on them and then you have this whole section of soggy middle pieces with no crust at all. We ended up eating around the outside and I guess the middle will go into the trash.  All in all we are putting this on the \""""never again\"""" list. We can get a delicious pizza from Aiello's that is nearly twice the size for the same cost and it will usually arrive on time.  I will say the person who answered the phone and the guy who delivered the pizza were both very nice.",0
"As far as customer service, they receive an A+. Wonderful staff. \n\nAlthough, the food is not my cup of tea. I ordered a side caesar to begin and a pepperoni calzone. The caesar dressing was very fishy. The pizza sauce was way too sweet.",0
"One of our family's favorite places! Consistently great service, recent functional expansion to get carry-out orders out of the way of dine-in guests. Bartender (i think Vicki) is fantastic, kiltlifter on tap, Wednesdays 1/2 priced wine bottles, good portions on salads, great pizza options and attentive staff. Despite the various locations in the phoenix valley, we could really use one further west =)",1
"The service here was good. Unfortunately, the food here, like other Spinato's locations I've been to over the years, was bland, bland, bland. In the area, the location was convenient for the time that we had to give. On this trip we tried a Sicilian pepperoni pizza (excessively oily) and a MaMa's signature calzone (wet and runny, not moist). While there are worse places to eat, there are certainly better.",0
Pizza is good! sauce is sweet. They have lots of options.,1
I absolutely LOVE Spinato's!  I highly recommend the Baked Spaghetti Calzone -- It's fantastic! They have the best marinara sauce I've ever tasted. Their staff is always upbeat & positive. And they deliver -- Woo Hoo!,1
"In search of The Valley's Best Calzone, my friends and I headed first to Spinato's. The bar is high for our \""""Best\"""" being Ciro's in Mission Beach, CA. If I could give a !/2 star, I would give Spinato's a 4.5. My friends tried their calzones with pepperoni, and opted for the ricotta. I tried theirs and it was very good. The pepperoni was not quite as spicy or excellent as Ciro's, but still good. I opted for a meatball and jalepeno calzone with the ricotta. We all ordered an extra side of marinara as the calzones were not as \""""saucy\"""" as we hoped. But all in all, very good! Great crust: not too overwhelming, the sauce was on the sweeter side but the jalepenos offset that sweetness on my varietal. Overall really tasty. We will go back to try the pizza but still in search of a Ciro's competitor. .... As my Grampa would say, \""""Mangia, mangia\""""!",1
"First visit, and just eating at bar on my own.  Wanted a speciality pizza but no ham.  The bartender said that isn't allowed without \""""creating your own\"""" pizza option, which would cost more.  I asked to talk to a manager.  A couple of minutes later, I suggested to the manager it doesn't make sense to have to pay more for just holding one item (I wasn't trying to substitute anything).  He agreed but said it is company policy set by the owner and that he is not allowed to override the policy.  This is bad policy.  I ended up ordering the pizza, had to dig out the ham, and then it got thrown away.  Such a waste.  The pizza was tasty. I would suggest to the owner to have some flexibility on common sense policy.  The manager suggested the possible reason for the policy is the kitchen chef is too busy to deal with these requests.  I would suggest that it only takes a split second to see the order \""""no ham\"""" and would not slow the process down.  Not to mention then food would not be wasted.  I feel sorry for the employees who have to enforce and explain this excessive policy, as both the bartender and manager said they agreed with my logic.  The one star rating is solely for the company policy.",0
"It was our 5th Anniversary and we were all set to go to Grimaldis in Peoria.  We got there and found out that there was an hour and a half wait.  Forget that!  I talked my wife into coming down here to Spinatos.  I had gotten a pizza from here a week or so ago and it was pretty delicious.  We drove down here and decided to eat here.  We walked in and were seated outside on the patio right away.  We went with a Greek Salad and a medium pizza with pepperoni and garlic.  Pepsi products to drink.  Here is how the food tasted...................\n\nGreek Salad-  We got the \""""entree\"""" sized salad and it was plenty for the two of us.  This thing was packed with lettuce, feta, tons of split olives, pepperocinis, onions etc.  We each had about 2 plate fulls worth.  Their dressing is delicious.  Creamy but not layered on heavy.  It was a great salad.\n\nPepperoni and Garlic Pizza-  My last pizza from here was for pickup.  It was a bit soggy when I got it.  When you eat in, it turned out to be much better.  Still a tiny bit greasy, but still delicious.  Our pizza was cooked proper with a little brown on the cheese.  Their sauce is fantastic and the pepperoni and garlic was a great combo.  Their sauce is a tad sweet but not too much so.  A medium pizza is perfect for two people.  Its a great Chicago thin crust.  I definitely want to try out some of their other offerings. \n\nThe reason I am giving this 5 stars though is because of the service!  The hostess was great, our waitress was on point and when we were leaving, everyone wished us a great evening and thanked us for our business.  Speaking of that..........while we were waiting for our check, an older gentleman came walking around asking tables how everything was.  It turns out that it was the OG himself...Ken Spinato!   The guy who started this place back in the 70s.  We chatted for awhile and got into a good conversation about our move from San Diego and how we were going to go to Grimaldis but came here instead.  He was impressed that we had driven from Surprise to come here.  We had a great conversation about pizza, their sauce, Phoenix in general etc.  It was a great way to end the night.  I'll be honest...Grimaldis is still my favorite pizza in the Phoenix area, but Spinatos is definitely creeping up the ladder.  Definitely the best Chicago style thin crust I have ever had, plus the service and overall friendliness of ALL the employees I have encountered will keep me and the family coming back!  I can definitely see why they are a Phoenix institution and why people love them so much.  It was a great 5th anniversary and I'm glad we spent it eating dinner here at Spinatos!",1
"Simply whoa. This place is my new Italian restaurant. Everything tastes top notch and worth every penny! The pizza was one of the greatest ive ever had. And I LOVE pizza. My wife got the pasta, which I would never buy eating out, but it was really delicious. Definitely a go back for very soon.",1
My favorite sauce of Pizza in the Valley. It's a little pricey but definitely a great Pizzza.,1
"Saturday Dec. 6,2014, \nMy wife and I enjoyed your thick crust pizza.  As usual the pizza was outstanding, the service great.  All said it was a perfect dining experience.  We have been enjoying your pizza for many years, Our server was Suzanne, thanks to her and your staff.",1

"I stopped here strictly by accident a few weeks ago. \n\nWe have a Carl's Jr near our house and we go there occasionally. This one was advertising that they were also a Green Burrito. So I thought, why not?\n\nFirst, the employees here a friendly and very helpful. They clearly like their jobs and working at Carl's Jr. The food on the other hand, as the review indicates is only Two Stars. And, yes \""""Meh, I've experience better.\""""\n\nMy expectations were only in the Taco Bell range and sadly I wasn't disappointed. It was pretty basic. About two years ago, around Super Bowl time Carl's Jr introduced Chicken Strips. They were Four Stars outstanding. Now, they're barely Three Stars. \n\nWhat's changed is the size and freshness of the chicken strips themselves. I'm sure Tyson, or whoever was the vendor was told to reduce their size. They did and now I'll pass on them in the future. Its too bad, because they were better than the Colonel or Popeye's!",0
": (\nHubby was craving Carl's burger and we were in this neighborhood, so we ended up here...\nA few odd things...\nHubby had the Western burger and I had the bacon guacamole $6 dll burger... Staff was friendly, food was OK. Mine had a strong flavor, like cumin (I guess I do not like cumin very much) but I didn't know if it came from the guacamole or something else.\n\nMy sweet potato fries (large) were like half. While the container was flat on the tray it looked full, but once I picked it up... I swear, it was almost half...\nHubby had the criss cross ones and that was reasonably full, but the odd thing is that he asked for large but the receipt said medium.\nStraws? They only had short straws by the fountain drinks, which barely stick out of the large cups, like a cm or less... I went and asked if they had long straws and they immediately gave me a couple from behind the counter... o.O\n\nLike some other yelper mentioned, the tables, seats and floor look like greasy... \n\nAaaaand, to top it off, my hubby noticed a bug behind me... and it looked to me like a tiny roach (like 2mm).... : ( those brown ones with a yellow spot...\n\nYuck... please remind me not to stop here ever again... : (",0

"This is a large church, so if you're looking to come in and not be noticed you'll be fine.  The music is loud, but fairly well mixed.  I personally think the vocals are hard to pick out.  It's more moddern type worship and suites the younger crowd very well.  Older individuals may not feel very comfortable during the music, but the sermons are excellent, challenging, and will speak to all types of people.  If you're in the area, give it a try.",1

The few \""""services\"""" I have been to have always followed the same basic style:  SINGING, More Singing, a very long sermon, more singing, a collection, a baptism or two, more singing, and an altar call.

Took the kids here for bible school they were fed rotten food had to beg for water treated my kids like CRAP left them in the hot sun for 30 min it was summer are yall serious? because we weren't apart of the church.

"I love Phoenix First! From the first service I attended I felt welcomed. I attended for about a month before I got involved. If you plug in to a group or begin helping, you will feel better connected in such a large church. My kids love it too! I have 4 that got involved in the Wednesday night programs. They are such a blessing. For a while, I sat in the same section and got to know some people that way. Once I was comfortable, I moved around a bit and met others. I became a Missionette sponsor many years ago. Met some really great volunteers and parents that way too. If you want a home church with many ministry outreaches, this is the place for you. They have over 200 ministries!\n\nNow, about the negative comments, AG is biblically based. Pastor Barnett preaches straight from the Bible. He is not a wealthy preacher with a mansion and lots of cars and a plane. He is not a 'name it and claim it' preacher. He does not preach to tickle your ears and make you feel good. I began Phx 1st when Pastor Tommy was preaching and Pastor Luke was just starting out in LA. I remember Pastor Leo and is purple suit (may he rest in peace). All of the pastors are fantastic.\n\nI do not know of anytime a child would be denied water in the summer in Phx. Please. She wrote her review in Nov.\n\nPersonally, I read the reviews. Positive and negative unless there are too many. I want to know something or someone before I go or do.\nIf you have made it through my whole review, thank you. Bottom line, you will love the move of the spirit at Phx 1st and you will love the church too. God bless!",1
This business is recommended by Discount Tire locations.  Good pricing and fast service.  They did such a good job on my alignment I was wondering if I had the right vehicle.,1
Stand up guys. Scott took care of me and didn't pressure me into any repairs. He was kind enough to quote the needed repairs and offered to just do the bare minimum (safely of course) to get me back on the road.  I'll be referring friends to this shop so long as they are in business.,1
"Took my Jeep in for the post-lift alignment. Turned out the alignment was spot on (props to Cutting Edge 4x4 who installed it) and they didn't charge me. I overheard the tech talking to another customer explaining, with a sample part, why they needed to replace a worn tie rod end before they would do an alignment. So again, no charge for unnecessary work and a very helpful explanation. The honesty is refreshing and I wouldn't hesitate to go back even though its a far drive for me.",1
"I was a Saturday walk in, concerned my brakes might be a bit wacky after some shimmy on a recent backroad trip.  Scott worked me in in less than two hours.  He found nothing wrong, said I still had 45% of the pads left, adjusted the brakes,  added fluid, thanked me, shook my hand, and gave me my keys.  No charge.  With this kind of service and honesty, I'll be back.  In addition to the simple honesty, this is a *local* shop and I like keeping $ local when possible.\n\n(Should have gone to the Dairy Queen next door - not really local, I know.  Rolberto's,  about 100 m north, earns 3 stars as the friendly staff adds an extra star to 2-star food.)",1
"Took my car to Discount Tire to get new tires.  After the installation, the tech told me about my wheel lock stud being broken on the rear left side, so he gave me a piece paper with Network Alignment & Brakes name and phone number on it telling me to call them and they'll fix the wheel lock for free.\n\nI called yesterday afternoon asking how long will it take to fix the issue, the guy on the phone said with appointment, about 45 minutes.  So I set-up the appointment for this morning and I arrived few minutes early, and I was greeted right away.  The whole process took less than 20 minutes.  What an awesome job they did.",1
"These guys rock for sure! I had a 3inch lift installed on my FJ cruiser with aftermarket upper control arms. When the other shop completed the lift I had serious alignment issues. I brought my Fj to Network on Cave Creek and these guys had me aligned and out in no time. These guys know what they are doing for sure.\n\nSide note: Prior to bringing my truck here I tried Toyota dealer for alignment and they were gonna charge me through the roof, they looked at me like I was from outer space. They proceeded to tell me I would need additional parts to get this alignment done. Well Network didnt need extra parts and it drives smooth. Thanks guys!",1
Having a hubby that knows cars I am not usually tricked when I go to get work done on it even though they try so hard. The guys at Network Alignment were not like this. Really honest people. Assessed my current alignment and told me it's not horrible but not factory specs. I knew it was causing my tires to wear faster so I went ahead with the alignment. I will faithfully take my car here because of their honesty and fair prices.,1
"I went in thinking this was a 60.00 job for my Audi but after Edgar looked it over he said, \""""It's straight and in perfect order, No charge!\"""".

"Disclaimer: I had a terrible experience with a stylist here, but will make an attempt to keep my venom from poisoning the rest of the review. It has been about two months since my visit, and  I can now look in the mirror without seething so I thought it was time to put it on record. Here goes...\n\nThe Digs: Salon Boulevard is in a convenient spot for Phoenicians in the Moon Valley area, located in the LA Fitness complex right next to Half Moon Bar & Grill. The interior itself is on the smallish side and what you might typically expect from a strip-mall salon.\n\nThe Walk-in: Feeling a bit lackluster after a bout of Pilates, I decided a trim was just the thing to put some bounce back into my locks - lo and behold! There was Boulevard Salon and their\"""" Walk-ins Welcome\"""" sign. Serendipity.\n\nThe front desk person was very busy, but friendly, and said she could get me in with a stylist in 15 minutes whose price would be $35 for a trim. Sweet! She asked if she could bring me some coffee and invited me to have a seat. After about 10 minutes and no cafe au lait, I simply got up and served myself. Not a moment later, Ms. X fetched me for my cut.\n\nShe took my cup, set it at her station, and immediately led me to the sinks and began shampooing without even looking at my hair while it was dry or asking what I wanted. Back at her station, I told her I just wanted a trim and my side-swept bangs maintained, to which she replied \""""Yes, yes, something plain. I see you are a plain girl.\"""" Um...ok, lady.\n\nTo make a long story short, Ms. X spilled my coffee on me, dabbed ferociously at my crotch, yammered ceaselessly without ever waiting for a response, then gave me a whole new hairstyle of her choosing that was some sort of long bob with butchered bangs that ended up too uneven to do anything with but pin back. And the icing? She wanted $5 more to blow dry. \n\nSince I left \""""wet\"""" I didn't realize the extent of the devastation until I returned home to dry and style. I'm ashamed to say I even thanked her for the mutilation of my head. And tipped. *sigh*. \n\nThe other clientele seemed smiley and unaccosted. At the time of my visit, it was mostly older ladies getting their curls set under the dryers, though I believe they are a full-service salon and offer several waxing and nail treatments as well.\n\nThe Resolution: In the end, I did call Ms. X back that day on her cell and left a message explaining that I would not be returning to the salon and why. I regret not speaking to a manager to give the business a chance to make amends. As it is, I do not plan to return. I even park as far away from the place as possible when going to the gym. And I'm still waiting for one side of my bangs to grow back long enough to get them fixed.",0
My mom and I got a manicure and pedicure here.\n\nMy mom enjoyed her experience with Shannen.\n\nI did not enjoy my experience with Janien. To start she shaved the little hairs on my feet with a razor that was not in the disinfecting liquid and then replaced the cap and did not put it in disinfecting liquid. Do you realize how many disease you can spread like that? Then she didn't put my flip flops on before putting on my polish and wanted me to walk barefoot from the pedicure station to the other side of the salon to the manicure station. Luckily I was saved from this disgusting venture by another stylist who offered me some salon flip flops to put on. Which hey why didn't you put those on before hand??\n\nThey use aceton nail polish remover and don't have non-acetone which was annoying but not really her fault. Finally my biggest annoyance was that she layered - globbed really- the nail polish on. So even thirty minutes later (waiting for my mom to finish) my nail polish was still wet. And at no point was I placed under a light or fan or anything for them to dry. So I get home and three nails have little marks and dings and one nail is ruined. That's HORRIBLY annoying when I just paid 60 bucks for both. \n\nPS Cash only,0
"I have been going to Salon Boulevard for several years now. I have seen a stylist, a nail tech, and the aesthetician (facials and waxing) and I absolutely love the laid back, relaxed atmosphere!

Anyhow, after the cut here in surprise, I was referred to a stylist at Salon Boulevard by my friend.  I honestly cannot thank my friend and my new stylist Eve enough.  I thought I would have to get all my hair chopped off to fix the bad cut.  Eve saved me about 5 inches of hair.",1
"So I need a haircut.  And in a Costco in southeast Phoenix, where I live, I see this gentleman about my age (senior) sporting a really good do.  I ask him who does his hair, and he gives me the same of Sandy Clark at Salon Boulevard.  I call Sandy and make an appointment for 3:15 on Wednesday June 4. \n\nToday (Wednesday June 4) I roll out, leaving plenty of time for the 20-mile-odd trip, but Sandy's directions are so bad that I spend almost 20 extra minutes trying to find the Salon. \n\nAt 3:15, the moment I realize I'm going to be late, I call the number Sandy gave me; the same one I used for the appointment.  It's her cell phone, and it goes to voicemail.  I leave a message explaining I will be a few minutes late. \n\nAt 3:30 I call again.  I get voicemail again. I  leave a second message explaining that I am cruising the parking lot unsuccessfully, but nonetheless on my way, when I spot the Salon.  It's minuscule, and tucked away in a dark corner with tiny signs to identify it. At 3:35 I am inside. \n\nSandy, however, has left.  Deciding within 10 minutes that I would be a no show, and not bothering to check her phone, she trotted off to do something far more important than attend to a paying customer with a reservation: you know, someone who might easily have become a repeat customer who brings his own friends in.   \n\nInstead, she gets this sucky review on Yelp!, plus warnings to all my personal friends, colleagues and business associates to stay away from her and from Salon Boulevard.  Oh, and on Facebook too.  What her hairdressing skills are like I can not personally vouch for ... but if she loses focus this easily, I guess I'm glad I never had the opportunity to find out. \n\nThe lady behind the counter tried to offer me another appointment with Sandy Clark on some future day, but given the above -- plus I don't see the point in another 40-plus-mile, possibly pointless round trip -- I won't be showing up there again. Ever.\n\nAnd in my opinion, neither should you.  \n\n(Tabitha, where are you? Salon Boulevard needs you!)",0
"I have been to this Quick Trip several times over the past 8 years. It's easy to get in and out of and normally there is always a few spots open to pump my gas. It's also conveniently located. I can stop here on my way to work and still be on time. I don't usually go inside, but the inside is nice (for a gas station!) and easy to navigate. Overall, I really like this Quick Trip and would rather to go any Quick Trip than a different gas station around the valley.",1

"Umm this place is awesome. I got a bike basket for 25 cents. 25 cents! Too often these days I run into \""""thrift\"""" stores that miss the thrifty part, but not this one! It's fun to shop and you may end up finding a truly good deal!",1
"Well, I hate to do this. Been coming here for YEARS!!! Prices have been wonderful, shopping was fun. You could get a full on outfit for under 10 bucks, you could get decor for super cheap. Went in today after months of not being there. The store was empty, parking lot not full and when I saw the prices of items I could see why! Whoever is the new manager there increased prices so much it's ridiculous! Items that would be a dollar or two at Goodwill is prices at $8-$10 (I'm sure this will hurt the organization they are trying to support, bummer!)\n\nI don't know if I'll be back......unless they get someone in there to price items accordingly.",0
The staff at this location has ZERO sense of urgency. It drives me crazy! Be prepared to wait in a long line and cross your fingers they get your order right when you've waited 10 minutes to get a coffee. \n\nI would offer this advice for such a popular location... Have someone taking orders of customers waiting in line! Every morning you have a line that expands all the way to the front door. This location would be ideal if management spent some time with their staff on time management.\n\nWake up Starbucks! Let's get going!!,0
All Starbucks are not created equal. This location is good. Staff very friendly and helpful and the coffee was good!,1
Never been to a worse Starbucks.  \nWent to the drive thru and Kim was rude and unfriendly. She was more concerned with continuing the conversation with her coworker. No sense of urgency unlike the other locations I've been to.,0
"So, I'm driving from SEA to PHX with my 65-year grandmother who manages to invite herself into my 06' Saab 9-3 for my 1500 mile journey to my new home. I should've known better than to let her drive! She was hauling ass, really enjoying herself, blurting out such things as \""""I feel so young again!\"""" and \""""I love going fast!\"""" Although, she made me nervous, I also enjoyed seeing her happy, so I allowed it to persist until she hits a HUGE pot hole going 70mph in a 50mph. \n\nBam! $800 Anti-lock Brake System repair.\n\nWhen I took the Saab into get it fixed the service was fantastic. They were very helpful. They even had this old man drive me back to work. He was a creepy old man. It was so funny. \""""The best part about college are the cute horny girls.\"""" Ummm. Ok. Old man. TMI. \n\nAnyway, so they diagnosed the car, \""""fixed it,\"""" cleaned my car inside out, and delivered it to me! Great, right?! Wrong. The car was returned with the engine light on and the gentleman who delivered the car said nothing. So I begin to drive and the car doesn't accelerate. Its driving like an effing golf cart. Pretty comical, but I wasn't happy. I call the service dept, they agreed to scan the car for free if I brought it back in, but were not convinced there was anything wrong. So I took the car in and it appears they didn't finish the repair! Once they scanned the car's computer they immediately knew where to look. The guy pops the hood, and boom various pipes are not clamped down and the air sensors are not attached. Lund Saab, really?\n\nThey were clearly embarrassed and I forgive them for not knowing how to apologize. They did give me a new gas tank cap after it came up on the scanner because mine had been recalled, which I guess I'm supposed to be feel happy about except for the fact they should have fixed it with the initial repairs! In the end, I'm not happy with their lack of detail, which is why you pay top dollar, right?",0
"Turning 30 did NOT mean I wanted a hybrid, another 4-door sedan or something my mom would drive.  don't get me wrong, i love my mom. I just am not ready to turn into her.\n\nSo, it was time to get the convertible I have been talking about buying for YEARS.  After an online search through countless dealer sites, I came across my Saab convertible on the website for Lund Cadillac Hummer & Saab.  The high-def photos on their web site had me thinking I was looking at photos from a car show.  I called that same day to inquire about the one I wanted.\n\nThe internet sales manager, Frank Barela is great! He brought the car to me the next day (on my lunch hour!) for a test drive and made sure that all my questions we answered and needs met.  There was no hassle in the buying process and Frank made certain I was comfortable with my decision. \n\nOf course, the car had major selling points but the attentiveness and service level made my decision easy.  I am confident that my decision to buy from Lund (...and Frank) was the right one.  Every time I get a compliment on my car, I mention Lund and my experience. Thank you, Frank Barela! I love my Saab!",1

Recently purchased a 1996 Corvette on the private market.  After some research on the internet decided Arrowhead Cadillac had the best reputation for Corvette service in the valley. Brought it in to have it completely checked out and all problems addressed.  I couldn't be more pleased with the work done and the experience as a whole.  Todd kept me informed as work progressed and answered all my questions.  I definitely will bring it back for future service and recommend this dealership to others for it's professionalism and courtesy.,1

"Was in the process of finalizing a deal on a used 2007 GMC Denali, when I took the vehicle to my mechanic because of a slight bump in what felt was a transmission issue it turned out to be that the motor mounts needed to be replaced. I called the GMC dealer and was quoted $1200.00 for repair. When I approached my sales manager at Arrowhead Cadillac he said he would do it at their shop cost of $1500.00. He made it VERY clear that he was not going to fix the vehicle for \""""free\"""" as he put it. I guess what I don't understand is why would a dealership that sells $30k-$80k vehicles feel the need to place this vehicle on the line knowing of it's condition? I would think that if they were not going to fix the problem they would just wholesale the vehicle to another low end dealership. That said, the manager told me that this is why we sell used cars and this is why we offer warranty contracts. I pretty much lost my faith in this dealership. Moving forward I will now only purchase \""""certified\"""" used cars.",0
"Purchased a 2013 SRX with 17,000 miles in May, 2014 for a car that \""""just came in.\""""  Looked good and seemed to run well.   Sales experience was mostly positive, although I was never informed that this was a rental car nor that a CARFAX report was available.  Anyhow, problems began within two weeks:  a severe oil leak that soaked my garage floor;  three weeks later, a dead battery that left my wife and I stranded for an hour in blistering heat;  next, just last week, rough idle and near stalling which required the replacement of the cam solenoid.  The car is a lemon.  I have asked for an exchange or replacement.  A phone call to my salesman, an e-mail and follow up hard copy to Ken Walsh, the Sales Manager have resulted in NO RESPONSE.  Don't like being ignored and having to write this YELP review.  Buyer beware!  This is not a trustworthy dealership!  Buy elsewhere.",0
"\""""It's a manufacturer problem, not a dealership problem.\""""  That's what I was told by\nGeneral Sales Manager, Ken Welsh during a phone conversation after posting my one star rating of the dealership on YELP earlier this month.  Mr. Welsh told me that there is really nothing he can do about the defective and poorly performing 2013 SRX which I bought from Arrowhead Cadillac in May, adding that my wife and I should just \""""enjoy the car.\""""   Quite condescending, wouldn't you say?  Would you want to buy an automobile plagued with problems from a dealership, only to be told that  that \""""It is a manufacturer problem, not a dealership problem?   I think not.  THINK TWICE BEFORE BUYING A VEHICLE FROM ARROWHEAD CADILLAC.   2 THUMBS DOWN.",0
"Frustrating experience.  We have purchased two vehicles in the past six months from Arrowhead Cadillac.  The first one was a brand new SRX.  Part of the purchase we had a spare tire included.  It took over seven months to get.  But the real problem was with the purchase of a used vehicle.  The salesman when we were looking at it (Frank) was making small talk with us.  We had our two sons with us and told Frank we were purchasing a computer for our oldest son for college, as he had just graduated from high school.  Frank suggested he upload porn on it.... We also had one service issue after another, but the service department did fix things - even when we discovered part of the frame was missing from the vehicle.  But the final straw was when we purchased an extended warranty from Jorge Martinez on 8/4/14.  When I called the warranty company at the beginning of October to make sure the warranty was in effect, I was informed the warranty was \""""invalid\"""".  They said they would not warranty a 2005 vehicle.  When we called the dealership, they said they had no idea and that they were never informed from the warranty company that it was invalid.  They said they tried to push the warranty through, since we had already purchased it but they had no luck.  So they said we would have a refund of $2,115.00 coming to us in the next 2-3 days.  It has now been two weeks and no refund.  We have left several emails and phone messages to Jorge Martinez but he has not returned any of them.  We have also left messages for his boss, the finance director, and have not received a return call from him either.  So far, we are still waiting on our $2,115.00 refund and are frustrated at the poor customer service and lack of communication.  Beware of this dealership.  If I were in the market to buy a new Cadillac or used vehicle, I would definitely recommend car shopping and service elsewhere.  In fact, my used vehicle has needed service recently, but we have taken it all the way to Chandler to receive honest work and great customer service.  Moving away from this dealership was the best decision I ever made.  I hope others don't make the same mistake.",0
"Took my '95 ETS to Lund Cadillac to have the AC recharged this January.

Decided on a new fitness program and included in that were a list of supplements I needed to get.  I walked in here and wasn't greeted until I was practically at the counter staring the guy down and even once he finally acknowledged me I felt like I had to drag him around to try to find the things I was looking for.  I would ask where one item was and once he showed me he'd start walking away and I would have to ask him to wait because I needed other things to.  After a couple rounds of that I decided to just find everything myself.  I don't know if he pre-judged me and thought I wasn't going to buy anything because I look young or because I was in gym clothes but either way it was wrong.  The best part was once I had about 3 different things loaded up in my arms he realizes that I was actually going to spend money and maybe he should be more helpful.  THEN he started helping me compare things and explaining different deals they had going on.  At that point I pretty much had everything I needed/wanted so I was ready to go.  At the counter he did give me a $10 off coupon for next month which helped a little bit but I was still irritated with the lack of service I'd been shown originally.,0

"I was looking for help locating an apartment when I found an online form on the Apartment Finder's website. The guy that contacted me wasn't able to contact me at a time that works for me and wouldn't discuss it over e-mail, so I gave up.\n\nI'm disabled and was looking for help with an apartment, but I am not awake in the mornings because my disabilities keep me awake at night. Mornings seemed to be the only time he could call, and I kept getting voicemails from the morning when I was not available to take the call.\n\nI ended up finding apartments on my own.

"We're in a huge bind right now. I haven't been able to find full time employment, my mom lost her job, and my brother doesn't make a lot. Due to our situation, we're limited finding apartments because of income. We have to move this weekend due to really high rent at our apartment and our apartment manager recommended apartment finders. I submitted the form online and Kevin called us back. I have never spoken to someone so rude in my life. We were looking for an apartment on a bus line convenient for my brother and I to get to work. I work in South Phoenix, and he acted as though I don't know what the commute is like. I am well aware. We didn't want to live south and felt we could do better in the northern part. I got a lecture about the apartments we searched and I looked into them because of the prices that were listed on their website. You'd think apartments would list correct prices to avoid wasting time talking to people, but I am now aware that they mislead people. The worst point during this phone call was when Kevin assumed I'm stupid. I have a lisp, but that's it. I don't have some mental impairment. In fact, I have a bachelors degree I earned with a 4.0 GPA, my graduate school GPA is a 4.0, and I have membership into two international honor societies. Telling me that you're going to speak \""""really slow\"""" is just uncalled for especially when your question was just to ask where I work. \n\nIn the end, Apartment Finders wouldn't work with us because we don't have a car and don't know anyone who would take time to help us with transportation.  I don't think I need to be treated horribly over the fact that things are really tough on us and we turned to a business that is supposed to help you. I don't need to be treated poorly because I finally found a job and just haven't received a paycheck because I started two weeks ago. I know that I'm going to tell people to steer clear of Apartment Finders because of the way my mom and I were treated over the phone.",0

OMG! Avoid this place at all cost!,0
Horrible customer service.. I pulled into the parking lot at 7:55 when they close at 8pm. The man inside ran over and locked the door right in front of me when all I needed was an oil filter for my bike and would have taken 5 mins or less. I know they lost at least one customer as ill be going back to north valley Honda and I hope many more do as well after reading this review.,0
Give this place a chance to earn your trust and your business.  Great staff and always giving me options to choose from with features that are the most important to me.  And their return/exchange policy is second to none.,1

I can walk to cycle gear from my house and drove out of my way and spent good $$$ at a place way more deserving than cycle gear.

The vet told me my skinny dog was over weight! I told them that their scale was off but they said it wasn't.  I went to Pets Mart later that night and weighed both of my dogs.  And I was right, their scales are off.  I even brought a 10 lb weight to make sure Pets Mart's scale was right.  So my entire annual visit was based around wrong information.  And I feel they talked to you like you were an idiot.  They also overcharge for teeth cleaning.  I would NOT recommend this vet.",0

The neighbors are horrible and the apartments are tiny.",0

I had to find another apartment, then when I ask for my deposit back they want to keep it!!  The people in the office are very rude (except Carmen, she was very nice).  Don't waste your time on these apartments.  Btw for anyone else who wants to file a BBB complaint, there main company is called NCM Mangagement",0
"Beware of these apartment complex they are the worst of the worst. I lived there for a year a whole year I can't even believe I actually survived and I mean that literally. The only way I survived was practically because I mainly just came home to sleep. So where do we begin? Mmmm... Starting of by appearance the apartments look run down old and there is cockroaches and bed bugs I was constantly having to put heavy chemicals just to keep those nasty bugs away. One day when it rained our 2 bedroom ceiling started leaking I had to put buckets to catch the water and on top of that Managment took 3 weeks to come and actually look at the damaged caused by the rain. Next is couple situations that happend here, I lived on the third floor (the last floor) the very first one at ground level lived a older man that I never got to meet but, basically after complaining for over 2 weeks about little red bugs what looked like fruit flys taking over our apartment, we come to find out this older person was dead for over 3 weeks it was crazy!! Police and what looked like CSI in white zipped up suits were all over that apartment it was scary. Another thing about these apartments are constantly scared for my life situations all from people fighting, shootings, drunk fights, 2 episodes with child protective services taking kids away, home robberies, car theft, possible prostitution (I say possible because there was men coming in and out of this girls apartment but, I didn't actually witness the prostitution happening but seriously what else could it be), and drug dealers! Oh almost forgot one of the apartment caught on fire!! I really can go on and on about these apartments. Don't let the cheap rent convince you! My husband and I were going through a really rough time financially and that's how we ended up here, but I will never ever go back and I for sure DON'T recommend living here you couldn't even pay me!! Staff is very rude and don't care about your safety. If I could I would rate a negative 0 lol! I wish I could tell you everything in detail about this horrible awful place but, it will take too long.

He told my dad that he had over paid the tip and allowed him to run the tab again.  We thoght this was very honroable.",1
"Manuel's has always been a safe, solid choice for Mexican food. It has always done the job. I haven't been in for a couple years so when I went last night, I was pleased that not much has changed.\n\nWe started out with the Texas margaritas. They are HUGE. Delicious and worth every cent. But POTENT. I have a high alcohol tolerance, especially when it comes to tequila, but my husband couldn't even finish his because he has a low tolerance for tequila and he was the DD. So I finished his. :)\n\nSalsa and chips were good. Salsa was very fresh tasting. I wish the chips were hotter and crispier. They tasted like the generic chips you buy at the store.\n\nMy husband ordered the 3 amigos enchilada plate. He said it was really good. I tasted the spinach enchilada that came with the plate, and I concur that it was really tasty.\n\nI had the chili relleno plate which I'm still scratching my head over. I must have had over a million chili rellenos in my life but never one like this. The chili wasn't dipped in a batter, it was just wrapped in egg. I was disappointed by this dish. I know the that the batter for chili rellenos contains mostly egg, but it's not pure egg. It has a little flour, milk, and sometimes baking powder to make it fluffy. The sauce that covered it wasn't very saucy. It was green chilis and onion basically. The whole thing wasn't terrible, just disappointing. Beans and rice were still delish though.\n\nI am still rounding up to 4 stars because everything else I have had at Manuels has been great. Cheese enchiladas, their gigantic cheese crisps... all delicious and satisfying. And their service is always excellent. I will just avoid the chili relleno from now on.",1

"Well, I have learned a basic rule about Mexican restaurants, if it's crowded its good (Or it's happy hour). I got nervous right off the bat, I chose this place the parking lot was almost empty and it was about 12:30 or right in the middle of what should be the lunch rush. We were seated right away in a nearly empty restaurant. From there I can say good chips though they say award winning chips and salsa, but the salsa tasted like El Paso out of the jar. The rest of the meal was outstanding. I had the Green Chili con Carne burrito enchilada style lunch special with green chili sauce on top. It was an amazing taste sensation. The beef was not shredded but more like tender stew meat seasoned to perfection and the beans and rice were pretty good too. My wife had the shredded beef taco lunch combo, She said it was good but about average for her. She really liked the chips but was not impressed with the salsa either.  I liked the novelty of the shirts they sell there, but in my circles I couldn't think of a time it would be right to wear it they say \""""Excuse me, It's the frijoles\""""",1
"We have been going to this Manuel's for 27 years.  They have the best salsa and chips, and green corn tamales I have tasted anywhere.  The staff has always been efficient and friendly.

"The first review I read of this place said it was the \""""only place to eat real thai food\"""" and after stopping in, I've very tempted to agree.\n\nMy friends and I were craving Thai after leaving the Yelp holiday party the other night.  So as this was the only place for such on the way back, we stop in.  While it's not much to look at on the outside, this tiny family-run restaurant just feels welcoming once you enter.  Well lit with sizable booths (the 4 of us didn't feel cramped) and a very friendly server/host/possibly-owner.\n\nWe all proceeded to order our various dishes.  Even though the place was a bit chilly, none of us went beyond the generic \""""hot\"""" level of spice.  And when my Larb came out, I'm glad I didn't.  Yow!  I might love spicy food, but I'm gonna have to train before I can get to Thai Hot levels.\n\nOf note, the pad Thai really seems quite good.  My brother ordered it and of all the dishes at the table I tried, that impressed me the most.  It's so easy to make pad thai bland and boring, but this had a nice gentle sweetness to it.\n\nNot that I know exactly what \""""real\"""" Thai food is, but I'll be coming back here regularly to get as close to it as I can.",1
"I was starving and needed a Thai fix STAT-- found Krua Thai online and oh boy! Literally a block from my house. First time I totally missed it, it's hiding in a dark strip mall catty-corner to Taste of India. \n\nI did a circle, tried again, bingo! I parked right in front of Krua and what a sight to behold.. A warm glow, charming [possibly silk] orchids and a faux fountain trickling behind the glass door. No one was dining on a Monday night, but I was about to.\n\nBehind the podium in the back perked up an elderly couple, super-friendly and ready to meet the challenge of serving me some mind-blowing Pad Thai. \n\nDid I say I was starving? Shrimp Panang, Tofu Pad Thai, Veggie Rolls, and Pineapple Fried Rice. I requested take-out, and called my husband while the order was whipped up. It was a reasonably-priced meal that made my Mini Cooper smell so delectable I almost needed to pull over a half-block from home to dig in.. but that would be rude to my friend at home who was going to [attempt to] share..\n\nThe Panang was spicy but cool with coconut milk, the Pad Thai was light but loaded with the good stuff, the veggie rolls were crisp and heavenly, the Fried Rice a sweet contrast. The best thing about it all? This was the least-greasy Thai food I've ever had! \n\nA 5-star will be doled out after experiencing the dining in Krua.",1
"Man, I am going to miss Krua when I move back to Washington. I was pretty convinced the Southwest just didn't understand Thai food the way the West coast did, but I've been proven wrong. I'm updating my review because I finally got the chance to eat inside. I love the decor! It's just a small hidden place but it really is worth eating inside.\n\nI started with a water and a sweet Thai iced tea. I've never had anything like it! Super sweet and served with heavy cream on top. When stirred, the whole drink turns a bright orange. It was a really nice contrast to what we ordered..\n\nPineapple fried rice. Shrimp panang curry. Tofu pad thai. Veggie spring rolls. Get ready to say the Lord's name in vain, because that's all I can really do when I eat food from here. It's just great. I love the pad thai especially because it isn't overly greasy or soupy at all. The tofu was really good, pan-fried to perfection. And I like it hot! Even at a mere 'medium' spice it was burning my palate. The veggie rolls were meatless and were made with lots of pepper counteracted by the sweet and sour sauce. Steaming hot, extra-crisp. Great big portions make for plenty of leftovers for tomorrow's lunch.\n\nThe service is quick and the man who always seems to be working is so so friendly. We got pretty cold from a breeze coming in, and he even closed the door. \n\nI don't care what you Thai purists have to say... I get around when it comes to pad thai and this place is duking it out in my heart for first.",1
"I have tried on multiple occasions, various owners, and both locations that Krua Thai Cuisnine have occupied, and still find they miss the mark when it comes to consistency, flavor, and authentic flavors. As is often with ethnic foods in America that are aimed at those who may have never left our borders, the flavors have one thing in common, sweetness. Sugar seems to be the common glue that tricks the unsophisticated palate into thinking a food is great. Krua Thai conforms to this method of preparing dishes. Consistency in preparation is also missing. True, many a chef will modify a recipe taking advantage of seasonal fresh veggies or substitute when a particular ingredient may be hard to find such as Thai Basil or Kaffir Lime but to not follow the very recipe as it has been printed in their menu, missing common items, not just once, but again and again, this does not bode well for repeat visits. \n\nIf you do in fact find yourself still curious, the dishes marked spicy are only indicators that they can be made spicy, do not forget to ask for them to make your dish with chili otherwise your salty sweet dish will not have a hint of heat.",0
"WOW! The name said it all. Krua Thai means Thai Kitchen and the food is definately authentic THAI(Hmm...So good)! As always I ordered Kra Proa Kai. I had the pleasure of meeting the owner and her husband, AMAZING people. One of the BEST Thai restaurant in the Valley!",1
"Finally tried this place.......reviews are 100% spot on.\n\nSome of the freshest, best-tasting Thai we've experienced anywhere......the Tom Kha soup - to die for!!    \n\nCurry - fantastic...........loved the Chili Fried Rice - delicious!\n\nLove that it's BYOB as well...........small strip-mall location........can't be beat.\n\nIf you think you like (love) Thai - you owe it to yourself to try this place out.",1
I tried this place on a whim after searching for takeout using my phone. I was pleasantly surprised and will definitely make another visit. The Spicy Cashew and Deep Fried Tofu with Vegetables was really good and so was the Pad Thai. I'm looking forward to trying some of the other dishes. The inside was casual and clean.,1
"I've been coming here for nearly ten years and over the years as much as once a week and not much has changed except for them moving a couple doors down to be in a larger space.  The quality has been consistenly very good, from the food to the service.  The place is owned and run by a thai family and the food is as close to Thailand as I'll ever get.  I've tried other thai places in AZ and in a couple of states and none can compare to Krua thai.  As a regular to this place, I recommend giving it a try.  I don't think you will be disappointed.",1
"I don't tend to look for Thai food in Phoenix, and I'm no Thai aficionado, but Krua really delivered. My wife and I tried it tonight after looking at Yelp reviews. We got the Panang Curry with chicken (ordered thai hot) and... Pad Prik King with beef (ordered very hot) Both were excellent, and when they say hot, they mean hot. My wife and I can both stand pretty hot/spicy food, and the \""""thai hot\"""" level was really nice, and accumulated over time.\n\nThe Panang (yellow) curry was excellent and we both decided it would have been better had we not ordered it so hot but we had to try the hottest none the less. The Pad Prik King (red curry) was a nice complement to the hot yellow, and slightly sweet.\n\nIt's a very small restaurant and service was very nice. It might not be the most authentic Thai on the planet, but it was quite respectable and very well priced.",1
"This review comes at least six months after two visits; one in which I was disappointed and the second, with which I was seriously pissed.\n   I can't reasonably dispute the positive reviews since I can't imagine anyone bothering to promote a place they don't actually like and yet, and not for the first time, my experiences here were worlds away from you more fortunate Yelpers. Yes, the service was fast and friendly but at a price I'm no longer willing to pay.\n   Visit 1:   I picked the budget friendly option of a lunch special to go of beef w/ red curry. At home, sipping a bit of the curry, I was treated to a complimentary burst of flavors that were very palate friendly. I thought I'd gotten lucky (only food-wise, can we talk?) and would be able to chalk up a new go-to Thai place, but as I spooned the dish over the rice and forked my way through the meal I became increasingly aware of a mounting saltiness that became relentless in the end. I know that people share a varied tolerance for salt; some just a little and some can't get enough. I can happily crunch through a half bag of salt and vinegar chips so I'm not exactly a salt sissy. But obviously too much of it in an otherwise tasty concoction just makes it a mess not worth serving. That's my vote on this one.\n   Plus, the egg roll was ridiculous. I didn't expect it crisp after the ride home but neither did I imagine the indestructable toughness I bit into. After a major effort to get the first bite down I realized that the dough wrap was at least twice the thickness of any roll I've EVER had and that I found so little filling of any kind that I had to check it out. Surgery STAT revealed contents of precisely two (2) bean sprouts and one (1) slender shred of cabbage. Period. That's it. In the trash. That was my budget lunch. Disappointing, but not bad enough to write them off just yet.\n   Visit 2:   Thought I'd take a chance and order what I really wanted instead of another 'test' meal.\n   In trying to recreate a truly great experience in the past from a place no longer around, I ordered Pineapple Curry With  Roasted Duck And Tomato from their list of 'Specialties' Sound good? Well, the curry WAS good; not too salty this time.\n   But back home, I soon realized that my parachute had failed to open: picture no more than a dozen slivers of duck, each the size of two toothpics side by side and 3/4 as long. Maybe a quarter OUNCE of meat? Maybe not even..\n   Envision similar sized bits of slimy skin floating around independently, indicating a minimum of four days in the pot, as did the rest of the ingredients.\nNon-ripe tomatoes. In July. In Arizona.\n   Add to this the fact that the kitchen (conspicuously) added what amounted to literally FIVE times the canned pineapple (why ever bother with fresh when you're just using it as a filler anyway?) that a dish this size can realistically support.\n   So that was my 4 minute, 'from order to door', 'Specialty' from Krua for 'only' $15.25 inc. tax.\nI'm absolutely certain they wouldn't have dared serving this 'bottom of the pot' debacle to a sit-down customer without  expecting to see it turned into 'instant wall art' but gambled that a  $15 take away probably wouldn't come back to call them out on this.\n   I'm doing that here. No Mercy; and never again.",0
"We really enjoy Krua Thai.  Its a small place and never super crowded.  The food has been reliably delicious.  My husband prefers Krua Thai to Sala Thai, but I'd maybe say it's a tie with overall experience being better at Krua and food maybe slightly better at Sala.",1
"My mom and I love this place. The owners are so sweet and the food is divine. My Mom always orders the yellow curry dish every time we go there. I adore their thai basil dish with chicken. We frequent this place so much that the owners and chefs know my mom.\n\nFirst of all, their lunch specials are awesome. There are many options, and they come with a cup of soup and a spring roll. Their soup of the day is always different and so, so delicious. I have gone in here just for the soup before! The dinner sizes are also available throughout the entire day, and the portions are pretty large. I would recommend the lunch specials though, its enough food and the soup and spring rolls are so yummy!!",1
"OMG, not only did I fall in love with my boyfriend because of this food but we also moved to be closer!   \nNow let me explain...I love Asian food and I also LOVE spicy food, but I had never been here...my boyfriend and I had only been dating a short while and I thought I had him figured out until he brought me here for lunch and not only introduced me to the most amazing food I have ever tasted but also introduced me to the owner and \""""Head Chef\"""".  \nI don't know if it was the spices creating endorphins or the realization that my man is an incredibly intellectual and cultured foodie that made me actually fall in love with him that day but we have gone back weekly ever since.  \nWe decided to move in together and I'm not going to say that the proximity was our only deciding factor but it WAS on the pros's list for sure!  \nWe love the Num Tuk (#14), the spicy rice, and the yellow curry.  You get so much food that we usually agree to only order 2 things each time but it is always a struggle to decide which two items to order because we can't even decide what our favorite is AND we also want to try something new each time...so our order is ever changing but we have NEVER been disappointed.  \nBest Thia food I have ever experienced and in reality my favorite restaurant in town!\nDon't miss the coconut ice cream.",1
"Delicious. I went for lunch today and got the red curry with tofu, which came with soup and a small eggroll. They used fresh tofu, not deep fried, which was a new twist for me. It was delicious, fresh tofu cut with ridges so as to absorb more flavor from the curry sauce. I ordered it \""""hot\"""" and that was plenty spicy for lunch! It made me sweat, and I have a fairly high tolerance. In any case, the place was nice, the food superb and service was friendly. I'll be back!",1
"What an awesome place. A hole in the wall in a strip mall on 16th street and Bell Road. Very clean place with prompt and courteous service. Had the Chicken Satay ($7.95) with Peanut Sauce as an appetizer. Grilled perfect. The Tom Yum (Hot and Sour) soup had such a fresh taste from the lemon grass and lime. As it cooled, the flavors melded and transformed, also getting a little spicier with each bite. A small bowl fed two people ($4.50.) Next up, entrees. We shared a Krua Thai Rama, which is Stir-fried chicken in spicy peanut sauce served over a bed of lettuce. This was $8.95. The flavor was incredible but there was just a bit too much sauce. Mixing rice in with it helped. The last thing we tried was out of this world amazing. Chicken and Shrimp Pad Thai. We got everything with \""""Medium\"""" spice which was perfect. We eat a lot of spicy food and medium was just a a great temp. The Pad Thai also was $8.95. We ended up bringing home half of each entree for lunch. This will definitely end up on our list of places to take friends for dinner. On our way out we glanced in the kitchen and it appears they also make their own noodles!",1
"I have had the yellow and green chicken curry and both were delicious. I have had both dishes to go and they give a generous portion. The service is polite and fast and food is delicious.they are closed on sundays, thats the only bad thing i can say about this place so far. Will definitely go back for more and try their dishes.",1
Been here a few times. Close to the house. Not bad for this part of town. Nice pleasant atmosphere inside. Service is good. You can peek through the serving window and see them making the food. I had the Tom Yum soup extra Thai spicy and it cleared up my stuffed up head within minutes. Great flavors. Simply Yummy!,1
"Not sure what all the other reviewers are talking about unfortunately. Went here starving one day looking forward to an amazing Thai dinner bailed on all the previous reviews. I was excited and in the mood for Thai. Ordered the crispy tofu, tom kha with shrimp, pad tai and red curry with pork.... The whole meal was essentially uneatable. All I could taste in the soup and curry was cream something sweet and lotsa salt. The steamed rice was good but that's about it. When I peaked in the kitchen I saw an older Asian lady so I thought it was gonna taste good however I was severely dissapointed.  I don't know if I just got the wrong stuff or  the ol lady was having an off day or what. But suffice to say we hit five guys on the way home I was so sad.",0
"Well, seems the reviews are up and down so may be I got lucky but, I will definitely be back! Food was hot and tasty! My only knock would be a little more protien in the meals would be nice however, the flavors & spices were just right!\n\nTom Kha was good, not my personal favorite but good.\nNum Took was awesome!!\nPad Thai was great - ordered med and it was pretty hot! just wish for a little more chix & shrimp.\n\nVery good overall - I will be back!",1
"First visit was not that impressive.  Service was great, place was nearly full but the flavor profiles were way off with limp texture.  \n\nThe Tom Yam Goong soup was extremely sweet, not so sour and lacking spice but had a generous portion of shrimp and mushrooms.  The pineapple curry was made with canned pineapple that was excessively sweet and limp.  The Pad Kee Mao had vegetables that were limp from overcooking. We had water for drinks so these three items totalled the bill to $39.00, tip additional.  \n\nEvery restaurant has feature dishes, we must have chosen some of the wrong items.",0
"This place is right down the street from me, so it's definitely convenient. I think their food is delicious! I've had the Pad Thai several times, the garlic chicken, and the green chili chicken. I was not disappointed by any of them. I highly recommend it. The staff is always polite and the service is great.",1
ok so.. I'm obviously no thai connoisseur.. but I was really looking forward to a good peanut sauce with my Pad Thai.. Fail.,0
"My first time here, last night.  My sister and I split a noodle soup with chicken.  And for our entree, we ordered Panang with tofu and vegetables.  Everything was delicious.  We went to order extra rice, because the first bowl didn't turn out to be enough, and the 2nd bowl, with an extra charge of $1.75, was much larger than the first.  \n\nThey apparently do a very good \""""take-out\"""" business, as people kept coming in to either pick-up, or place their order, and wait.\n\nI will definitely come back.  The restaurant is attractive, and very comfortable.",1
Just horrible.  Tea was rancid and curry was sour rather than sweet-hot.  Waiter pushed back when I sent the bad food away.  I recommend bypassing this place.  I will never go back.,0
"This is the best Thai food I've found in Phoenix, and I've been to Thailand several times. Spice level \""""hOt\"""" is just right. My nose is running :-) Green curry has great crunchy veggies, Thai tea is nice and lunch specials are under $10.",1
"I'm a big fan of Thai food. I ordered the Veggie Red Curry, medium heat. But they accidentally mixed up my order with another customers. I took one bite and thought my head would explode. He ordered extra extra spicy. That experience was awful, but the staff corrected my order and multiple people apologized when they saw the tears running down my face from the heat. Honest mistake, although I may have burned off a few taste buds in the process. The owner even stopped by to apologize. They corrected my order and it was delicious. The Thai ice tea was also larger than I'm used too which was awesome! I would definitely go back. It's tucked away in a strip mall, but don't be fooled by that, it is quite delicious.",1
"Krua Thai serves good thai food if you happen to live north of Phoenix.  We ordered lunch portions of Stir Fry  Green Chilli, Sweet Basil (with Tofu), Spicy Fried, and Garlic Chicken and all dishes turned out well made and were well presented. Service was efficient, quick and lunch portions are priced very reasonably.  \n\nOne word of advice though: When you order your entree \""""hot\"""", it is made very spicy(hot). You will certainly start sweating. Mild and medium levels of hotness should sit well with most people. \n\nWill definitely come back and try their dinner menu.",1
Great Thai food and great ambiance for a hole in the wall joint. The food has been consistent and much better than other Thai joints in the valley. The only drawback is that they do not serve fountain drinks so you pay a lot of money for one small can of soda. Stick to lunch specials if you plan to visit this joint since dinner is more expensive and literally serves up the same food minus the soup and egg roll.,1
"I love this place. A mom 'n pop place serving very good Thai food at good prices. Watch out for the heat level and be sure to let them know if you want your food mild. And by the way, a bit of warning: If you order the \""""garlic lovers,\"""" you had better be a BIG fan of garlic - in it's almost raw form. The garlic taste is truly intense, which is the way I like it, but I know that most people would probably find it a bit extreme.",1
"Great Thai food here. Small place with limited seating but there is usually always an open table. They are heavy on the spice so beware. If you order Thai hot be prepared to sweat. Portion sizes are large enough to share between two \""""non-starving\"""" people. It's small and a little tucked away but definitely worth finding.",1
"I found this place to be pretty mediocre. Four of us got take out from here and we had the pad se iew, pad thai, and stir-fried sweet basil. We also got sides of the steamed sticky rice. All were good, but nothing that I'd probably go back for, or really recommend as a good representation of \""""great\"""" Thai food. All four of us could have used more heat on ours, and while we could have ordered the next level of heat, I'm not used to having to go all the way up and order the spiciest level at the first go - especially with Thai food which is known for its heat! I'm usually a mild person, but I'd definitely go medium, maybe even spicy/hot from here to get a little more flavor. My veggies were nice and crisp and my noodles not too soggy. Could have used a little more egg in the pad se iew, and much more flavor all around. As as the 3 stars suggests, it was A-OK. Not bad by any means, but would have loved more flavor.",0
This small establishment has become my favorite Thai place in north Phoenix. Food is always wonderful and quick. Service is good as well. Prices are very reasonable. Larb is my favorite appetizer and the curries are quite delicious. I would recommend ordering medium level of spice. The Thai Ice Tea with cream is yummy too.,1

I can be very selective on Thai food. This place was amazing. The Pad Thai I ha was outstanding!,1
"Vegetarian Dishes are AWESOME!\n\nTom Kha Soup with vegetables and Pad Thai (no egg) with vegetables are the best in Phoenix.\n\nI could live off of those two items!\n\n....just ate there today and already feel like having more.\n\nSticky Rice for dessert is very tasty, too!",1
"Breathtaking, amazing, and beautiful are just some of the words to describe this place. There fried wontons are amazing with an Amazing sauce. I always have there yellow curry, and it is amazing. Prices are good and nice serving size for great leftovers. Potatoes could be a little thinner cut but still amazing. The yellow curry is very spicy but still worth it! You HAVE to come to this place! Extremely authentic with very nice service and a good interior (not great).",1
"Oh my, where do I start? let me say it this way. We tried this place because we thought service was going down in our regular Thai place... well, I will be happy to take the old place slowness anytime, compared to how rude the people at this place were to us.\n\nI honestly am not sure if they know we are paying customers, it was a combination of people with bad manners doing you a favor, and being reprimanded at school.\n\nThe food was good, but not awesome to put up with this. And the worst part is that our party was 5 and they included the gratuity in our check. I think people are entitled to have a bad day but I really could not believe it. I would never tip a penny, but if I ever did, this was the time.\n\nThe coconut soup is good, I think that is the only item I had. So, about 3.5 stars for the food, 1 for the service. \n\nNow, if you are not sensitive as I am, give it a try : P",0
"Krua is our go to for Thai when we're not looking to drive (Siam is the best in Phoenix but a bit of a hike).  The food is always good and price is reasonable - we normally get the pad thai and a curry, alternating between yellow and pineapple curry with duck.  For the pad Thai, don't expect anything fancy - they serve up a more basic version than other americanized fare.  And watch out when spicing it up here - medium is on par with Thai spicy at other joints.  Go ahead and play it safe, they've got a shaker of spice at every table in case you need to up it a notch.  Don't forget to order a Thai iced tea to wash everything down.",1
We just loved it... a lot food... spicy upon request.. good service. . Ill go there again for sure.. loved there iced thai coffee..,1
Nice people. Cute little place. But the food isn't that great. The meat was undercooked both times I tried beef and chicken. The only two good things are the veggie rolls and the vegetable soup. The vegetable soup is really tasty and has a lot of flavor in it. I don't recommend it unless it was for either of those.,0
"Love this little, genuine place! It has great lunches and has ruined me for pad Thai anywhere else in the valley! Their soups are a must!",1
"I think overall this place is more of a 3.5 stars. The Pad See Ew was not that great. Needs more sauce, the noodles were a bit dry. The green curry was delicious. The papaya salad was good, but I don't know that I'd get it again. The medium hot was a bit too spicy for me because I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy. I'd say the medium hot is a bit spicier than Serracha.",1
"I love Thai food and this place was amazing!  Great food (I had the Yellow Curry and the girlfriend had the Pad Thai)  Both were great!  The GF likes everything super HOT and it was!  Be careful!  We also had the coconut milk soup and it was to die for.  It's a small place, but the service was great.  Don't expect 5 star atmosphere, but all in all very good and excellent prices.  You won't be disappointed.",1
"The food was extremely bland, and actually the worst Thai I've had here in Arizona.  Won ton weren't impressive.  The noodle soup tasted as if if consisted almost solely of (canned/boxed) chicken broth with no added spice or flavor.   Attempts to doctor it just made it too salty, so I am pretty sure it was an everyday high-sodium canned chicken broth, and not a boiled chicken stock.  Service was okay.  Parking is fine.  I won't be back.",0
"This is a little, local owned store that pales in comparison to other local owned stores.  Having had reptiles, fish and birds my whole life, I would never buy anything from the wild, and this place has a reputation for having cheap prices because of the low quality of their animals.  I have found wild caught animals in this store repeatedly.  I have also seen animals very improperly housed, along with feces in the cages.\nI have also had a conversation with the owner who was dropping some very racist bombs into the conversation about our current president and anyone who speaks multiple languages.  \nIt seems that all of the knowledge they have is only gained from elementary readings and minimal experience.  Their fish selection looks as though it was an old Walmart setup, which means if one fish is sick, they are all sick.\nIt is hard to tell people not to support a family owned business, but with a racist husband and a lady that never moves from her stool behind the counter but has an attitude on her, and with experiences as described above, it gets somewhat easier to tell you to go to another store.  It is worth it to drive to another pet store that does not support taking animals from the wild, does not hire weirdo's, and has a less \""""racist\"""" staff.  I know of another reptile store at Bell and Cavecreek that has a much, much better selection.",0
"I've used Valley Interiors several times over the last four years for a number of projects with very good results.  Recently they made some custom cushions for a  unique elkhorn chair - very successful and at a very fair price-- and recovered dining chairs for my neighbor with excellent results.  Overall, I've been very satisfied and have really enjoyed working with their management and associates.",1
"Before you have granite work done by them, PLEASE ask to see our pictures. Terrible, extremely noticeable and customer service unprofessional.  rerr3@cox.net",0
Don't waste your money this was the worst Chinese I've ever had.  Absolutely bland flavorless food I think they keep there costs down be removing all the ingredients from there dishes.,0
"I'm new to the area and didn't know what my delivery options were. Based on the reviews, this place sounded like a home run. I was so disappointed! The food is reasonably priced, they deliver for $12 min, and delivery was quick, so it warrants 2 stars. I also love the fried noodles they included with my soup. Unfortunately, everything about my General Tso's combo was subpar. The meat was all dark meat, and some of it quite fatty. The fried shrimp that came with it tastes old, as did the rice (and who messes up fried rice?).  In the unlikely event that I order from them again, I will steer clear of the chicken!",0
"Thank God! After many trial and errors trying to find a decent Chinese restaurant that delivers, North China Restaurant fills the bill. The sesame beef, General Tso's and house lo mein are really good. Pass on the fried rice and shrimp with lobster sauce though. Those dishes aren't bad, but definitely not their best.",1
"Please don't waste your time or money!  Absolutely horrible, it taste as bad as the building looks! HORRIBLE SERVICE TOO!",0
"One of the few places that delivers to my area. Average food, good sized portions, fast delivery. They do, however, scrimp on the vegetables in a combo meat/veggie dish, although I guess that's better than scrimping on the meat lol. \n\nLemon chicken: LOTS of chicken, decent lemon sauce\nShrimp fried rice: 4 big shrimp, mostly rice and a few veggies\n\n\nWill try again if I'm in the need for delivery.",0
"my son and I just ordered delivery from this place because we got a pamphlet and the door, we ordered the sweet and sour chicken and the kung pao extra spicy!!! fantastic the only reason not a five star not enough sauce on the sweet and sour next time going to ask for an extra side!",1
"Lady on phone was rude and would not take there coupon, food was not good, way too much breading on shrimp and general chicken was hard as a rock. \nI would have to pass not impressed at all, kids wouldn't eat it either.",0
Alls I can say is can you find a decent Chinese place in this town I appreciate they can't speak English over the phone so I'm sure it's authentic but these people really don't know how to cook so unimpressed with the food I'm voting Panda Express over this garbage food Alls it was good for was dog food cause it wasn't edible,0
"A couple of weeks ago I found a menu for New North China on my door. First off, how long can a place be open and still be new? Anyway, I wasn't in the mood for pizza and didn't want to go out. I ordered some General Tso's Chicken, a dinner special, and a small order of house lo mein. The total was $17 and some change. I thought this was high, and was informed they have a $2 delivery charge.\n\nWhen the food arrived, I was excited for some delicious Chinese food. It wasn't delicious whatsoever. As a matter of fact, it wasn't even good. I am VERY disappointed in this. It feels like a waste of money, and I am sitting here on a Saturday night hungry. I won't be ordering from New North China again. I would recommend you look elsewhere.",0
"I have been there twice- 2 times too many. I had acrylic nails put on and they looked hideous. Prices are decent for a reason. The people were friendly, but the actual service was horrible. The nails were crooked and I had to go home and fix them myself. I actually thought to myself how stupid can these people be--- it's your job. Either way.. don't go there.",0
"Never returning to this place again! I was really disappointed with the way the staff treats the customers. They told me one price when I went in and a totally different price when it was time to pay. Moreover, the staff tends to talk in their own language, which I find very disrespectful.",0
If you are looking for DON AND THERESA they opened their own shop. It's on cave creek and bell rd. It is called Tiffany nails by Don & Theresa.,1
"I really like this salon. They are reasonably priced, and the Spa Pedicure deal (it's on the wall) is a great package at a great price. It's very clean, too. My favorite techs are Lisa and Ann. \n\nBy the way, bring cash for the tip, otherwise you'll have to run next door to Fry's. They don't allow you to add tips to your total bill if you use a credit card. Merchant service fees can get expensive for merchants and they are probably just trying to keep their costs down.",1
"Came here on a recommendation from my Mom's coworker. I made a reservation for two pedicures at 2:30 on a Friday. My Mom waited a half hour before anyone came over to start her pedicure. As for myself, it is almost 3:40 and I still have not had anyone start my pedicure. Oh wait someone did remove my old polish and then she walked away. So I am still sitting here. Oh did I mention two women came in after me and are almost done with their pedicures. Yes they came in well after I was here and are almost done. Hmm that doesn't seem right. I am almost inclined to get up and walk away. Then the owner came over to finish my pedicure. Ugh. This is the worst customer service I have experienced at a nail salon. Not only that but the worst pedicure experience. I left with not even having my feet massaged. My suggestion, don't come here ever. Worst experience ever.",0
"I was recommended by a good friend to come here. She had never gotten a manicure, but she loved the pedicures there. I love nail art, and wanted something cute I had seen on pinterest. I had my phone on, showing the picture I wanted the gel manicure of the entire time. The lady didn't know what she was doing!! I had to tell her how to do her job! I have no idea how she got her license. She didn't know how to glue/put a stud on my nails--I had to \""""give her a suggestion\"""" because it wouldn't stick. She didn't file the nails enough because  when I left I felt them edgy, jagged,  and pointy;and not just one of them--but four of them! GREAT! \n\nEach time I am going somewhere new, I ask them how much their gel manicure is, and she told me 25.00 for a gel manicure, and 25.00 for the pedicure that I wanted. Once I was going to pay they said it is 65.00 for both! I was so pissed! They said it was extra for the \""""art\"""" they had to do. I was like: \""""Art? Are you kidding me? What \""""art?\"""" I told them they should have mentioned that to me before! I am one to ALWAYS leave a good tip, and this time I did not feel bad for not leaving a tip. Honestly, I could've done a much better job with these nails. \n\nThey are so unprofessional here, and the customer service SUCKS! I WILL NEVER COME BACK HERE AGAIN, OR RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE! That's what I get for trying out a new place. I will stick to my wonderful Whimsical Nails on Thunderbird and Tatum!\n\nIt's been four days, and two of my studs already fell off!!! I am so mad because I knew this was going to happen as I showed the \""""nail technician\"""" that she was doing it wrong, and suggested to do it a different way!

"This may be the worst nail salon on the planet.  The first time I went in for a gel manicure they said it was $25 but failed to mention they charge an extra $10 to remove the gel from a previous manicure.  The second time I went in for a gel manicure and to get my eyebrows waxed.  The woman burnt the top of my face..... NO JOKE! She also had her dirty hands all over my face.  I have been getting my eyebrows waxed for over 10 years and never once has anyone needed to fondle my entire face to get my eyebrows waxed.  Then, when I was getting my gel manicure done the girl kept messing it up blaming it on the LED light being broken.  Less than 24 hours later my nails were ruined. (Usual gel manicure lasts 2+weeks)  I would never spend money here again.  This place has terrible service.",0
"If they had a 0 star rating I would give them a 0.\n\nI asked for square tips they gave me a few natural,  square, and rounded tips.\n\nThey tried to charge me 35.00 when their board says 25.00. Then I started complaining about the service they all ganged up on me telling if I don't like it for me not to go back next time, one of them also told me to leave with half service completed. I will never return there.",0
Line moving slow. 15 mins to start ordering. Got order in and stood there while 4 people behind me in line were told to check out ahead of me while I waited for one of the 5 people working the line to cut chicken. Then was told an 8 minute wait for egg rolls. I passed at least a dozen restaurants to get here. Next time I'll go to one of those.,0
"This is the second time in a row that I have stopped in first time about a month ago approx 2pm this time 830pm. Both visits exceptional! Store is clean (table, chairs, counters) food is ready and good. Service was great with samples offered. It appears \""""Ping\"""" is in charge and runs a tight ship. I appreciate it, it shows at all levels she cares. Been a long time since I let half my meal get cold to write a review, but they are doing a good job at this location. Thanks Panda at 9th n Bell rd.",1
Never coming back here again! Got charged 167 dollars for a meal that was 16 dollars. Had to call the bank since my account got overdrawn and didn't even get an apology. I used to come here all the time but they definitely lost my business for good.,0
Getting charged for ranch when it comes with your meal is ridiculous. Who orders chicken strip dry? Also the people there are rude.,0
"This place is a ripoff. I had a storage unit for 2 years here. When I deceided to give it up they would not prorate my fees when I was told by the staff and manager that they prorate fees. They had no concern for my situation, the staff is very unfriendly. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.",0
"So many hours clocked in here I can't begin to imagine the number. When I followed a low carb diet I ate lunch here mon-fri almost everyday for a year and a half. When I say the chicken is consistently good I speak from experience.\n\nMost of the staff has remained the same over the years. I've never had a bad experience service wise. All of this equates to a decent sized following of locals. You can expect to see many of the same faces in there for lunch and happy hour.\n\nThey have very good happy hour food and booze specials.\n\nChicken, tri tip, white fish, shrimp, lobster tacos, fajitas.. its all good. I haven't had anything here I wasn't happy with, excluding maybe the quesadilla.\n\nAll the meats are mesquite charbroiled and very tasty. The parking lot smells amazing all the time.\n\nThe chicken is very heavy on the black pepper and garlic. Their marinade/rub is put all over the chicken and under the skin as well at times.\n\nThey have a nice salsa bar with at least 4 different types of salsa plus spicy pickled jalapenos and carrots. Their chips never seem to be overly greasy and are surprisingly fresh for sitting at the salsa bar under a heat lamp.\n\nI'm also a fan of the wings. They are nonstandard as far as the wing sauce goes but they are a nice change from the standard franks/butter.\n\nWhen it comes down to it its solid food at a reasonable price. You can't ask for much more for a regular day lunch experience.",1
"I'm shocked at myself that I ate here, but it was a last resort due to me needing to take Adam to the airport.  I've been to Chuys in Tucson for dinner, which is always have had a good experience with it being that it is a total hole in the wall.  But did anyone know that they had breakfast?!  Well they do.  So we went in and weren't expecting the world knowing what the place was.  We sat ourselves because there was no staff in sight and just 2 older people at the bar, at 8am lol.  So we sat for a few minutes and then a girl came to us.  She got our drinks and then we told her we were ready to order and she said that they don't do table service and she would meet us at the register.  My mind was boggled because there were only 2 other customers in there who were done eating.  How could she not think that she should just take our order with ALL the time she had instead of making us walk ALL the way across the restaurant to place an order for a whole 2 burritos.  So I give her zero stars!  I give the burritos 3 stars because they weren't the best I've ever had but they were good enough and they didn't give me a tummy ache!  So I give a total of 2 stars because of the servers one star.\n\nChuys is always going to be a good choice for mesquite when you need a quick bite!",0
"This was the most horrible for I've had in YEARS! I'm pretty forgiving but I can't forgive the junk they cooked here. Please don't go, you will be horribly dissatisfied...I went at 12:30pm on a Friday.",0
"Many years ago I had some not so good experiences with Firestone shops and have avoided them since.  Luckily for me one of my tires decided to all but blow up (tread flapping loudly but amazingly air still in the tire), very near this shop.  \n\nI drove the half block from where I'd pulled over to check the damage, noisily slap slap slapping the whole way, my friend telling me there was no way I was going to make it before the tire went totally flat.  The tire held, as I knew it would, and we pulled into the Firestone. \n\nOnce inside I had to wait only a few minutes before Chad, the very pleasant store manager, came over to see what I needed.  At that time all I wanted was to have the spare put on and the mangled tire zipped up in the spare tire purse.  (What are those things called?) \n\nTo my surprise he had a technician pull my car in and take care of it right away.  We were only there for about 15 minutes, it would have been much less time had the poor guy not had so much trouble getting the tread flapping tire all zipped up.  To my even greater surprise when I went to pay, Chad said, \""""No charge\"""".  Okay, starting to kinda like this place.  Nice customer service.\n\nWhen I got home and begin pricing tires I was again surprised to find that Firestone was only a little bit more for comparable tires than the other big Discount tire place nearby.  I decided to spend the extra $8 at the Firestone because of the great customer service I received.  Oh maybe that was their plan all along..go figure.\n\nI went back in armed with my internet prices and knew exactly what tires I wanted and how much it should cost.  Justin, the brand new shop manager, (He literally just got to Phoenix the day before, welcome to Phoenix Justin) greeted me when I came in even though he was helping another customer.  \n\nWhen he was free he looked up the tires I wanted and informed me they needed to be ordered but he could have them in less than an hour.  I couldn't wait due to an appointment I had later in Chandler.  I had Justin order the tires so they would be there the next day.  \n\nI asked Justin if they were the same as the on line price, he verified that they were and I said I'd hoped they'd be even less.  He promised to see if he could do anything about that when I came in the next day.\n\nThe next afternoon I dropped off my car and waited at Manuels Mexican restaurant a block away (Great Mexican food and Ritas).  It took a bit longer than expected but I didn't really care.  \n\nWhen I got back to pick up my car Justin went a step beyond his word and somehow managed to get me a great deal on the tires, including the road hazard.  He also had my car fully checked out and told me that I didn't need anything else, my car was in good shape.  \n\nNo up selling, no trying to get me to buy an air filter or another service I didn't need.  He had told me that it was his policy to never sell a customer something they do not need and then proved it by giving my car a clean bill of health.  \n\nSo, if you are in the North Valley and need work done on your car, think there might be something wrong, or you need new tires go see Chad and Justin.  They are amazing and run a great shop!  \n\nI was going to give them only 4 stars with a mention that I would give them 4.5 is possible but after writing this I think I'm going with the 5 since they are closer to a 4.75.  Seriously, go see them!",1
"5 stars all the way. Considerate, professional and their work is perfect.chad, the manager, will work within your budget to get the work your car needs at competitive labor rates. He is such a sweetheart! Say hello to techs Justin and chad who are very kind and helpful.",1
Always fair and honest service. Quick service times and nice guys. We have used them for years on multiple vehicles.,1
"I have passed by this location for years however I had never stopped to have an actual service done until today. I have gotten plenty of air checks done here but that was about it.  I do still go to the one in North Scottsdale but they will now have serious some competition since they are kinda close to me house (N.Scottsdale is close to work). I must say that every time I have stopped ( yes I know I have only one check-in but I was never here for longer than 5 mins. I mean why check in for an air check?) it has always been after right a mad rush which is AWESOME for me because that means in and out quick. Even the oil changed I received on a Sunday no less, they had me in and out in what 30 mins tops? Crystal, whom I remember from my favorite Scottsdale location works here and she is one bad (as in very good) mechanic/service tech! I so adore her as well as Tim who was a manager.  Any who, If you are ever in the area, stop by get your services done, and keep it moving. They are friendly, fast, fair and they let you know what needs to be done either right then and there or sometime soon.",1
Pat Ruiloba rocks!  My tire had a nail in it on a Sunday and not a lot of places were open.  Pep Boys wanted 125 + for a basic tire.  Firestone.....not!  Quick and kind folks here.  Love!  I'll come back.,1
"I have no complaints. I am new to the world of vision correction. The staff, and Dr. Meek are great. They talked with me, made me feel comfortable and didn't pressure me into high $ frames or lens upgrades.\n\nThey have a decent selection of frames, the office is comfortable, and the people are nice. \n\nThere IS an elevator, if you can't do stairs. It's to the left as you look at the building.",1
"This was my first and last time here. \n\nIn my opinion, the staff was scatterbrained and it took multiple attempts to complete each test before seeing the optometrist. They had to take the retina picture 5 times in one eye and 3 times in the other, talk about seeing spots! When it came to the \""""press the button when you see the squiggly line\"""", I had to do it multiple times as the gal kept spacing out on what she was doing. The simple \""""puff\"""" test was even a chore for them to complete... I had over 4 people in a tiny room trying to do the job of one person and they were succeeding miserably. At this point, I should of left. \n\nDr. Gregory Meek seemed nice enough. He kept saying it was amazing that I could read the last line on the eye chart.  \n\nExam done, time to find frames and order. Now the gal can't measure to order the glasses! She annoyed me so much that I just wanted to pay for the exam and leave. The only person on staff that seemed to know her stuff helped me and measured the glasses and ordered the lenses. \n\nTime to pick up the glasses and they were the cheapest quality lenses that you could order for $29.95 at zennioptical.com with a $20 frame, not pay $190! They were fuzzy and really poor quality. \n\nMy new eye exam script is off, it was made for me to see the computer and reading only! I now have no distance vision and have to start over with another exam to get this corrected! \n\nI have been wearing glasses for 36 years and this was by far the worst experience that I have ever had and recommend you pay a little more for better service and quality.",0
"I was hoping for a spectacular neighborhood diner but it's rather ordinary as far as food, menu, and atmosphere.  I had a full breakfast and everything was just ok, service was just ok, and I don't think they've updated the furniture for decades.  Must be the location that explains their success, and those retired folks sitting up at the counter.",0
"We tried Pinky's for the first time this past week.  While the food was pretty good (better than average), it was the small town feel, the friendliness of the staff, and the old-time decor that drew us in.  It reminded me of a cafe that I worked at in high school.\n\nI ordered the green chile-cheese omelette which was yummy!  The home fries weren't really hot but were tasty just the same.  My husband had the 2 egg-short stack of pancakes, and bacon breakfast.  The pancakes were HUGE...though again not as hot as they should have been.  They wouldn't melt the butter...but they were pretty good just the same.  Scrambled eggs were done perfectly and the bacon was thick and crispy.  Coffee cups were constantly topped off.\n\nWe will be back!",1
"This place was really entertaining for breakfast.  It's a small spot tucked in next to a few other places but it definitely stands out inside.  Once you get inside you will notice 4 things: 1- there is a giant mural of hot air balloons, 2 - there is a giant mural of nyc complete with twin towers, 3 - the awesomely bad 80's restaurant decor, and 4 - the servers look like they are fresh from Jersey Shores.\n\nWe sat down and were immediately greeted by a server who is most likely a long lost relative of Snookie, hair bump, tan and all.  She was very sweet and responsive and didn't waste anyone's time.  She was also particularly patient with the douchey dad behind us who insisted his omelet be made in the most particular fashion.  I simply ordered a waffle with bacon.  FINALLY I can order just a waffle and bacon, and not a waffle with a side of bacon.  The waffle was great, super light and very crispy.  The bacon was pretty good.  It was thick cut and salty, but a little more done than I liked.  I could have asked for it to be done a specific way, so my fault.\n\nIn any event, I would like to come back here if we're around this area and I suggest you try it sometime.",1

"I  would never, never, never take my dog to get groomed there again.  I have a goldendoodle and I told the groomer to NOT shave her and only cut the matts out.  I wanted her to be long!!!!! When I picked up my dog she not only looked horriable they shaved all her hair off to the skin.  I cried when I saw her and I am sick about it.  Megan the groomer should not be grooming dogs.  She is just lazy and did not want to take the time to comb her out.   I have taken her to other groomers with the same amount of matts and they NEVER shave her!!!!!   I just asked for a shampoo and brush out.   NOT a haircut or shave.  My last words to the groomer were just cut them out and make her look cute!!!! My poor dog looks like it is dying!!!! She went from being the cutiest dog ever to being the UGLY!!!!! Please never take your dog to Megan at Lookout Mountain again.  LOVE the vets...Hate the groomers!!!.",0
"I am very concerned with the efficiency and technical ability of this office and staff. I had my cat front-declawed and she limped for a year following the procedure. I recently got a new puppy (aussie) and purchased their \""""puppy package\"""" to get his shots and vaccinations. On one of these visits, Dr. Cook gave my puppy a shot. My puppy did not like this and made a low growl. Dr. Cook grabbed his face and wrestled my puppy on the exam counter. He then proceeded to tell me that my puppy is a bad dog with aggression issues that I'm going to have major problems with. This is absolutely ridiculous...in fact, I wanted to growl and snap at him too. The front office staff has horrible customer service skills and some of the vet techs just don't have a clue. I have since switched vet clinics and myself and my loves have been much happier without LookOut Mountain Vet.",0
"I spoke to Dr. Jeffrey S. Cook today and as usual he helped me with the concerns I had about my dog ' Mr. E. Bay'.  He has always displayed care, concern and a high degree of intelligence and intuition as he has practiced his passion for veterinary medicine.  You see, I have known him for well over 20 years and he has never faultered in my eyes.  Thank you my friend, as always, I am proud of you.  Kathy",1
"Just got my dogs nails cut here. He hates anyone touching his nails and usually cries, bites and flees whenever we try. I was shocked with how quickly the groomer calmed him down and painlessly and efficiently trimmed his nails. It was like magic! There was no wait and the entire process only took 15 minutes. The final perk...only $12! We will never go anywhere else!",1
"I have been adopted by a cat. It's been in the 'hood for months. For the past few weeks it was bunking on my patio furniture at night and would run if I tried to get near, but this past week it started coming into my house for its slumber. So, I figured I best make sure the little guy's healthy (fortunately, it had already been neutered so I don't have to worry about the \""""multiplying like rabbits\"""" phenomenon.). That's what made me think to review Dr. Stewart Cellers and Desert Hills Animal Hospital. \n\nWhen you walk through the door at Desert Hills you are, most often, greeted by a lovely white-haired lady named Lynne. I will never forget her kindness when my cat, Sissy, was hospitalized there for a few days. Lynne took such great care nursing her, always willing to answer my call with a progress report. From her updates, it was clear she was really getting to know MY cat. And, when the end was near for Sissy, the staff at Desert Hills were so supportive and empathetic... taking turns comforting my kitty. I'm so grateful for them! \n\nDr. Cellers is very knowledgeable and willing to take time answering questions. He gives great detail but does not confuse with medical jargon. He explains ALL options, is honest , empathetic and doesn't push. And, when you call for updates or test results, he'll be the one to speak to you directly! \n\nOffice visits/exams are about $30 which, I think, is pretty reasonable. Today, we wound up doing an exam and a full panel of blood work on my yet-to-be-named addition (to make sure all organs are functioning properly, no FIV or feline leukemia, etc.) and it ran about $150. \n\nI wouldn't even consider going some place else!",1
Today I took my new little pup... Winston the Airedale pup to his first puppy check up.. and shots.. I was nervous.. he was nervous.. I pop him in my Beemer .. and he plops his nervous puppy self down on my boo's business shirts to drop at the cleaners.. (oops forgot about that).. and away we go.. the staff at Desert Hills is super nice.. super informative.. and Dr. Sellers is great.. hes gentle.. knowledgable and gave the Sir Winston his shot in a way that he didnt even know.. a bit of puppy treat.. and we were back in the Beemer and away to drop those shirts..,1
"I was able to get a same day appointment for Rudy, my kitty. We walk in and are greeted not only by a friendly staff, but a chubby tabby chilling on the floor. It think his name is Mo and was too precious for words. \n\nAfter filling out the paperwork we are brought back to the waiting room. Rudy doesn't like new people at all so he growled and hissed at just about everybody who looked at him. Dr. Cellers asked our permission before sedating him to take samples. I like that he asked first. While Rudy was knocked out he talked about what may be going on health wise and options. \n\nOne day later we get the results and options of how to proceed. Rudy is now on meds. There prices are extremely reasonable. We are new to Arizona and hope every place we encounter are as wonderful as DHAH.\n\nP.S. Their prices are reasonable.",1
"Absolutely horrible.  Dr. cellars treated my dog for 11 years.  About 4 years ago my dog was in a grooming accident. His eye was lacerated. He needed med for his eye for the rest of his life.  When I contacted pets mart to file a claim, Dr cellars told them there was nothing wrong with my dog. Also 6 months after filling his ongoing prescription, Dr cellars denied a refill even though the prescription was less than a year and he knew it was ongoing.  His new staff treats everyone like garbage. DO NOT USE THIS VET",0
"we recently tried this vet with our two new kittens and can honestly say I have never been to a vet office with people as genuine, caring, and attentive as the entire staff here. Because of this, we decided pretty quickly we were going to switch to this vet from our old one. I totally trust Dr. Cellers opinion and he thoroughly explains reasons behind any treatment your pet may need. I also love that they post pictures of all the new baby clients on the bulletin board so you can watch how much they grow! Sooo cute! I also have to say that their prices are the most reasonable and competitive I have seen. They even offered to let us pay half of our kitten package upfront and then the rest at a later appointment since we were paying for two kitties. I thought this was very accommodating and considerate since even the most general vet bills can get pricey! Thanks for giving us a home we can trust Desert Hills! Your passion for the care of animals is not only apparent but appreciated!",1
"They might have a similar menu and setup to Chipotle, but the food is NO BUENO!!!  \n\nThere is just something about it that's not good.  I don't know if the chicken that totally lacks texture or the corn chips that taste more like corn oil.  I want so bad to like this place because it's close to my house.  I have tried to go there like three times now, and I won't be back.\n\nSorry!",0
"This place is gross. There is nothing fresh about this Mexican grill. The corn tortillas were of the crispy pre-folded taco shell variety only, all of the salsa looked and tasted like it came out of a Sysco can, and the lettuce had that spinachy taste that lettuce tends to get about two days after you're supposed to throw it away. \n\nYou'll get an infinitely better meal if you go to the Chili's across the parking lot, which is really kind of sad.",0
"Could be better.  I would like to give it a higher rating but just can't.  The food is mostly tasteless and sloppy.  The price is right, but I've noticed whenever I've been there that the staff is stand-offish and unfriendly.  I won't be going there again....",0
"The food here is good, I work nearby so I usually come here about once a week. The staff is friendly and they have a CD that usually plays in the background containing a spanish version of the song \""""Achey Breakey Heart\"""", which is just as bad as the original even though I can't understand the words. The portions are large, there is a full salsa bar and for the price you get a great meal. I'd recommend it.",1
"I have always had fresh food here. The service is nice and simple. \n\nI had the 2 Spicy tacos in soft corn shells, with cheese, sour cream, pico and lettuce. Served with chips and a drink for under 6 bucks. \n\nThe meat was good, not too spicy at all, the chips were a little greasy but I like that and the salsa bar was good. None of the salsa's were over the top good or hot. I suggest getting the \""""super hot\"""" from the people before you sit down. \n\nThe place was clean and the price was excellent.",1
"I drove by this place several times hoping to get a chance to check it out.  I guess sometimes you have to be careful what you wish for because it might come true. \n\nThe service was OK, all 4 of the ladies standing in the tiny kitchen behind the oddly oriented ordering wall just seemed indifferent about the whole process.  \n\nThe food was...teetering between tasteless and wishing it was more tasteless.  I could make a better taco and burrito at home with a bag of co-jack and an Old El Paso box kit.  My daughter and I left without finishing our food.\n\nOne bonus star for not getting sick from anything.",0
"I went to Sabroso Fresh Mexican Grill with my son for dinner and it wasn't a good experience. Definitely not kid friendly...the options for the kids meals were not healthy at all or fresh for that matter. The woman taking my order seemed rude and inpatient and she ended up getting my order wrong. The restaurant was a mess the tables were dirty and a lot of trash on the floor. The food was the worst Mexican food I've ever had, I ordered the barbacoa tacos and the meat was cold it wasn't even warm. This place was anything but sabroso. Which in spanish means delicious...if they had less than a star I would give them just that.",0
"I always see coupons for this place and today I found it and gave it a try. My first impression walking in was \""""eh\"""" could be better, could be worse. The service, however- Couldn't get any worse. I've had days when I wanted to be anywhere but work, but this chick behind the counter was so angry/annoyed to be there it was coming off her in waves!\n\n I ordered a spicy chicken burrito that was BLECH!!! Nothing good about that thing. I also ordered a mini steak quesadilla. She made me a full sized instead. This turned out to be a good thing since the burrito was awful. The quesadilla was pretty darn good! Needless to say I wont come near this place ever again.",0
"How can a eatery get mexican food SO wrong?!!\n\nI had a bad feeling when I walked in and the lady was looking at us like \""""what are you doing here!?!!!?  Don't you know the food sucks and you will get sick???\""""\n\nWell.. I got a fajita burrito and the peppers and onions were boiled.  The chicken was bland. My girl's tacos were crummy too.\n\nIf ever a reason to go there I guess the chips and salsa are ok. That would give it a star. But otherwise... I would never advise this place.  Sorry. I hate to be mean. I always try to find something good about an eatery. This place was hard to find anything good.",0

"We visited this place today for the first time.  We've driven by it countless times, on our way to Target, or Chipotle.  We had an Entertainment Book coupon so we decided to check it out.  BIG mistake.\n\nThe service was really terrible.  The ladies behind the counter were pretty rude, and obviously did not want to be working there.  The salsa bar was disgusting, with warm salsa (!) which had little to no taste, if that's even possible.  We ordered a barbacoa burrito, a bean and cheese burrito and a kids' quesadilla.  Only the quesadilla was edible.  We are Mexican food aficinados, but this was truly gross food.  (I have an iron stomach and got extremely sick within an hour of eating the barbacoa burrito.)\n\nThe icing on the cake of our visit, so to speak, was the cheap wicker type seats on the chairs.  Two nasty splinters became embedded in our young daughter's knit pants/rear end, causing her to cry in pain.  Nice.",0
Horrible. Do not go. The staff doesnt pay attention to your orders or care at all. All the food is watery & lacking real flavor. Even the salsa is pretty crappy. I'd rather eat my own fingernails!,0
"Do you love big sloppy pieces of pork fat covered in barbecue sauce? If so please come here!!\n\nI'll be as nice as I can since I've only been here once and only had one item.   \n\nI had open faced pork sandwich with a side of coleslaw.   The pork was sliced thin but was 50% fat. and no, not just one piece of pork but the entire plate of it, yuck!\n\nThey must have forgot to add the dressing to the coleslaw because it was bone dry.  Yummy, I love raw plain cabbage! How did they know?\n\nI'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say I just got a bad hunk of meat because there is no way this place could serve food like that and stay in business.  \n\nIf they change their name to \""""My Big Plate of Pork Fat with Sauce\"""" it would better suit the meal I was served.\n\n---Re-reading my own review and now I'm pissed that I didn't send it back, I should have damn it!",0
"I've been here several times, always expecting it to be better than it ever actually is.  I could complain about the prices, but I think my cousin and I simply agree that all BBQ joints are overpriced.\nSo I'll complain about the food.  And the service.  I went in the late afternoon and the place was empty.  Our waitress looked sweaty and kinda high.  We missed the lunch menu (which actually only has 2 items) so we both ordered dinners.  My pulled pork was good enough and my okra was milliseconds away from being carbon.  We both inexplicably had to pay extra for the side orders that we chose to go with our meals.  My cousin said the cornbread (an extra 75 cents for no apparent reason) was the best she'd ever had at a restaurant and she enjoyed the hot links but when our bill came to over $30 we both thought that was about $15 too much.  My bbq beans were alright, nothing special.  I wish I had just ordered their \""""special\"""", seasoned waffle fries topped with pulled bbq, cheese, and jalapenos.  \nOur waitress finished up her performance by adding up our bill incorrectly.   I'm on the fence whether or not to just ban the restaurant from my list of possibilities...I love bbq but ugh.",0
"Now, being from the Midwest, I LOVE a good hunk of BBQ... and like Mathew, I didn't get that here. My friend and i were running errands and decided we wanted a quick BBQ lunch. The place was empty. We were the only people in the entire place. \n\nI have to say, the service was excellent... but it turned out that the guy who waited on us was the older brother of a kid I know, so we may have gotten preferential treatment. I suspect that they are just as attentive to strangers though. The place is very clean and comfortable in a tile meets pleather kind of way, but the food was way below my standards. \n\nI spent the whole time picking through the meat to find a few bites that were not filled with fat. It's too bad that they are willing to serve such fatty meat because the sauce and the side dishes were great.  If only the main dish had been as good as the waiter and the rest of the food.",0
The last time I went I was sooo happy with the food now I'm sooo sad. The day before New Yrs Eve I was craving some good BBQ. I promised myself no more meat except fish starting New Years. So this was pretty much my last hoorah. I was looking forward to it ALL day!! I had a burnt ends sandwich with fries and onion rings. Well I couldn't even finish the sandwich! It was dry and tough and tasted pretty salty. About half way through my stomach started crying for help. I felt like dude on Man Vs. Food I was determined to eat it but it turned awful. I had to stop eating and I thought I was going to die. I had a gallon of tea after that and luckily pulled through alive. Not at all like last time. NOT ONE BIT!! Oh fries were not good either not like McD's they were pretty greasy more like Two Hippies but without the thickness. Onion rings were ok  meh nothing to write about.\n\nStill sad about the whole thing!,0
"We were hoping to find some good BBQ here, but this was a big disappointment.  We got take out, beef brisket and pulled pork, a side of fried okra and side of coleslaw.   The staff was pleasant enough.  The coleslaw was pretty good, almost good enough to make me bump this review up a star.  The okra was nothing special, but probably didn't benefit from the few minutes in transit between frying and eating.\n\nBut the beef and the pork were a huge disappointment.  For one thing, it was hard to tell which was which(!)  Both were sliced extremely thin like they had been cut on a deli slicer.  I seriously doubt the beef was brisket, as it was dry and lean.  Very little smoke flavor to the meat, and the sauce was lacking in flavor with an oddly metallic note to it.\n\nI hate to give a one star rating but BBQ is all about the meat, and the meat was ... just not good.  I don't know, maybe this was a fluke given that not all the reviews here are negative.  But I don't think there's any way we're trying them again.",0
"I just moved here from Kansas and have been looking for a good BBQ joint.  We ordered the lunch special, which was a choice of a beef or pork sandwich with coleslaw and fries. We also got an order of rib tips. The food took forever, and there were only two other couples there. The  sandwich was tiny and served on a regular hamburger bun. The fries were average, and the coleslaw had zero flavor. The rib tips were cold inside. When I told the waitress, she apologized and said that they come frozen. She said that they get steamed before coming out.  I couldn't believe that a BBQ restaurant would have frozen meat. WTH?  This place was so disappointing.  I will not be coming back.",0
"Came here with friends to satisfy a bbq craving.  When we walked in there was only one other customer with her baby but we didn't think much of it because it was a holiday and most businesses were dead.\n\nThey didn't have much selection but I went with the bbq chicken sandwich, and my friends got the beef ribs and brisket.  Nothing was fantastic.  \n\nMy bbq chicken sandwich was dry... I had to pour on bbq sauce.  I guess they forgot that it was a BBQ sandwich.  My friends ribs were unsatisfactory... mainly just a big bone with lots of fat.  She tried her best to get good meat off of it but it was scarce.  The brisket was not what I think of when I think of brisket.  I think of tender meat that melts in your mouth.... this just looked like roast beef on a plate.  \n\nI got a side order of cornbread but it was so dry that I couldn't get much of it down :(  So sad because I looooove cornbread.\n\nWe also got dessert- peach cobbler.  Tasted more like apple crisp which really confused my pallet.... but I guess I wasn't expecting much at this point.\n\nI'll be looking for other bbq restaurants to fulfill any future bbq cravings because this place just didn't do it for me.",0
"I had been wanting to have barbeque for awhile. This was the only place that was close to me. I had read the bad to average reviews, but still decided to give it a shot.  That was a mistake. There was no other customers inside and the food was incredibly bland. \n\nI decided to go with the 2 meat dinner combo. It ran just under $15. I went with pork ribs and sausage. For my sides I had Mac & Cheese and baked beans. The thing that had the most taste was was the baked beans and they tasted like they came straight from a can.  \n\nI would not recommend going here to anyone. I personally will not be going back.",0
Had the brisket and the bbq beef sandwich + sides.  Everything was no good.  The meat was dry the sides were bland.  If you're looking for good BBQ in the Phoenix area I recommend Honey Bears or Bobby Q's.,0
"In summary, don't go here.  I checked out this place on a whim and it was the mistake of the weekend.\n\nI picked up the curry combo plate because I was hoping to try the different types of food they have.  The fried rice was simply rice with soy sauce and maybe somewhat fried?  The noodles they had were pretty bland.  The curry was really bland and watery.",0
"My wife and I tried this place while waiting for a prescription @ the CVS down the street. We should have gone to DQ instead. I had the Yui-Shan Shrimp which was terrible. A flavorless sauce with tons of mushy green peppers and a few bamboo shoots sprinkled throughout. My wife had the Kung Pao Shrimp, which tasted like ketchup and soy sauce, there was no pao to be had. The egg roll was the best part, and only because it was packed with black pepper did it have any taste. We split an order of crab puffs, which were so tiny and overcooked there was maybe one small bite from each piece. The table setting was outrageous! Cloth napkins and delicately placed flowers gave me the sense that the Queen Mother was coming for a visit at any time. I politely paid the bill and left a tip, and will NEVER return there.",0
Incredibly expensive and it took a hour and a half to get it to my door. Then once we got it we found out that they dont deliver won ton soup for take out but its on their menu! Then the food was yuck! I have had allot of Chinese food in my 44 years! This has to be the worst!\n\nI gave one star just cause we did not get sick!  But short of that I would give zero stars if I could. That's how bad the food and the service was.,0
"While this food did not make me Kim Jong Il by any means and I don't particularly LIKE Chinese even....steer clear of this place. This was not my choice but it is nearby and unsuspecting hungry people may fall into the trap of ordering some delivery from here especially around the holiday's. Here is your warning. The food was bland no flavor, orange chicken was soggy, pot stickers were the worst I have ever had and I LOVE potstickers PEOPLE!! Chow mein was watery and tasteless. The ONLY thing that was decent was the crab puffs so next time I crave them I just might order them and maybe try some soup. What can I say I might be a glutton for punishment. ;)\n\nOh also when visiting this shopping mall which I have done many many times this place is pretty much empty except for maybe lunch. FYI.",0
If want a list of place to stay away. this is one of them. I think my one star tell you how I feel about this pit.,0
"Ordered delivery from here for dinner.  The lady on the phone had trouble understanding my address and despite repeating my credit card # back to me she apparently didn't run the charge through because the girl who delivered the food was expecting payment when she got here.  They had a heck of a time sorting it out and ended up needing my card # again.  I'm a little nervous about what they did with it when they wrote it down the first time.  The delivery girl was very nice though.\n\nThe food was mediocre.  We ordered dinner combos.  I got sweet and sour pork and my husband got teriyaki chicken.  The combos come with fried wontons, eggrolls, fried rice, and lo mien.  The egg rolls were horrible but I liked the fried wontons.  My husband said the lo mien is better than Panda Express (I agree) but the teriyaki chicken was not better than Panda Express.  The sweet and sour sauce was good but on delivery orders they should leave the sauce on the side so the breading on the pork doesn't get mushy.  If you order an order of fried rice it's a lot better than the stuff that comes with the combo.\n\nOverall the food was ok but it's not something I would order again.",0
"Our favorite Chinese place in town! We love their pork fried rice, beef & broccoli (yum!!), and sesame chicken. The dumplings are also great. We really appreciate that they deliver to our house, and fairly quickly!",1
"Used to go here years ago and the old management got a little cheap on portions size. Not anymore. The place has really turned around and food tastes great! Good bang for the buck on portion size. Egg drop soup is great! Since we rediscovered the Dragon Bowl, we haven't had a bad meal yet!",1
"We ordered take out for a family celebration yesterday and were pleasantly surprised.  We hadn't found good Chinese food nearby, and this is our new place.  The pork fried rice was yummy.  The orange chicken and sesame chicken were both good.  The Mongolian beef was not exactly what we're used to, but it was tender and tasty.   The egg rolls are on the small side, but good.  The chicken chop suey was very nice, too.  The order arrived much sooner than expected, and everything was nice and hot.  We will definitely be ordering from Dragon Bowl again!",1
"I came across this restaurant while visiting Mashawi Lebanese Grill just a door or two down; and after checking out the menu online; have made two trips to the restaurnt; as well as ordered take-out/delivery.  There are no bargains on the menu save the daily luncheon specials - which truly are a bargain.  That said - the quality and quantity of the food fairly reflect the price.  Each meal I've ordered is more than enough for two; and I'm 6'9\"""" and 250 pounds.  Exceptionally clean, immaculate tabletops, linen napkins.  They clearly do a booming takeout business from my observation while dining in the restaurant.  A minor criticism - the server seems a it surly; maybe becuase she always seems so busy.",1
"Just moved into neighborhood and found this restaurant on yelp. We were greeted immediately by friendly staff and we belief owners were working. The food was hot, flavorful and price was very reasonable. There was a steady stream of customers and they acknowledge their regulars. They have take-out and do delivery which is a bonus.",1
"Brought 4 pair of slacks in, 2 zipper replacements and 2 to be hemmed. When I went to pick them up, only one pair was ready for pick up.  The pants that needed to be hemmed were not done as I had requested. On one of the pants that was going to have the zipper replaced, the didn't have a matching color but no one bothered to contact me to see if I wanted to do something else instead.  I'll never go there again!",0
"I looked on Yelp and other sites to find reviews on a good dry cleaners for my husband's business suits. I come to find out, there are few in my area that are up to par. So I knew this one was on the way home so I thought I would give it a try after reading a few other reviews on other sites. (which remain nameless --hehe). \n\nI noticed there was a drive up window which would be convenient for the possible next time I was to return. (For I wouldn't want to go thru on the first visit, so I could check out the establishment.).  I entered the cleaners and was greeted warmly by the guy behind the counter. Seemed very clean inside and very busy -- based on all the clothes getting carted around on that 'roller coaster of rails' they ride on. (a good sign!). The gentleman reviewed what items I had and gave me a ticket. For 2 suits and a blazer, it would only take 2 days to clean. Not too bad. The cost was $26.25. Now I've never dry cleaned suits before, so I hope that was reasonable? Not sure.  ($9.75 each suit and $6.75 for the blazer). If not, oh well, we'll see how good this place is and check on prices in other places to compare.\n\nSo after 2 days I picked up the garments. Once again, greeted warmly by a younger gentleman. I commend them for their happy demeanor. You don't get that a lot anymore. I showed him my ticket and he retrieved my items very quickly. I reviewed them briefly and asked him about cleaning dresses, and fixing hems. He gave me some prices and said the seamstress would be more than happy to give me a quote on the repair. I didn't have the dress so I would stop by at a later time. \n\nWhen I got home, I inspected the items further. The slacks were pressed perfectly and there was no odor or anything on the clothing. (As I've heard sometimes happens at dry cleaners) So I was pleased.\n\nI would definitely go there again for my dry cleaning.",1
I'm new to the area.  They were nice and the drive through window is convenient.  However- they are terribly expensive!!  And I just relocated here from the East coast.  This was ridiculous.  Every garment has it's own price- and women's blouses are more expensive to clean than men's.  And they only accept Mastercard and Visa unless you pay for the monthly service.  Very shocked at the bill when I went to collect my clothes.  Where are the flat rate cleaners???,0
"Full trash bins, over charged for free drink with sandwich purchase, unfriendly man working today.  \n\nThis is not what I am used to for a QT.",0
"I bypass two other gas stations just to go to this one. They always have open pumps, everything is well-kept and clean, and the store is well-stocked with a variety of options. The attendants are friendly and move through lines incredibly quickly, especially at high busy times (early morning, right after a work day ends).\n\nOverall: A\nIt may just be a gas station, but QuikTrip always proves itself to be a good stop off in the realm of fill ups.",1
I enjoy searching cemetery records for my genealogy. I found National Memorial Cemetery of Arizona and the listings for all of my other cemetery searches here http://interment.net/data/us/az/maricopa/national/index.htm,1
"Very inconsistent food and service. Sometimes good, but 80% of the time they screw up part of my order.",0
So its Friday and I work hard all week and it has been a thing for the last month or two to have pizza every friday night and the kids love it\nWell needless to say I haven't had Domino's in quite some time so I downloaded the app to order a pizza for pick up which didn't work so I ended up having to call to get the price of the quoted special for the pizza. When I pulled up I noticed the bar next door and there was loud people and smoking and sounded like a few guys arguing so definitely not a place you want to take your kids for picking up pizza. The pizza was the main reason for the trip to Domino's especially since it's a few blocks from my house so why pay the extra 5 to 6 dollars for delivery. We got the 2 medium 2 topping pizzas and 16 parmesan bread bites the pizza had hardly any sauce and the crust was really greasy like they slapped too much of the butter flavor on it and wasn't all to appetizing as a family we can eat 2 medium pizzas no problem especially being that we have hungry kids but there is still a whole pizza left over rare for our family on pizza night. The bread bites didn't come with sauce so I paid the extra 75 cents for a cup of the most awful tasting marinara sauce and the bites were greasy and so salty it was hardly edible.\nSo on a fair note being that the cheese was the only thing good about the pizza give this Domino's 2 stars and I won't be going back probably for another year or so just to remind myself why we never order from Domino's.,0
"Deer Creek Animal Hospital is a big, beautiful and modern facility. Super friendly crew of animal lovers, instills confidence that your pet is in good hands. Behind the office counter were several dogs and cats lounging around contently, and in harmony. Proving the atmosphere at Deer Creek is all about the pets. When I arrived to pick up my pet from his procedure, I was escorted back to the recovery kennels to retrieve my pet with the assistant. That was a nice touch I thought. Also shows, there is nothing to hide. Check out was an experience too. I was briefed with great detail, and in no way rushed. All my questions answered with due attention. I received post-op instructions, custom printed for my pet and his recovery!  \n  There is also a well stocked and appointed feed/accessory store within. Roomy and well lit, nicely planned, not an afterthought in the corner as is so typical.\nYeah, I'm impressed, and I'll be back.",1
"I would gladly recommend Deer Creek Animal Hospital to my friends! I never feel like I'm being pressured to buy more than I need to, which is such a relief as compared to other places I've been. \n\nLuckily we don't go often, but whenever we are there the staff is very friendly and the Dr. is very honest and gentle with my dog. Two paws up for this place!",1
They staff is awesome!  I can get my dogs in the same day if I need to.  They also offer doggie daycare and boarding.  My dogs love going there!  They an acre of grassy area for the dogs to run around in as well as letting the dogs roam around the office during office hours.,1
"I can't say enough positive about Deer Creek Animal Hospital. I have been going to them with my pets for about 3 years now. I have boarded my dog there several times and she always comes home happy and totally worn out from play time. I understand the need for a flea/tick dip after boarding, but I think the price plus the requirement for a dose of Frontline is a little high. Still, my dog loves it there and it is the only place I'll leave her. \n\nAs far as vet services, they are excellent. I recently had to put my cat down after 15 years together. I came home from work to find him unable to move and I called the vet at 4:45. I was so relieved when they told me to come right in with him. Dr. Robbins assisted us with seeing my old boy safely to the Rainbow Bridge. Her words of comfort and a hug afterward meant the world to me. And then a few days later, I received a sympathy card signed by all the staff with a personal note from Dr. Robbins. I feel like Dr. Robbins and her team always go above and beyond. This is, by far, the best vet's office I've ever known.",1
"We have 5 dogs and have been using Deer Creek for vet services, as well as grooming, for over a year now.  They are always helpful and answer all of our questions.  They also have boarding and day care.  If there were ever I time I needed those services, I would feel almost as comfortable letting my fur babies stay there as I would with one of my relatives.  The staff is caring and does a great job.",1
"I have taken my dog here for extended boarding twice.  Both times he was sick when I picked him up.  The latest illnesses include mange.  If you love your pet, go somewhere else.  The place is dirty, and they are indifferent to anything except charging for extra services.",0
Best animal hospital in Phoenix.  Always honest and up front about costs and never pushy about procedures and tests.  Dr. Robbins is the best vet and has taken care of our two dogs for years - Dr. K and Higgins are great too.  And don't forget the gals and guys at the front desk - the best.,1
Tri and Lauren and Kate and the rest of the staff are truly amazing at what they do. They sincerely care about the animals that are brought in for care whether for a vet treatment or for boarding. I trust them completely with my furry members of my family.,1
"I just had a final horrible experience at this animal hospital. I've have gone here thankfully a handful of times, and each time I'd been surprised at the lack of friendliness, expensive fees and long wait times in the exam room. But it is nearby and I did not change vets. On this visit I went and was shown to a wait room, and was told the vet would be in shortly. I had my 2 year old toddler with me and the dog, waiting patiently, knowing there would be a wait, but of course this wait went on and on and on and on. After 20 minutes, I poked my head out the door and asked if the doctor could come soon since I also had a toodler in the room with me. Then I turned back in and my toddler had climbed on the seat next to the exam table and fell off and bumped her head. I expressed that I shouldn't have to wait so long, and that this isn't the first time and they had their doctor reasons but this does not change that they charge a large fee like all doctors for a short amount of time and the least they could do is not make people wait so long and have a little care and respect for their clientle. I spoke to the office manager and she refused to extend any courtsey for the incident due to the long wait. Needless to say, I will not give them my business again and I think you should think twice about visiting this place!",0
"Last week, my cat was attacked by a dog and Deer Creek was the closest place, (I had never been there before). It was by far the most horrifying experience I have been through, but Dr. Robbins and the staff made it as easy as it could have been. I read some of the other reviews before writing this one, and someone mentioned Dr. Robbins seemed like a dog person. When she told me the news about how Stella was doing she was in tears and I could see it was very hard for her to give me bad news. We ended up having to put Stella down and every member of the staff that was around was in tears. I'm sure they see this a lot, but I don't and this was my baby and they really made me feel as good as I could in that situation about the decision I was making. \nWe are going to board our dog there when we go out of town in a couple weeks and also try their training classes if they have any available, I just felt very comfortable there, and like I was in good hands.\nOh, and the night we put Stella down, Dr. Robbins called me to check on me and tell me how sorry she was. That really meant a lot.",1
"Deer Creek takes such good care of my dog Rusty.  Rusty is a pretty big, strong dog but very fearful of vet offices.  We have taken Rusty for boarding services at Deer Creek several times and everyone has been so patient with him.  The associates have spent extra time with him in an effort to help him feel safe.  They have just \""""understood\"""" that Rusty needed time and never made me feel ashamed of his nervous behavior (and believe me, other vet offices have made us feel that way).  During his last visit, Rusty had such a breakthrough that the tech pulled out his cell phone and took video to show me how happy Rusty was. He and another tech could not wait to show us the video when we got back from our vacation.  Now that is caring!\n\nAlso thank you to Dr. James who treated Rusty for allergies.  She was so patient with me and my questions but also with Rusty' s need to go slow through his appointment.\n\nWe are so glad that we found Deer Creek!",1
Sketchy Doggie day care. I would advise to look somewhere else if you are looking for your dog to be watched and not involved in negative behavioral socialization.,0
"I had a pedicure at this place today. The prices are excellent. I paid $22 for the best pedicure I can ever remember getting and I have paid $60+ in some places. I kept expecting to pay more thinking they must be giving me the deluxe pedi instead of the basic one but nope the one I got was the basic one. I'm not even sure what they might add if they have a deluxe pedi accept maybe a paraffin dip or an herbal wrap?\nThey have an attractive clean facility. They actually line the basin where your feet go with a plastic liner that they change between customers, now that is clean! The chairs themselves look brand new. I got the longest foot massage I have ever had with a pedi even when I paid for a so-called deluxe or spa pedi elsewhere. My toes looked great when they were done. I was offered a bottle of water to drink while I waited. I know some places will give you wine, coffee etc but this is not a spa and for that price I am more than happy with water (besides I have to drive).\nBtw, they have male clients as well. In case you guys want to experience one of the things that makes it great to be a woman. \nThe staff was so pleasant and most of them are English speaking. What more could you ask for? Hanna was the girl that did my feet but I saw the others working and they all seemed to do quality work. I am so excited that I found a great affordable place to get some regular pedicures while I'm here. If I can only find a good massage around here I will be in heaven. \nI give them 5 stars because they are better than any spa I have ever been to and a third the price.",1
"After a lot of begging and convincing, me and my boyfriend decided to get pedicures together. I searched for places close to home and after reviewing Fancy Nails decided to give it a shot. We got there and all the techs and who seemed to be the owner or manager made us feel very welcomed. The place was clean and inviting. We got to the chairs which were probably the nicest chairs I've seen in a while and I loved that the spa pedi bowls had one use plastic liners that are disposed of after every single use. My massage was AMAZING!!! and the polish and selection was good!!! I was very happy and even my boyfriend said when we were finished \""""that was awesome, we need to do that a lot more\"""" SCORE ;)",1
I love the work they do and they're cheap!!!! So worth the trip!,1
"I recently moved to this salon after 5 years somewhere else that was close by. This salon is great. Great prices, very clean and great service. The techs dont sit on their phone the entire time you are there :) I will be ditching the other salon and using this place from now on! Great find. Highly recommend!",1
"love this nail salon. i read the reviews on yelp and decided to try.  each experience has been positive, i've been going every 2-3 weeks since march.  i generally get a pedicure and gel manicure.  I haven't had the same technician twice but i always walk out happy with my nails and toes and get loads of compliments.  \n\nthe have great selection of gel/ shellac/ gelish polishes, can almost always find colors that match the regular polish near perfectly. prices are good, they have different pedicure choices you can add on and different types of pedicures to encompass all their different services. \n\ngo during the week!  their weekends are insanely busy, you will have to wait and your services are good, but much better during the week.  that being said they like to take their time during the week.  sometimes its helpful to let them know you have a bit of a time crunch.  (my last gel manicure and pedicure i was there for just over 90 minutes)  i appreciated the time and enjoyed the break, but i know sometimes that much time is too much to spare.",1
"Very happy with service. Hubs and i had pedi here, we were not disappointed. Good service and price.  We will b going again.",1
This place is so clean. They engage you and talk directly to you and no cross talking. The owner runs a tight ship and you can tell. I really like coming here and always leave satisfied. They do such a good job. A spa pedi is only 22 and its amazing. Go here!,1
"I'm only in Phoenix visiting, and this salon is by far one of the best I have seen. I wish I lived here so I could come get my nails done here more often. They have complimentary coffee and tea at the entrance :) They have great service too! Ask for Kim or Steven to do your nails!",1
Very impressed... Hannah did a great job.  I love the disposable liners for pedicures.  The only drawback was that I had to wait about 35 minutes for the appointment I made in advance.. But I would certainly recommend!,1
"WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN! Unprofessional. Disloyal. Rude. Lazy. After giving this place and my nail tech Kim business for over a year, I was turned away today because I like my nails buffed too much. Seriously? You mean you don't want to \""""work\"""" for the money I pay you. WTF? I've never been so insulted. And I'm not even a difficult client. In the year I've been going here, Kim has barely said two words to me (which is Ok. I just want my nails done). I continued to go back week after week because she was good. Six months ago I walked in without an appt and let someone else do my nails. Mistake. She cut me and the buff was awful. Kim actually stepped over to finish the job. And I tip well for good service. \n\nSo understand how floored I was when I was told today Kim doesn't want to work on me any more. I was told her arm hurts too much after buffing my nails and she feels awkward. You're kidding, right? Now, if I was a jerk customer; demanding, loud, lousy tipper, etc I can see it. But I'm none of that. In fact, when I find what I like, I'm loyal. And I've been loyal here. And I pay without complaint. And I tip well, always. That's why I'm so pissed to have been turned away because the job is too difficult. That's just lazy! Yes, L-A-Z-Y!!! You perform a service. I pay you money. I have the right to be particular. You have the responsibility to do your job well. Today, they lost a customer and a fan. What happened today was BS. \n\nI will NEVER recommend this business. I'm disappointed I can't give a zero star or negative star rating. Fancy Nails gets a big middle finger from me!",0
Best nail salon I've been to in the Valley. I never have to wait. I don't ask for anyone in particular because every person who has done my nails has been fabulous. The polish lasts for longer than any salon I've been to. Love this place!!,1
"Very disappointed with the pedicure I received. It was extremely rushed and lacked the sentiment of pampering yourself and relaxing. It was not meticulously done and there was nail polish left on my skin. I  can definitely do a better job myself. \n\nIn addition to that, the nail technician cut my big toenail at an angle to the inside on each side of the nail, and it looks absolutely ridiculous. It was only that one nail so my overall pedicure is inconsistent. I brought it to her attention even though there was nothing she could do to change it and she brushed it off and said that's how it's done.",0
"My wife and I banked at B of A for years. Then we noticed that they were getting bigger and bigger and dipping their fingers in all different kinds of enterprises. It seemed that they were making their customers their last priority, while doing a lot of shady deals to boost their bottom line. It reminded us of that movie \""""The International\"""" from a few years back. B of A is so big and powerful, it wouldn't surprise me if they were manipulating countries to start wars in order to profit from them. We grew disgusted with everything that they stood for. Which is why we started banking with Desert Schools. Desert Schools has a long history in the valley, and we've known many people that have been satisfied customers for a long time. Switching all of our direct deposits and auto-debits was actually easier than I thought. We just had to peruse our bank records to see the recurring transactions and make a few quick calls to those companies. Desert Schools has also made some technological strides even in the few years that we've been banking with them. They have a great mobile app and their ATMs accept the envelope-free cash and check deposits. If you need to go inside and talk to someone they are relatively quick, whether you're talking to a teller or an account specialist. I had an issue a few months back where a cable company in Florida debited my account for another customers bill. I initially thought it was fraud, so I called Desert Schools to inform them. Within minutes of placing the call I was talking to a live person in Phoenix and he was securing my account so another transaction from that company couldn't go through. With B of A, or another bank of that size, I guarantee that it would have been a half-day process for the same situation. If you want a local, personal bank that can do all of your banking efficiently and technologically-forward, then Desert Schools is a good way to go.",1
Dilly bar. Say it with me. Dilly bar.,1
"Surly old lady working the counter on my day and believe me, I caught the vibe quite clearly and won't be back.  Ice cream didn't taste quite right, and the Blizzard ingredients seemed stale and unchewable.  Yuck.  Tummy gurgles for an hour after consumption.  Not good.",0
Great prices and fresh food ...,1
"I LOVE this place! The owners have created a place that I now think of as my \""""Cheers\"""".

What a joke this is a strip club? It's close to the worst strip club I've ever been to. I'm pretty sure I would have had a better time thrown money at hookers for nothing on Van Buern and driving off and watching them fight over the money. The Great Alaskan Bush Company is the only place I'll try or go to next time I'm in the Phx area! This place is way over crowded and I have no Idea why.,0
"I've been here maybe ten times, or so, over the past ten or so years.  I've gone in a Limo with a group of, gulp, conservative couples, with \""""normal\"""" couples (like I set the bar), a couple of times with the \""""boys,\"""" and, shamelessly, by myself once (i was going through a tough time).\n\nFive dollar cover for men.  Ladies free. Drinks start at $4 and go up.  Nice bar tenders and waitresses.  Bathrooms clean, but they smell, like, well, a strip club bathroom.\n\nLots of pretty dancers.  Not bitchy.  Not pretentious.  Little boobies, big boobies, saggy boobies.  No pasties, and tiny tiny G strings.  One large area and one smaller area.  Some sort of back room, I suppose for when they rent a donkey, or some little people from the circus, but I've never seen it used.  One pool table, which I have actually played on.  They have chalk.\n\nMy wife has been here for that strange ritual they call \""""girls night out.\"""" and had a good time with the ladies.  Again, a harmless friendly bar, with couples, lesbians, single horny fellows...which just happens to have a couple of poles and nice women swinging around on them.  Very nice girls, even after you tell them \""""no thank you\"""" five times.  VERY good wait staff.\n\nNot raunchy, but one of my \""""conservative\"""" friends wife, from the south (duh), who ventured here with us several years ago, had a breakdown in the parking lot.  It was awesome.  Her husband was refused service because he was too shit faced to walk straight, and she was sobbing as though the FDA was going to take her anti depressive off the market.  She was disturbed that men had access to topless women so easily, as though the dancers were for \""""hire.\""""  FYI, don't go here with conservative 40 year old women.  Do not go here if you're afraid to see boobies, it's a titty bar.  DO go here if you want to have a light evening finisher before taking your partner(s) home for...breakfast.\n\nBring cash, I'm pretty sure even the bar doesn't take plastic.  They do have an ATM, however (that's convenient).",1
Cheap entry fees and $5 lap dances are amazing.  Chill place to hang out. Been with my girlfriend and she loves it and has always had a great time.,1
"I went to a strip club in Mexico once and had a memorable experience. One that I've tried to replicate for many years after.\n\nThe stripper, who was very cute and also very proud of her lactating skills, would for all of a buck hastily whip out one of her tits on demand, squeeze it, and shoot a stream of milk at you. \nShe reminded me of drunk me, peeing in a parking lot someplace...waving my stream around until I've spelled out my name.  \n\nPeople...now that's entertainment!\n\nAs compared with the Candy Store, where some dumb-as-a-bag-of-hammers stripper who's all too willing to spend a few thousand bucks on breast implants while badly in need of dental implants, snubs you because the black-light illumination is prominently displaying  the pee stain on your cargo shorts. \n\nThe Candy Store.\nNice boobs.\nBad grilles.\nAnd girls with no fundamental lactating / squirting abilities, which they should possess since most are single moms. \n\nA disappointment on every level.",0
"Husband and I were out with some friends on Saturday night and decided to hit this place up around 9pm. When we rolled in we were SHOCKED at the $5 cover charge! Who else has it so cheap???? GREAT START to our evening! :)\n\nWe easily found some nice seats on couches towards the back but the place is smallish so we had awesome views of the larger stage. It was kinda disappointing with the first couple dancers because they seemed to be more interested in staring at themselves in the mirrors to see how hard they could frown so it got a few doubts going but then some AMAZING dancers blew our minds! \n\nTwo girls in particular stuck with us for a while and gave us ALL lap dances and did some really crazy tricks on the chairs. $7 lap dances?? sign us up!!! We all agreed, who needs Christie's $20 dances when we can get gorgeous ladies and great music here! \n\nBTW-The music was just FABULOUS! Lots of variety (lil rap not much, lots of rock like Metallica, lil punk) so everyone in our group was rocking out hardcore-in more ways then one ;)\n \nGuys, girls, lesbians (we saw a few)-no matter-The Candy Store will take care of you all :D \n\nGo get your jelly watch on!!!",1
Visited this club while on a trip to AZ for a Niners game; from LA. Not a very diverse or diversity friendly club my boyfriend and I and another couple (who all happen to be African American) we followed around by the security and the $100 bill we paid for drinks and tips with was passed around several times to validate it's validity. \n\nA few dancers did an excellent job with pole dancing and tricks but the music wasn't really good (not that we needed to hear rap or hip hop) mostly old rock music and no name house music. I would not recommend.,0
"That might be the last time I use the YELP search to try and satisfy my sweet tooth... No ring pops or bottle caps here folks!!! But since I was already there I decided to stop in and much to my surprise there was a solid vending machine next to the restrooms.. The $5 cover seemed a little steep just to peruse the vending machine selection... The young ladies working  the establishment seemed to be enjoying the surroundings.. A dimly lit ambiance in which to enjoy a \""""Big Hunk.\"""" Music bumping, fists pumping, and scantily clad women swinging around the red vines flashing their skittles around freely for the taking. Decided to leave a short time afterwards, before I was tempted to get a Milky Way. Top notch establishment, will visit again! Probably going to need another dentist visit after satisfying that sweet tooth.",1

"Initially it seemed like Desert Gardens was going to do a wonderful job on the big re-landscape project in our backyard.  At $27,000+ we expected a lot and Jenny led me to believe that she would be there supervising.  That was not the case.  The installers were nice enough but barely spoke English.  They said that Jenny never comes to the jobs.  The planting a were fine except for two $300 plants that were planted in the wrong place and got burned.   They would not replace them.\n\nJenny's brother was supposed to have done work on our barbeque island but instead it was delegated to  the plant installer who doesn't speak english.  The worst offense was that when they modified our Canterra stone counter, they moved a burner over about 12\"""" farther away from the barbeque.  We thought it had been done properly, but  when we tried to turn on the grill we heard a very loud hissing.  We didn't try to light the grill, but if we  had the would have been a very big explosion because they had neither capped the gas line to the burner, nor connected it to the burner.  They just left the cut line wide open.  If we had tried to light the grill, the volume of gas pouring into the interior of the island (that was supposed to be connected to the burner) would have created a huge explosion.  We had to have a barbeque technician out to do the repair so we have all of this documented.\n\nSince we had our barbeque grill island modified, they had to replace part of the counter top.  It was supposed to have been done by Jenny's brother but instead was done by the plant installers who did a terrible job.  The Canterra stone top was very uneven and they left thinset all over everything including the barbeque grill which should have been removed or at least masked off for the counter installation.  The thin set won't wash off the existing tile and they chipped large pieces off the backsplash and just filled it with large holes with thinset instead of replacing the damaged tiles.\n\nJenny wouldn't return texts, and when her brother came out to see what needed to be done to complete the job, he was argumentative, telling me that the plants got scorched because they were planted too late in the season.  Since they were Yuccas, the plant won't ever replace those burned leaves (they were burned all the way up to five feet high on the plant), so the plant will forever looked wilted and scorched.\n\nOh, and the irrigation was connected to a house water line the was 1/2\"""" not the to the water supply line from the street with requisite 3/4\"""" minimum you need to get proper water pressure.  Consequently the heads don't always all pop up, and they were also set so deep that when the ones that do pop up spray, they are below the level of the grass.\n\nTo summarize, after leading me to believe that Jenny would supervise the installation Desert Gardens sent a bunch of unsupervised workers to do the job who didn't speak English.  I believe that over the three week course of installation Jenny showed up maybe two or possibly three times. No one addressed the problems.  No one followed through.  If they had been hands on and had been around to supervise, I believe that the job would have gone better.  They made a lot of mistakes and did some sloppy work.  The plantings turned out well for the most part not withstanding some difficulties where they would not be accountable for their mistakes.  The hard scape work was terrible and I would say, all in all, the fact that they did the job without supervision or follow through created a lot of problems.  I would NOT use them again.",0
"This place seems like they gave up on watering all their plants - and not adding any new ones - a year ago...reminiscent of the final days of a going-out-of-business sale. \n\nThe slim selection of mostly desert plants looked mostly half-dead, even the cacti. There was a small selection of citrus trees (priced in the $100's) that were skinny as a pencil and had dried, shrunken fruit (lemons or limes so black you couldn't tell exactly what they were) falling off. In the green houses were more less-than-stellar looking plants.\n\nThere was a good sample of Mexican pottery, recycled steel landscape ornaments, and painted steel wall ornaments. Much of it was enjoyable to look at, but the prices were much more than I wanted to pay. \n\nOnly reason I didn't give this one star is that the young attendant was courteous and friendly.\n\nI had bought a $100 LivingSocial Coupon for $40.50 (with promotion), but after checking out the selection, decided to head home and get my money back. I went to Home Depot the next day and got five healthy plants for under $40 - which probably wouldn't have bought one similar type plant at Desert Gardens.\n\nUnless you are on the hunt for some particular rare cactus to fill your collection, save your money and time and go to Home Depot or even Wal-Mart!",0
"We have bought almost all our plants here for the last many years.We loved this nursery. Last October we lost a big tree to a windstorm and Desert Gardens Nursery helped us choose a new one. Planted by the nursery, the cost was over $800 with a one-year guarantee. It threw all its leaves in early June and we tried calling the nursery for advice. We called daily for a week and left information and a return phone number. Two weeks later, we have still not received a call. Sadly we are finished with Desert Gardens Nursery.",0
"This Subway is the absolute worst! The staff of this place is so strange. They have the weirdest people working at this location. They are so creepy that I will never go back, This Subway is close to my house and I go out of my way several miles to go to another location. They all seem annoyed when you come into the store, half of them are usually in front of the store smoking. When they make your food, they sloppily throw it together, this place sucks! Do yourself a favor, go to another location. I have tried to contact the owners to tell them how uncomfortable the staff makes people feel but can't seem to find a phone number.",0
"Completely remodeled inside in the last few weeks. Still has the odd way that you have to line up to order, and the same staff. It just looks newer/cleaner.\n\nAnd its still just Subway.",0
"My roommate and I have managed to stay away from this location for about a year or so, actually driving out of our way to another location if we want to eat Subway. Unfortunately, my roommate gave in to convenience and brought home subs from this one. Even before anything was unwrapped, I just knew it was going to be awful, and I was right.\n\nI'm sorry, but these people have either never been trained on how to make subs, or they've been instructed by the owners to be as skimpy as possible with the toppings. The lettuce was lightly sprinkled on, as if you might add a dash of oregano. At first I thought it had been forgotten! Couldn't detect any crunch whatsoever. I had to open it to find out if there was any on there. There were maybe eight pieces of black olives on the entire footlong sandwich! Even the tomatoes were skimped on by a couple pieces (compared to EVERY OTHER SUBWAY I'VE EVER BEEN TO). So really, our sandwiches were  practically just lumps of wadded up meat and cheese, slathered with a little mayo on bread. This is NOT good to me at all, and not what I want or expect from Subway. We shouldn't have to pay for this garbage! \n\nSo why am I SO incredibly angry right now? James is an a**-h*le and was incredibly rude to my roommate on the phone when he politely called to complain and get the situation rectified. He downright refused to allow him to speak to a manager (or have the manager call him later) and only offered to replace half of my pathetically-made footlong. What about my son's 6\""""? The half of my footlong that I did eat? (I was going to bring the other half so they can see how badly it was made.) We were hungry. Are we really expected to stop eating (while very hungry), jump in the car and hurry over there during rush-hour? No, that's not good customer service. We weren't looking for anything extra either, even though it's a pain to drive back to a restaurant because of something they did wrong. We just wanted what we paid for. \n\nWhy are all the other Subways we've been to consistently good and this one consistently sucks? Not the first bad experience with James either (all-around bad attitude) but certainly the last time we spend a dime at this franchise.\n\nWe will be talking to corporate about this.",0

"Great place to go for an oil change or other services. Friendly staff that even ordered in a part the car needed and had it there in ten minutes. Inside there is tv, coffee, tea, bottled water, and popcorn. The wait went by fast and everything was at a great price.",1
"I spent $67 at the Valvoline on Cave Creek Road yesterday and I walked about completely frustrated and upset. \n\nI've been to this location a few times for a quick oil change or free top-off, and every time it has been a positive experience...until yesterday. \n\nI went into this location yesterday around 4:00. There was one free bay out of the three, and one woman and her 2 kids in the waiting room waiting for their car to be finished. I walked in, and one of the associates came in twice to talk to the woman, not once acknowledging me or asking if I had been helped. This happened a total of four times. Once the woman's car was finished, they came in, walked her out to her vehicle, and by then all bays were empty. There were about 5 employees in the bay areas and not one of them came into the waiting room to see if I had been helped. I was the only customer there. I received a phone call and stepped outside and ended up having to leave for a bit. \n\nI called from home right after that to see what time they closed and if they were currently busy. They didn't close for about two hours but when I said I was going to come in for an oil change the guy on the other line sounded frustrated with a tone of \""""I guess we can get you in...\"""", as if it was a huge inconvenience. \n\nTurns out it would be this guy that I would end up talking to once I brought my car in. Drove it up onto the bay and they began doing the point inspection. The manager (I was told by the disgruntled employee doing the computer work that he was the manager) went to lift my hood and I hear him say something about my windshield wipers needing replaced. I just bought these windshield wipers 2 months ago, and knew for a fact they were not in bad shape. \n\nThe employee looks at me and says, \""""my manager says your windshield wipers are shot and you need new ones.\"""" I told him I just bought new ones, he looks at them himself and goes, \""""uh, yeah, you definitely don't need new ones...I'm a terrible salesman.\""""\n\nThen they proceed to tell me I have tail/brake lights that are out. I said I will get them fixed later to avoid more charges. Later on when I went home, a friend and I checked all of my lights, blinkers, etc. and they all work PERFECTLY FINE. \n\nI then also made the mistake of actually paying $25 for a tire rotation. There are plenty of other places that will do it for free with a standard oil change. I knew it needed to be done but I regret not waiting to get it for free somewhere else or having a friend do it. Especially after I was completely ripped off here. I have a bad feeling that my tire rotation wasn't even completed. \n\nOnce they come into the waiting room and tell me my car is all ready, charge me and lead me out the door, I see an employee checking my tires with a curious look on his face. Before I get in my car he tells me to hold on a second. He then goes to the other employees and they start whispering about something and I ask if everything is okay. He then goes \""""when you start to drive, can you let me know if it feels funny? Like something is grinding on the front driver tire?\""""\n\nI was absolutely furious at this point. It felt fine, and I told him that, but I will be having someone else look at it to see if there are any issues with my tires, and if there are I will surely be connecting the problem to this location. This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a service shop. I was lied to multiple times about my lights and windshield wipers, and I feel like I was completely ripped off.",0
First time here and I couldn't be happier. Great recommendations without being pushy about sales. Quick in and out service and super friendly guys. A+ service and experience!,1
"Only gave them a star because there is no option for \""""0\"""" or negative stars! I have been going here for about a yr but this last time i had the WORST \""""oil change\"""" experience OF MY LIFE! I will NEVER be back and would advise everyone to reconsider before trusting them with your vehicle!\n\n I recently took my vehicle in for an oil change, and they talked me into doing a 3 point fuel injection cleaning saying that it would help my car run better and give me better gas mileage. I agreed to this service thinking it would help my car, but after they were finished they said they were only able to do part of the service because one of the parts had mesh over it. (So they didn't even do the full 3 point service) \n\nMy car was running perfectly fine and had not given me ANY problems before this service. However, before I even left the parking lot my car was shaking when my foot was on the brake and the check engine light was flashing and beeping. I had to go pick my son up as I could not leave him at school and then immediately proceeded to go back and ask them what they did and if they could fix it... by this time the car's heat gage was beginning to rise. \n\nThey spent about 5 minutes trying to see what was wrong and then told me that they couldn't figure out the issue. They said I should take it next door to Big O tires and if they did something wrong then they would pay for it because they \""""stand behind their service 100%.\"""" \n\nBig O tires took and entire day to run a diagnostics on it and then called to tell me it was a blown head gasket and a misfire in Cylinder 4 and that although it may have been caused by the work they did there's no way to prove it.  I then got a call from Valvoline to let me know that they would not be paying for ANY of my repairs (which total $1,800.00!!!!) because there's no proof they messed up. So what was originally supposed to be a $40 oil change actually ended up costing me over $2,000.00 when you add in the price of the rental car I had to get, the cost of the service and the cost of the repairs... And they never once even offered to refund the money for the botched service they performed.\n\n I would advise everyone to stay far away from this facility!!!!!",0
"Family friendly feel.  Met the owner there one day.  Received a card with his family on it one time.  Love the little messages they put on their marquee.  Pretty quick service.  They always offer drinks and goodies to my kids when I bring them with me.  My only issue is that they usually end up taking 5-15 minutes more than what they tell me.  I don't mind being told that it will take longer before I get started.  Better to tell me longer and then get it done sooner than the other way around.

"I have used this U-Haul Storage for nearly a year. If one was to ask me if this was a good place to store their property? I would have responded with an empathetic yes! That is, until two Saturdays ago and my dealings with the acting manager, Dave.\n\nNow, I'm typically a month behind on my storage fees. But I always pay up, late, but it gets done. Late money spends the exact same as timely money. I'm paying nearly $300 for a locked space I barely enter for a near year! A rate they actually raised on me halfway through my rental! \n\nI should have been grandfathered in rather than victimized by a rental hike 4-5 months into the rental but they knew I had no choice and had to pay the increased rate!\n\nA new employee said he couldn't help me because he did not have keys to the locks. He just walked away from us. We had to wait for Dave to finish with an elderly couple that walked in when we did. Dave could have easily helped us briefly or refused to help us (as he already had decided to refuse me help). Instead, we were forced to witness the most uncomfortable & unethical 10 minutes of our lives!\n\n U-Haul associates make financial commissions when they sell optional insurances. Of course, there are guidelines and a basic code of ethics  regarding the salesmanship of such optional services for obvious reasons. Reasons that were made clear this horrid day.\n\nThe optional insurance is optional. But when the elderly couple asked Dave why their total was much higher than expected, with a straight face, Dave informed them that it was higher because of the \""""mandatory\"""" insurance for the rental vehicle. He simply added it to their bill. He never asked them if they wanted it or explained to them their options!\n\nAfter a bunch of lies and double talk, Dave bullied the couple into paying for optional insurance that they may very well have never needed. They certainly made it clear that they had not wanted it but finally took it after Dave made it clear it wasn't an option. Dave got his extra money!\n\nWithout pulling me up on his computer screen he told me rudely that if he opened my unit, with such a high balance (nothing new for the past year) he would get fired. He had never seen such a high balance! He refused to allow me access. He ridiculed me and made me feel like I was the scum of the planet.\n\nAt least when I sold optional services, I sold them ethically and never bullied people into taking it against their wills. What a disgusting and greedy person. And he had to make a scene over me having a balance albeit one I've paid for nearly 12 consecutive months.\n\nEven when I demanded to make a payment towards my balance he refused to accept it unless it was paid in full.\n\nIf one is looking for a storage unit I would strenuously suggest looking elsewhere!",0

I mean be a DJ and control the sound too, it's not too hard.\n\nWell drinks are nice and cheap, but you get what you pay for. Crappy pours. Bartender needs to go back to school on how to do a decent pour. \n\nOnly thing that brings it to two stars is that you can gamble on dog races there. That was new and a little amusing.\n\nHappy hour is okay. They could step up their game if the bartenders would give you a real pour and not make excuses when a drink tastes like more water than it does alcohol or soda... you think to keep good PR you'd at least comp that drink of the customer is adamant on the drink sucking (unfortunately my friend didn't get that normal service).",0
"Cinco de Mayo, last minute decide to hang out with a couple friends but don't want to get too loco since we all had to work early the next day.  We figure Gallagher's would be a safe bet and it was centrally located to all of us.  Two of us get there first and walk into a practically empty bar.  I mean, I know we didn't want out of control, but it would have been nice to have SOME kind of background noise going on.  The annoying thing about all this was that even though it was dead the service was S..........L.......O.........W.............  When my friend and I walked up to the bar the bartender didn't acknowledge us and took about 5 minutes to pour a couple beers for the 3 people sitting around.  Once he finally did make his way over to us he wasn't friendly and took his time pouring our two beers as well.\n\nOnce we finally had drink in hand we made our way to the patio outside to try to escape the elderly gentleman who had started serenading me and also enjoy some of the springtime air.  Unfortunately it appears that if you sit outside you do not get to enjoy the privilege of a server so we had to venture back inside whenever we needed something.  Luckily for the sake of our evening we had a good time hanging out with each other but no thanks to this place at all.  It would have been practically the same experience if we had gone to a grocery store, purchased some beer there, and then sat in front of the store.  So you better believe that if that's the kind of scenario I'm looking for, I'm gonna save myself the money and do exactly that rather than paying bar markup prices.",0
"Great people watching, dive bar-esque. One time we were in, the karaoke DJ dedicated feel like making love. To his mother for Mother's Day. No joke. If you're cool with watching your bartender eat food and snack on fruit non stop behind the bar and don't care about unevenly padded barstools, this is your place!",0
Awesome place. I just moved to Arizona and use yelp to find everything and I am glad I found this place. It's my new spot!,1
"This is a neighbor hood bar that I only can see one coming to if one lives right by. There is nothing I consider redeeming by this place. They have beer, they have standard grub and standard everything else. Nothing to yelp about ;) It's almost as if they went out of their way to maintain anonymousy if it wasn't the gloom atmosphere with a hint of depression and melancholy. \n\nI don't thing that Gallaghers has a format that is desirable, at least not for me. I have other establishments to force my taxed monies upon.\n\nI had some great company, but I can't credit the establishment for that. I cannot see it in the stars that I will return, to this or another namesake establishment. \n\nThey do have trivia. If anyone is into that, but they won't deserve my mercy because of it. \n\n.. und das ist nach ein entt\u00e4uscht kritiker",0
"We went the evening of my little sister's 21st birthday to get shots to start the night out. She had never had alcohol and was excited to try her first shot. However, the waitress, Amy, was completely RUDE to us! After looking at my sister's ID, went to get a waiver for her to sign because her ID was, of course, still strait up and down. She laid it on the table and said in her snotty tone: \""""Be prepared, you're gonna be filling out A LOT of these tonight!\"""" The only other words she communicated to us were rude, as well. Of course, the rest of the night, we didn't sign one single waiver. We told Amy we just wanted the two shots and then we'd like the check, but she didn't come back for another twenty minutes after giving us the shots! WE had to flag her down to get her to finally come back to the table, and the place wasn't busy at all. My fianc\u00e9 and I had been to this Gallagher's many times before and loved it, but Amy ruined our experience and we won't be coming back.  \nWe came in smiling and she totally killed the mood.",0
"The food and the staff are well above average!  However, every time I've been here the regular crowd has been loud, profane, and very disruptive.",1
"After my car accident I was in so much pain that I needed someone that could help me fast. I was able to schedule my appointment the same day and after my first adjustment I started to feel so much better. Dr. Tom took his time and was able to help me. I was so impressed that my wife, 16 year old daughter and 15 year old son came to him on a regular basis. My kids are very active in sports and they alway use to complain about aching bone pain. NOT ANY MORE. Thanks Dr. Tom.",1
"I too found them on Rosie and have used them two times. First I have to say that the staff is very nice and the technician is a great guy. The first time I used them I was in a bind and my aircon was dead in July. The price was very steep for the job but I paid. The second time I had a furnace that was not working. I troubleshot the problem and the technician came out who agreed with me that the ignitor was bad. I was quoted that this part would cost $317. I was in shock since an ignitor is nothing more than a rod with wires that heats up for the furnace to ignite, no rocket science. I shopped around and found a new factory part from Carrier for less than $45. I installed the part and works just fine. \n\nI realize that price mark-up is how a lot of companies make their money but this is truly gross misconduct and really uncalled for. Now I want to be clear the staff is awesome and this is why I gave them 2 stars but in this economy and with a Rosie rating I am very disappointed.",0
"I initially found out about this company through SRP for their rebate program for an A/C tune up. They came out and actually did a pretty thorough inspection and then came the up sale time. I know they don't make a lot off these inspections. They said 2 of my refrigerant caps didn't have the little o-rings in them and needed to be replaced which i agreed. They 2 of them for $20 which they told me was the going rate. Now, granted perhaps I should've looked online first and what not but the guy assured me these were expensive for some reason. I looked online today and could get 2 shipped to me for $5. Not a good company to be overcharging by $15. \n\nI can't stand companies that try to make money off of nickel/dime items. I guess that's a pet peeve of mine. I will never be using these guys in the future and the only reason I used them to begin with is because they were referred by SRP. Stay away from this poorly run company!",0
"My AC broke @ 2am, following a monsoon storm passing through the Valley on 7-12-2012.  I went to the \""""Rosie on the House\"""" KTAR website.  The only listing for my area of town was Integrity.  I called them at 6:15am to schedule a repair.  I was quoted a service arrival of 3:30-7pm. I left work early and arrived home at 3:30, but no call or show by Integrity (my brother was at the house all day), so I know I didn't miss them.  At 6:25pm, when no service technician had yet arrived, I called Integrity and left a message that I was anxiously awaiting their arrival. Someone returned my call at 6:35, stating a technician was enroute 20 minutes before my message and should arrive within minutes.  Shelby arrived @ 7:10pm. I met him in the front yard and told him the problem.  He said it sounds like the fan motor had frozen.  Hi climbed onto the roof and inspected the unit. After six (6) minutes, he came down from the roof and told me it indeed was a frozen fan motor with ancillary damage to blades and coils. He said repair would be $500, but he recommended a complete unit replacement which he estimated to be about $6,000. I asked if the repairs could be completed TONITE to get the unit running. Shelby said \""""Yes.\""""  I authorized the repair. He removed the fan assembly, banged the motor with a wrench & then told me he couldn't proceed with the repair because he needed a new fan assembly from the manufacturer & he didn't know the brand of my unit & would have to research if they were even in business (23-year old unit, I since found out is a Heil, \""""Builders Model\"""" 3-ton gas-pack unit). He said If he proceeded with repairs tonite, he couldn't guarantee any work nor parts and it would be another $300-$400 for a return visit with the manufacturer parts. He recommended replacement.  So instead of spending $800-$900 in \""""no guarantee\"""" repairs, I scheduled a free estimate for 7-13 @ 3pm and Shelby charged me $69 for his late arrival, 6-minute diagnostic visit, cutting the fan motor wires and scheduling the estimate visit the following afternoon.  Ross arrived on time. He gave me a 15-minute talk, left me with two out-dated brochures (Trane & Lennox) and a verbal ballpark figure of $5,800-$6,000 for a Lennox or Trane, 3 ton, 14 SEER gas pack unit, while bad-mouthing the competition (I was upfront about seeking 4 other anonymous contractors' bids).  He never inspected the unit, the attic, the ducts, the registers, the intake, the thermostat, the roof -- nothing!  I asked for a written proposal and he said he would work on it while at home this weekend and he would email it to me by Sunday. The other contractors left written, concrete proposals. They inspected my home, attic, roof, broken unit, ducts, and registers BEFORE their written proposals. Booooooo! Two-thumbs DOWN!  I have since found out \""""Integrity\"""" purposefully sliced the wires of fan assembly unit, a move every other AC company has said was not necessary.  I had the unit repaired on 7-14 by Walker Heating & Cooling (602-446-3800) for $325 WITH a 1-yr warranty on parts & labor!",0
"RUDE, unprofessional salesperson!  I kicked him out of my home within 3 minutes of his arrival.  \n\nHave you ever tried to purchase a new air conditioner?  All companies want to meet you in your home and take an hour of your time to give you a quote.  With that in mind, I took a full day off work and scheduled 9 AC companies every hour on the hour to give me quotes.  I met all companies at the Maricopa Home and Garden Show last weekend and in person made appointment and told each company was told about my scheduling and that they may even run into each other.  They all said they understood and agreed, even Integrity (the business card given to me was for Ross Carlisle, \""""Comfort Consultant\"""").  \n\nOn appointment day Integrity was to arrive at 1:00pm.  He arrived at 1:33pm.  After opening the door he didn't say hello, he just said, \""""Someone's already here and cutting into my time.  I don't normally do this, but I can't wait all day.\""""  Despite his initial rudeness, I invited him in.  As I showed him where the AC unit was located outside, he continued his rudeness.  I reminded him that when I made the appointment they were told that I had other companies here the same day to give quotes.  He made other snarky remarks to which I asked, \""""Is this going to be a problem?\""""  He said, \""""No, but I've been waiting since outside for 30 minutes.\"""" I asked if he rang the doorbell.  He said, \""""no\"""" and said more remarks clearly indicating that he didn't want to earn my business.  I stopped him there and told him to leave.  I told him that if this is the way I was treated during the sales process (30 minutes late and rudeness). I can only imagine how bad their service would be. \n\nThe irony here is their name:  Integrity.  Based on my experience, they don't have any.",0
"When my family was living up in the valley, Integrity was our first and only choice when it came to installing, and up keeping our new AC. They provided quick and effective service, and had our new system installed in about a week. They were friendly overall, and showed us how to work, and upkeep our system. And by following that we never had to call for maintenance, and we stayed in the house for a little more than a year after having it installed. Integrity is quick, efficient, and friendly completely worth your time and money.",1
"Air conditioning units are problamatic to say the least, mine is no different. For once I can sit back and relax knowing Integrity Air conditioning was on the job. That's a rarity in the heating and cooling industry.  They are fully insured, licensed and not to mention, \""""Rosie certified\"""". You need look no further then their name to know what your going to get as far as work ethic and quality are concerned. Integrity will be first on my list in the future for any of my cooling and heating needs.",1
"Great customer service is hard to come by, and yesterday I encountered one of the best customer service experiences I have had in an automotive store. Most times, the guy behind counter is there \""""just for the job\"""" and \""""just trying to get my money\"""" but not this time.  My experience was professional courteous, and ultimately he was genuinely concerned for the value of the money I was spending.  You have a great asset in Vince Miller, managers like him are like a needle in a haystack.  \nThank you and I will continue to send my friends and family to see him.",1
"I have been taking my cars here for a while now and am always impressed with the service we get here.  Joey is amazing and always puts the customer first.  This team goes over and beyond.  If anything happens to go wrong it is fixed with no problems. I respect a place that has integrity, and this location certainly does!",1
"I've gone to these guys before and had good luck with them. Needed two tires and an alignment. The manager told me that they would do a free 'inspection.' Was a new guy I hadn't seen before and I'm wary when they do an 'inspection.'  Last time a tire place did an 'inspection'[ they told me I needed four new struts, when I didn't.\n\nHe told me I needed a new radiator, because this one was corroded and leaking and it would be 800 bucks. I was a little leery of this since I just drove it back from Vegas sat in traffic for two hours and had no problem with overheating. I took it home, ran the car with the a/c blasting at subzero temperatures while sitting in the heat for an hour. I inspected the radiator five times over that hour and found no evidence of corrosion, leaks, or overheating. This is a Toyota with 75k on it, and its been a damn solid car. So, watch it when they want to 'inspect' your car here. They WILL find something, probably parts they bought for a discount on overstock. Who knows, maybe they'll sell your own radiator back to you.",0
All they did was try to up sell me.,0
dont believe these guys. they are dishonest and liars. i book an appointment online for next day and call them to confirm my appointment. they told that my appointment is confirm and i can come to service center at 7st & unions hills. when i reached there after 10 miles drive that guy told that my appointment us not confirm and he don't want to argue. i told him that you only asked me to come on phone but he was behaving very rude. they are not known for customer relationship. i dont wanna give them even single star. plz dont believe on Firestone people.,0
"On November 30 I took me car in for an oil change. The technician drained the oil, put on a new oil filter but forgot to put the oil back in it.  The engine seized up on the way home.  I called Chuck the assistant manager.  He sent a tow truck to bring the car back to the store.  My car didn't arrive back until 8:00 pm that evening.  I called the next morning.  I talked to the Manager Joey.  He said there was oil in the car...They put the oil back in the car after the engine seized up, and they are denying liability.  The tow truck driver confirmed, when he came to get the car, that he could not see any oil on the dip stick. An Inspection revealed that there was metal particles in the oil.  When I talked to Chuck and asked him what he saw when they removed the rod to inspect the crankshaft.  He said a lot of scaring.  After battling with the claims department for 29 days they finally offered my $1000.  That doesn't cover the cost of repairs to my car and now i have a bill for a rental car for $945.  I will NEVER use Firestone for any services ever again.",0
"It has been 38 days now since I took my car into Firestone (see my review below).  I have a witness to the fact that they forgot to put oil in the car after an oil change and they are still not accepting liability.  Joey Huskey, the manager, lied to me and the assistant manager has been told not to talk to me because he knows they didn't put the oil back in.  I just don't understand how a company like this can do something so horrible.",0
"I'd give this place five stars except I consider it pricey and the limited weekend hours can inflate the bill a little.  Very pleasant staff who remembered my pet from one visit to the next.  Clean, clean, clean.  Deluxe accomodations and I like the touch of the little photo of my dog playing placed on my bill. \n\nAlso, they are very attentive to making sure your pet's shots are up-to-date.  So that gives confidence that only healthy animals are boarded - or at least it reduces the chance that your pet will come home with something they picked up while boarded.\n\nI have used off-and-on for two years now.  Sometimes they are booked solid and I have to go elsewhere, and I haven't found anywhere else that compares quality-wise.  I feel very guilty boarding my sweet Lab at all.  Going here reduces that feeling as much as possible.\n\nHighly recommended for your puppy dog.",1
"Their main goal is to upsell you on everything they possibly can... NOT CARE FOR YOUR PET!\n\nWe took our Golden Retriever for 3 1/2 days, when we picked him up we asked how he did... The man said 'next time you should really take advantage of the group play time'... that was it?? \n\nAs we are leaving we notice there is a 'resident cat'  wandering around with a major butt infection...\n\nMy main purpose in writing this is- our poor sweet dog came home with dog poop on the back of his coat (all crusted in) and it was not cleaned by the staff-- he either sat in another dogs poo or his own, but he was not cleaned up.  \n\nOur dog is and has been potty trained since we've had him.  The first night home from the \""""resort\"""" he had major diarrhea in our bathroom and it had blood in it- we then noticed he was doing the butt scoot...???  Seems there are some infections going around there... shady!!!\n\nWe will NEVER take our sweet animal there EVER again... They do not care for the animals properly, who knows if they even ever let him outside or gave him water for that matter. \n\nBEWARE!!!\n\nConsidering calling the Humane Society to have them checked out.",0
"We've boarded our three Labs several times at Boulder Falls Pet Resort, for several days at a time, while traveling.  At first, we had no complaints as all three of our canine kids appeared happy and in good health when we picked them up to go home; however, on the last occasion we would allow our dogs to board at Boulder Falls, a staff member played our male Labrador too hard and too long in the playground area - the young man even admitted \""""he might be a little sore since he play so hard\""""   Our male Labrador suffered a neck injury which required veterinarian care including cortisone shots and pain relief medication.  \n\nMy husband and I spoke with the front-desk staff, and they said and did nothing to alleviate our apprehension of ever boarding our dogs at this pet resort again.  In fact they appeared oblivious to the truth of what we tried to communicate with them.  They offered no apologies.  We were not looking for financial compensation -- just admission of what happened and the promise it would not happen again.\n\nNeedless to say, we have not been back to Boulder Falls Pet Resort, nor would we ever recommend it to dozens of our pet-loving, traveling friends.",0
"I am reviewing the \""""Day Spa\"""" part of Boulder Falls Pet Resort & Day Spa.  Altho, please note that I have used, and will continue to exclusively use, their Pet Resort for boarding and doggie day care when I need it.  \nI have a 1 year old Australian Shepherd and he is absolutely crazy.  He is a smart dog, but his kryptonite is other dogs; all his manners go out the window and he just barks and jumps and wants to play with his 4-legged friends.  I took him to Boulder Falls today to get him shaved down due to lots of shedding. This was the first time I had used a dog groomer.  I was pretty nervous that he was going to be out of control for the groomer and he would come back 1/2 shaved, or nicked, or have a cut somewhere, or his coat would be completely uneven.  He was none of the above.  He looked great!!!  I can not give Boulder Falls' Day Spa anything but 5-stars because I know my dog, and I know he's a handful, and I know that they did a wonderful job shaving him and blending his head!  And to top it off, he was outside playing ball with the groomer before I came and got him! Lastly, the price (compared to a big chain pet store you have all heard of) is very reasonable!",1
"We wanted to find a place where our dog could go to break up the week of being in the kennel for long periods of time while we work. We found boulder falls and are so happy we did, not to mention our Golden LOVES to go. They were very open to us checking out the facility and talking through our questions and concerns (we are first time dog owners so were nervous about leaving him). It only took a few visits for them to recognize us by name. It's $18 for a full day, which seems pretty comparable to other places nearby. We have never had any issues with him getting sick, fleas or into fights with other dogs. They keep track of their shots (you can see when you're due on the receipt, with a picture of your furry friend) so you can feel assured all dogs are up to date. Our dog gets pretty dirty and they have started to towel him down before he leaves, if he's really bad they've given him a quick hose down for free. I like that there are plenty of people playing in the yard so any potential fights seem to be prevented or broken up quickly,  which gave us piece of mind since our guy was a puppy and still learning the rules of the playground. They also put the dogs into groups so more passive temperaments are playing together, then more energetic together.\n\nI wish there were more pictures or updates of their day. It would be great to have longer hours as it's hard to get to work on time, but that's minor compared to great service and attention he receives and they've been very flexible when we need to drop off earlier than 8:30.",1
"As soon as you walk in the door here you know you came to the right place.  The staff is terrific and they greet your pet (two dogs in my case) like they've known them forever.\n\nWe have on dog who is a bit standoffish with strangers and he warmed up to the staff member who took him back almost immediately. Our other dog would happily follow the devil through the gates of hell so she's not an issue :-)\n\nWe left the dogs there for a week. When we left our dogs in kennels in the past they would immediately head for the door when we showed up. Not here, while we were paying the bill (reasonable) they were playing with the attendant.  They clearly had a good time and bonded with the staff.  It helps erase the guilt of leaving them in a kennel in the first place.\n\nThe dogs were clean, well fed and the staff even shared some stories about what they'd been up to.",1
"Went here for the first time yesterday and got the VIP pedicure. The chairs were so-so, but the pedicure itself was wonderful. They even stayed later to accommodate the large party. I'd go back. The wax and hot rock massage made me a believer. Super nice staff as well.",1
I brought my teenage daughters here for a mani pedi. The staff was friendly and the services were reasonably priced.,1
"Will not be coming back here, waste of time. The owner was very nice and welcoming but that didn't make up for the quality of service. Started with the deluxe pedicure for a decent price. The water was cold. When I go for a pedicure I mostly go for the massage, I usually pay for extra massage if needed. She was pretty much just putting lotion and the sea salt on my legs and feet. No massage or rubbing what so ever. I asked her if she could rub harder or more rough. She either didn't understand or did not want to because she just told me no and shook her head. Complete waste of time, I did not see a point since I can put lotion on my legs myself.. Also painted my toes poorly with excess polish on my skin. When it came to get my gels replaced I presented a design I just wanted something similar. He did well on the design yet painted very poorly missing the sides of my nails and the gel is not thick enough and bumpy. My nails can chip or break very easily. All in all I'm never going back there. I only came there because my usual place is closed Mondays. Tiffiany's Nails, they are great.",0
"Love this place!  I've been going here for a few years.  The staff is friendly, the prices are great and they do an excellent job.  I highly recommend the VIP pedicure.",1
"I kind of hate quick trip - only because my boyfriend loves it so darn much. He drags me there regularly.  No normal human being should ever need to go to the gas station as often as he does. That being said,  this gas station does not deserve a bad rating because my boyfriend is obsessed with them.  Truthfully, it is a nice gas station.  It's clean.  The service is always quick,  and the gas prices are usually reasonable compared to the competition.",1
cashiers dont know how to count.  if you like loosing money come here,0
"This is a good place to bring the little ones to see if they're interested. The instructors are gentle and helpful with all of the kids. They have an introductory special that gives the student a chance to try it out before committing. Apparently you can work all the way up to a black belt, as there are several older students who are doing just that. The classes are organized by age, so the students aren't paired up with someone much larger or smaller. When they're starting they mostly practice evasion techniques and some judo grappling, and only practice sparring with other students as they get older. When my daughter first started she was really hesitant, but an instructor took her by the hand and helped her feel comfortable. Now she always has a smile when she's in class.",1
"I was surprised at how good the food was at this tiny place. I normally avoid the \""""hole-in-the-wall\"""" type places, but I decided to give this one a try and SO happy I did. The food was well priced and not too greasy. The ingredients taste fresh and it has that family owned feeling.",1
Best hole in the wall Mexican food in the valley! And they have a cute little salsa bar too. Love it!,1
"Not too shabby... Of course the interior isn't much to be desired, but I have always learned that some of the best Mexican places are tiny little run down shacks. \n\nWe hit this place up on a Groupon purchase and was pleasantly surprised by the delicious plates that arrived. The fresh chips and salsa were great, service was pleasant and quick, as our overall experience was above average. I had the tamale/enchilada plate and my husband had the two chicken tacos plate. Both were pretty good and the price was cheap (even if we weren't using our $1 for $10 Groupon).\n\nThanks for the experience Mi Pueblo Mexican! We enjoyed!",1
Talk about a hole in the wall place!!! Awesome food at a great price and the staff was friendly and pleasant. \n\nWe did breakfast burro's Egg & bacon and my wife Steak fajita burro (all was very tasty)\n\nIf you are looking for a quick place to get some good Mexican food this is the place!,1
"Oh so good!  I get take out from these guys every week or so and have never been disappointed.  I'm a creature of habit and am addicted to their chicken burrito.  My husband loves their twin chimis.  It's a little hole in the wall restaurant with hardly any seating, but they consistently deliver great food which is not something every restaurant can claim.",1
"We went to this place this evening to redeem a yelp \""""$10 for $5\"""" deal. I'm not sure how they manage to keep a stellar rating. It was good food, but the price was high and the portions were tiny. The quesadilla we ordered was the worst offender, as it was made from a taco-sized tortilla. I have never seen such a tiny quesadilla in my life. If it was a kid's meal I may have understood, but it was $4.99! The chimichanga was pathetic, too. I think the guy working there must have given us a kid's chimi on accident, because i can't imagine anyone spending money at this place on a regular basis for a chimi so small. It was literally 2\"""" wide by 6\"""" long by 1\"""" tall. That's for a $6.99 chimi. Macayo's charges a few bucks more for a chimi that's more than twice the size. I guess the only decent thing was the free chips and salsa, although the chips had enough salt on them to decrease my cardiac health by about 50%. I'm not sure why anybody salts anything anymore, with all the negative medical news on excessive salt consumption, but that's another problem altogether. As for this place: I tried it...probably won't be back. Caramba is a much better restaurant for a much better price.",0
"I think I want to eat here every day this week. I came in on a slow Sunday night, and wanted to go back on Monday (but I finished my leftovers instead), then Tuesday, and I actually think I might go back tonight to try the Green Chili Chicken Enchilada. I got the Chicken Fajitas plate, and my husband got the tamale and taco combo.  Everything was fresh, not too greasy, and extremely delicious. This is my new quick and easy Mexican food restaurant. Yay!",1
"My friend and I went to see about the groupon I asked the cashier if I could buy 2, he asked to see my phone i handed it over thinking he was just reading the fine print and he hit buy and confirm. I later called to speak to a manager about this unauthorized charge and was told to call some other time the Metro Center location was not  anymore help. I'am astounded the clerk had the audacity to spend my money without my consent.",0
Great food.,1
"I walked into this hole in the wall in a shopping center hoping to find some authentic Mexican food. As I walked in, there was a woman washing tables. I placed my order with a man on the phone clearly having a personal conversation but he paused long enough to take my order. After I ordered, the woman who was washing tables strolled into the back where you can see them prepare the food. She wiped her hands on her dirty apron and reached for a tortilla with BARE unwashed hands I almost walked out right there but was so shocked I just watched in disbelief!! She proceded to slap some ingredients on it from containers rolled it up sprinkled some cheese; still no gloves. The best part; she put it in a styrofoam container and then PUT it in the microwave!! Mouth dropped to the floor after just paying $8.14. I walked out and threw in the trash, so disgusted!",0
"I ordered a shrimp burro - they grilled the shrimp, filled it with lots of stuff, and smothered it with a delicious sour-cream type of sauce.\nThe all-you-can-eat chips and salsa are good.  No problem with doing your own refilling, that way you don't waste.  We loved mixing their hot and mild salsa together, and just having a container of each.\n(we ate in, but I see that they do a pretty good \""""take-out\"""" business as well)  They're close to a water store, so if you need to refill your 5-gallon bottles...",1
"This place is a hidden gem. I used to work near the other location (near Metro Center) and ate there all the time. I was delighted to find another location closer to where I'm working now. Great place for lunch or take-away after work. The chips and salsa are possibly the best anywhere. The salsa is clearly fresh-made and it ROCKS. \n\nI swear they don't make anything until you order it. My favorite is the fajita burrito with chicken. The veggies are fresh-grilled and always have just the right texture, and the chicken is perfectly prepared as well. I have NEVER seen them put a styrofoam container in the microwave (as one poster stated) and can't imagine why they would (or would need to). \n\nThis is not a fancy place. The atmosphere is just adequate. Go to Chili's for that. If it's really good food you're after, you won't be disappointed!",1
A nice little place to grab a quick bit to eat. They have a average selection for the menu and the food is pretty tasty.,1
"I think I can finally call off the hunt for the delish type of Mexican food I miss from home in Texas.  Simple menu, good prices and freshly made food that left us wanting more.  \n\nOur party of three ordered the beef chimi, the cheese enchiladas (no sauce) and the green chicken enchiladas.  At first we'd planned to order our dinner to go - that is until we laid our eyes on the salsa.  So many places just totally lack a good salsa, but this one looked bright and fresh.  It was delicious!  Vibrant and with a little kick, the mild salsa hit the spot.  And the self serve chips were perfect for our table.\n\nThe food arrived just in time as we finished up our salsa and chips, and it couldn't have looked more inviting!  We tucked in right away.  There was no conversation - this food was too good for talking!  \n\nThe place is cozy with only a few tables, but was still comfortable.  Plenty of folks came in and out for take out orders.  Each and every customer was greeted by a friendly guy, and the nifty credit card system even allowed for an emailed receipt instead of printing one out.  Great place that I will absolutely be trying again and again.",1
"Had a burrito, but it wasn't very good.  The first half of it tasted like all beans.  The 2nd half was better, but still left a lot to be desired.  I was really hoping I'd like this place because it's so close, but I don't think I'll be back.\n\nWhen I went, the place was packed full, but I was still served quickly.  Friendly staff.",0
Got chicken chimi ... so good.. so much food. Have come here multiple times . Everything is always great.  Family owned and operated.  Great people.,1
This is by far the worst Circle K on the face of the planet all of their debit card readers on the gas pumps are out 20 people\nin line for gas!!  I will never Shop here  again,0
"Was in the area and stopped in for. Cousin's used to be a regular lunch stop for me, but the three that I usually went to have closed over the last few years.\n\nThis one is barely acceptable. The place is dirty and the workers are apathetic. Either the whole chain has changed, or this place is below standards. I think that my sandwich had the absolute minimum of ingredients it could've. \n\nI'm not coming back.",0
"I'm not really one to write a review on a dinky little sandwich shop in a strip mall, but I have had so many negative experiences at this place that I felt I needed to share them.  The people that work here have been beyond rude every time I have visited this Cousin's Subs.  The first time I came in I used a coupon, which seemed to piss the old guy working the counter off.  I asked to substitute one ingredient for another and was rudely told \""""No Substitutions!\""""  The workers are always impatient with the customers and always act as if I'm inconveniencing them by being in their store and giving them business.  And to top all off, their sandwiches aren't all that good!  They skimp on all of the ingredients and try to charge you extra when you ask for more.\n\nAvoid this place and just go to Subway.  You'll get a better sandwich without the attitude.",0
"kid friendly, owner operated, really nice people to deal with. when I want sandwiches on a hot summers evening this is where I go. fresh breads, fresh meat, fresh veggies, and the people are really patient with my children",1
I bought some bar stools from them... It took a long time to get them because of the fabric... now that we have them they look great,1
"Called to find a chair I really liked on their website, but the person couldn't find it on her \""""price sheet\"""" -- so she said that probably meant it was discontinued. Price sheet? Really? In 2014?\n\nFor the life of me I can't understand why this company is still around without offering ANY prices on their website. Very frustrating shopping experience. I have no desire to visit their store.",0
"In general I prefer credit unions to banks.  I've moved all my money out of banks into credit unions.  \nThis credit union is the exception.  In short, they stole $10 from me.\nThe long story is, last year I set up a checking account for our family trust.  In the process I was forced to create 2 savings accounts with token amounts of $5 each.  I was told this was a requirement of credit unions.  What I wasn't told was that come this year and the $5 was still there, they confiscated it from both accounts because of \""""lack of activity in the account\"""". Even though I had nearly 6 figures in the checking account.\nI was not told this when I set this up and I feel I have been robbed!\nBEWARE OF THIS PLACE.",0
"Upon moving to Arizona I had been using Frist Credit Union to do my banking because they offer shared banking with my credit union in Nebraska.  The process was easy to just go in and deposit money into my Nebraska account.  After awhile I decided I should open an account here in Arizona.  I went in and opened my account and everything was good for a short time.  I would bring in my checks and be able to have my funds available right away.  One Friday I brought my paycheck in and they said they had to verify my employment in order to put the check in my account.  Weird since they did that the first day I opened my account and weird since they had already cashed a couple of my paychecks.  Also, the company I work for is a huge company and has been in business since 1974.  So they called my work, verified my employment, deposited the check and the funds were available.  Next payday I go in and the same thing happens, they say they have to verify my employment...I am a little over it at this point.  They call and do their thing and deposit the check.  Next payday, same thing.  At this point I am getting upset because there is no reason to keep having to verify my employment.  I have worked there for 7 years!  I ask about this and tell them I am getting upset by this and the acted as though they really didn't care.  I needed my money so she calls, verifys my employment and comes back tells me there will  be a 10 day hold on my check. Seriously???  They have been cashing my checks since day 1 with no problems.  I put up a fuss and she tells me she will cut it down to a 4 day hold.  What???  So she can just make her own rules???  I told her to forget it and deposit it in my shared account in Nebraska.  She got really rude with me and told me they would put a hold on it also.  I looked her in the eye and told her to do it and I assured her they would never put a hold on any deposit in my account.    She deposited the money and guess what??? The money was immediatly available.  I told her to close my account because I was so pissed off.  She then told me I would be charged $35 to close it!!!  What???  She said it was stated in the paperwork I got when I opened my account... I looked through it all and I have nothing that states this.  To sum this up, DO NOT GIVE THIS CREDIT UNION YOUR MONEY!  They seem to have forgotten that they need our money, we don't need them.  There are a lot of  banks out there that are happy to have your money.",0
"I encourage active duty military and families of active duty military to think twice before doing business with first credit union. We move around often and sometimes even important documents can get misplaced. We used our account as savings while my husband was deployed last year and we have since moved out of state.  Unfortunately,  I do not have access to my account number.  Even though I have called with all of my information,  Even standing in a shared branch location with my social and id,  I cannot access any of our savings.  Sadly,  this really puts a damper on our Christmas shopping for our 2 children while my husband is home to enjoy with us! I'm thankful that we're living at camp Pendleton, ca and Phoenix is only an 8 hour drive.  The thought of having to travel to Phoenix to deal with this business and inconvenience our family during the holidays/my husband's only leave is despicable.  While I was at the shared branch location in Oceanside, the teller told me first credit union has no reason to withhold my account number.  I couldn't imagine being stationed any further and having to visit Phoenix just to withdraw money.  We will be visiting shortly and closing our account!",0
The staff is nice.  It's pretty clean.  They use little plastic disposables in the soaking tubs which is nice.  I'm a foot doc so I'm always watching how they do stuff.  It's super busy on the weekends but you can still be in and out in an hour.  It's a vietnemese place but English is well-spoken.  I'll go again.,1
"This place is right near my home where I just moved in, so I went there.  Very conveniently located at Tatum and Shea, behind Walgreen's, with good parking right in front.  The mani/pedis are $31-33 (I forget exactly).\n\nLuckily, the very first time I got Sue, who is fabulous.  I've been back to her twice already.  Sue does a great job on both mani and pedi, and she's wonderful at massage... takes her time, is very friendly and sweet, and speaks good English.  After a horrible move, I really needed that foot and leg massage.\n\nI also like the drying area at the front.  Everything is well set up, and the massage chairs are probably the best I've ever seen, and they use disposable trays in the basins.  Very nice decor, nice music and TV on news muted so you can see what's going on in the outside world.  They also have hooks so you purse doesn't have to be parked on the floor.\n\nOh and while I was at the front, a lady came in \""""demanding\"""" Sue and another woman was champing at the bit to get in my mani chair before I was even done.  This speaks highly for how good Sue is.  \n\nThis is my place for keeps!",1
"You'll see more Hermes bags, flashy Rolexes, and giant glittering diamonds here on a Saturday afternoon than you may see in an entire weekend at the Chateau Marmont. Don't let the flashing jewels fool you: this place is just another run-of-the-mill Vietnamese salon, with young girls gossiping away in another language, lone hovering overseeing male figure (i.e., \""""the pimp\""""), dirty instruments, and all. \n\nI came in with moderately grown out nails and one broken short nail, and wanted them all cut down to match the stumpy one. The answer I got? \""""Long nail pretty.\"""" No, really, I want them shorter. \""""Long nail pretty!\"""" and so I got 9 long, ghetto-square nails and one short rounded nail. Shock of shocks, two of the long square ones chipped within 24 hours. \n\nEven though this salon offers an array of 2-week gel polishes (Gelish and CNS Shellac), I doubt I'll be back. What's the point of paying $12+tip for a mani if you have to redo it yourself the following night?",0
"If you think making an appointment will prevent you from waiting - think again!  This salon is located near my house so I have tried it many times - each time hoping for a better experience.  Unless you are the first one in the door in the morning, plan on waiting.  If you have an appointment, you may even wait longer.  What is frustrating, is they will always tell you that will be a \""""few minutes\"""" even if the wait is really 40minutes.  The last time I was there,  I had an appointment at 1:00 and wasn't seen until 1:40pm!  When I asked how much longer, the male owner, kept saying, \""""few minutes.\""""  When I gave him feedback on how it would be really nice if they could be more accurate with how late they are running so people could run to walgreens or come back, he said, \""""If you don't like it - go someplace else- we have plenty of business!\""""  Since I tip so well, I was shocked at how I was treated.   The fact that my gel polish would ALWAYS come off after only 1 week and the pedicures weren't that great made me wonder why I was even trying to make this nicely located nail salon work for me.  I will never go back!",0
"My mom and I met at the salon. We didn't have a lot of time so I asked when we came in if there was any wait for two pedicures. They said no wait and sat us down immediately. Someone started working on my mom right away, but started her pedicure out by telling her they did not like the color she chose for her nails.  I thought this was odd but figured at least she was honest. 20 minutes later no one had come over to start my pedicure. I asked if I could soak my feet and they initially said no, only said yes after I asked why... they didn't want my feet soaking for too long. hmmm.  Then they told me someone would be over in 3 minutes. 15 minutes later finally someone came over to me but by that time it was too late. I told her I had to be home in a half an hour and she said that the pedicures only should last 30 minutes anyway.  I ultimately did not get the pedicure. \n\nThe salon also smelled a lot stronger than most of polish/remover etc. It was a little uncomfortable. \n\nEven though it is the closest place to my house I won't be going back.",0
"Seriously terrible work. I have never reviewed a place before but feel so strongly that people shouldn't waste their money here. The staff is rude and the nail I went in to have repaired looks absolutely terrible. Thought since they were closer than my normal nail place I would just go there since I just needed one repair, never again!! The one nail looks so horrible! Don't waste your time or money!",0
"Terrible pedicure and terrible gel nails. Not a good color selection and they don't put the polish up to your cuticles so both only lasted barely a week. On top of it lady told me only to bring tip in cash, shouldn't even tipped her at that point.",0
"Getting a pedicure here was awesome!  I was in Phoenix for a wedding and stopped by here for a pedicure.  I was seated in a chair immediately and got the one of the pedi packages that came with the callous remover, scrub and hot stone rocks.  The lady who did my nails was friendly and did a great job.  \n\nThis is a good place to get your nails done and they give you a discount if you pay in cash instead of card.",1
"It was a great pedicure however, she took the nippers (I was a licensed nail tech back in the 90's) and she dug into the side of my nail. It \""""woke me up\"""" real quick.  I know she was trying to really get all the cuticle however, we were always taught that you don't dig. I turned and watched her and she was just trying to make sure I had a clean nail bed.  Everything else went great.  She did the most beautiful flower.  I went home and took a nap.  I woke up and got up and felt the toe that was \""""jabbed\"""" throb.  I put iodine on it. I took a hot shower to open up the area and put more iodine on it.  I went out for the evening and that toe was throbbing.  I'm going to put a antibiotic cream on it. I have no doubt it will be ok in a few days with extra care.",0
"Everytime I attempt to go in here to get my nails done they are unable to do them. I strongly suggest you make an appointment if you want to get your nails done here, because walk-in appointments seem to be out of the question.",0
I got the worst gel manicure here last week. The lady was giving me attitude about my choice of colors. The gel on my thumb was all lumpy when I left. 5 days later the gel is peeling off and my nails are breaking. I won't be coming back here again.,0

There's a dog theme lobby for checking in.  \""""Elli\"""" gets her own room with her own bed, blanket and toys.  Additional walks and play times are available as add-on services.  \n\n7am check-in means we can get an early start heading out of town.  When we pick her up, there is a report card telling us how well (or not so well) she did with playing, eating and pooping.  An extra plus is that we can schedule an exit bath or a full-on grooming session (also extra fees for these) on check-out day so that Elli is sweet smelling when we get her home again.",1
"I take my little pooch to the Petsmart Hotel here when we absolutely have to board him. He seems to love it! He always enters and leaves lookig pretty happy! The rooms are big enough and you can see into the boarding room and I liked that so that I could see that is clean and roomy enough for him! They offer so many options for them while they are staying that it is a lot like camp! Even though we try to take him with us as much as possible, this is the place I take him when we are away!\n\nI have to only give it four starts though because I agree one one writer...not much of a selection of items!",1
"PetSmart is the worst place to take your dog.\n\nTheir petshotel is disgusting..they leave your do in a steel kennel all by themselves and don't care to pay attention to your pup. One time they gave a dog the wrong medicine and had to pay thousands at the vet to get its stomach pumped. Do you really trust your dogs with these employees? They pay them crap wages and it shows in their service. They overcharge for your stay as most other private places will take better care of your dog for much cheaper - really all youre paying for is the name, and having a corporation behind it. Doggie day care is horrible too, dogs have been in there with fleas and they don't care to check them before they toss your dog in their with some random stranger's mangly mutt.\n\nThe dog grooming is even worse. I have heard many screams from upset pooches coming from the salon. Most of the groomers don't care about taking good care of your dog either, they just want to make money. And they will make money off your stupidity with their \""""Top Dog Care Package\"""" which is $16 for a \""""oatmeal/hypoallergenic (*cough* bullshit)\"""" shampoo and coniditioner, and a lame attempt at brushing your dogs teeth (do it yourself it's waste of money to get it done here).  Private salons and even vets offer their services at much cheaper prices and we all know that in this tough economy it's very important to save bucks wherever and whenever you can. Even worse than their overpriced grooms, they will call you every 8 WEEKS TO BOTHER YOU to bring your dog in. How annoying! I'll bring my dog in when I want to - harassing me over the phone will not get me to come in.  \n\nTheir products are way overpriced - you can get many similar items at Ryans Pet Supply (14th and McDowell) for much cheaper.  Half the time they're out of something and can't even offer to tell you when they will be getting it, or direct you to something similar. I have seen dogs pee on the endcaps of shelves and employeees just stand around ignoring it.\n\nTheir Banfield vet is a joke. They wanted to charge me $180 to treat my cats ear infection. They are extremely overpriced and it's not personal whatsoever. They don't give a shit about your dog either.\n\nBottom line - go somewhere private. They will treat your dog a hundred times better and with more professional care.",0
"I like this PetSmart location. It's always full of people and seems to do well in business. So it can't be that bad, right?\n\nThe new-ish Pets Hotel is a plus. I don't use it because it's really pricey, but I like having the option to. The animals here seem to be doing just dandy, and with open arms they allow me to bring in my large Golden Retriever, Lilly. :) I don't have any qualms with this place.",1
"Don't use the grooming service.\n\nThey cut my dog's nipple which led to infection. I told them about their mistake, and they denied it. \n\nThey rolled their eyes at me and made me explain over and over again. \n\nRude staff. Inhumane servants. Terrible experience for my dog.",0

The company supports homeless shelters and food service for people as well as all they do for homeless pets.",1
"I took my dog to this PetSmart for a bath. I was visting from out of town, and had no experience with the groomers here, but how can you screw up a simple bath? \n\nWell, when I picked up my dog, she emerged from the back room with her front legs covered in blood. \n\nThe groomers told me \""""Oh, she must have caught her dew claws while pawing at the crate door.\"""" We walked her over to the in-store vet to get cleaned up and checked out. The vet's assistant also determined that she must have caught her dew claws on the crate door. \n\nMy dog does have separation anxiety, and that's why I asked the groomers to call me as soon as she was done with her bath. I was there within five minutes of receiving the call. She's been to other groomers, and I sometimes crate her at home. She doesn't like it, but she's never bloodied herself. \n\nAfter I got my dog home, she became lethargic and wouldn't move. When she finally did get up, she made a loud yelp. I checked her out, and she yelped more as I moved one of her legs, so it was clear something more was wrong than just a pulled dew claw. \n\nI returned to the vet at the store (and this time saw a vet, not an assistant). She said that my dog likely sprained her ankle, and that we could do x-rays, but that my dog probably wouldn't be able to stand at all if she had broken something. \n\nBut perhaps the most disconcerting thing is that the vet mentioned that she's seen other dogs coming out of the groomers with injured paws. The crates apparently have wire mesh floors - not smooth floors like you'd have in a home crate - and that dogs can hurt themselves if they paw at the floor. \n\nThe store did pay for the vet visit and pain medication for my dog - it would have been ridiculous had they not - but how can they continue to use unsafe crates? And is their  policy to simply ignore dogs who are freaking out and may be hurting themselves in these unsafe crates?",0
"Horrible care. The staff knows the wire mesh crates hurt pet's paws on multiple occassions, and yet they do nothing about it. Shame on PetSmart, which should be renamed PetCruel.",0
"The cat food our cats eat is not sold at Target or grocery stores, so we have to shop at PetSmart. I both love and hate PetSmart. I love it because it's easy to navigate and I can get in and out rather quickly. I love that I can also browse and take my time because there are so many different things to look at. I love looking at the birds, reptiles, small animals but at the same time I hate seeing the animals for adoption because it makes me so sad! I wish I could adopt them all! I usually try to only go on the weekdays, since adoptions are always held on the weekends. I usually need my husband for moral support if we go on the weekends, otherwise I'd come home with 10 new pets every weekend!",1

They will quote you low and then give you the \""""but once you get here the groomer will let you know what it will be for sure\""""....

Pretty bummed. My dog has been using petsmart for everything.  We use Banfield.  She's loved doggy daycare. She occasionally needs a professional bath and nails trimmed. I picked her up last night she was still wet! Luckily it's hot out. She has matts in her hair! Her nails are not trimmed. I asked she said she did them. Not at all. What a waste! I now need to find a new groomer in fear this happens again.  I think she was in a rush! Regardless I paid full price and not sure what I paid for!,0

"I hate to be a dick. And by that, I mean giving a Taco Bell a poor rating on Yelp. But there are just some things that need to be brought to attention. \n\nThis Taco Bell is extremely close to my house, which makes it an easy stop for a quick lunch or dinner or even snack. Two separate times I've been here come to mind. \n\nOne was late on a Tuesday night, and my boyfriend and I decided to order at the counter and eat in the dining area. In our order, we asked for two sides of their nacho cheese. The young kid at the counter (who was polite) told us that there wasn't any nacho cheese, no big deal. He told us to hold on a minute, went into the back and asked his manager (we could hear him) where she told him just to tell us that we were out. Kind of suspicious..? Just tell them we're out? Huh. Okay. So we sat down, and about two minutes later the kid comes out and says that now they do have nacho cheese. Wow. Miracles do happen. Or, the management staff just made and employee lie to customers. It's called business ethics, people. She could have told him to say \""""It'll be ready soon\"""" or \""""Sure we're just making it right now\"""" but no, he was told to lie. Which is not his fault at all, but is the fault of the management staff. Food that day was nothing to get excited about. It's all Taco Bell and honestly you can't expect much. \n\nThe second time we came here, we went to the drive through and in our order ordered 2 orders of cinnamon twists. We got home, luckily not far away, to find out that the cinnamon twists were shorted from our order. We drove back, and the same kid was at the drive through. He was nice enough to toss in a free cinnamon twist bag. However, when we got home my boyfriend nearly broke a tooth on one of the \""""cinnamon twists\"""" that was actually an uncooked rotini-style pasta noodle covered in the cinnamon sugar. This was the part of the meal that really upset me. Taco Bell does not carry anything remotely close to pasta, meaning that the noodle had to have been placed in there on purpose or by some extremely odd and rare accident... It could have resulted in something extremely dangerous (breaking a tooth), but we were lucky enough that his pain was just temporary. Pictures of the noodle will be posted shortly.",0
"I know it seems like I'm snarking, but I'm not.  It's expected by most that a business stays open for its posted hours.  I went by tonight at 11:45pm.  Guess what?  Closed to the point of even the outside lights being off.  It was a black hole in the parking lot.  According to Taco Bell's website, they should have been open.  I wonder if the franchise owner is aware their employees are shutting down before their closing time.\n\nCall me crazy, but I expect a business to be open when it claims it will be open.",0

The vet never asked me about my dogs past shot records. It turns out your dog only needs rabies shot every three years. When we asked them about it... They said they gave us paperwork and told us it was every 3 years but they didnt. They were just giving him the shot and collecting money.. No questions asked. How unprofessional! I will never take my 5 year old chihuahua back again.",0
"We have two dogs and joined the Banfield plan, with the full intention of getting fantastic service while saving money. (Banfield offers a plan where you pay monthly per pet and get free office visits with basic vaccinations included, and discounts on services/medications outside of your plan. We pay $25 per dog monthly). We have been incredibly disappointed, and here's why:\n- Our office visits are never free, the doctors always find a way to charge you for something. One time one of their vets tried to talk us into a $150 test to see if she licked a poisonous toad.. seriously?!? \n- I never feel like we are taking the dogs ta good, honest vet - Banfield feels more like a corporation that needs to hit a certain number every month - hence why they are always billing you for things you don't need and overcharging you.\n- With our plan, we're supposed to save money. However, I've researched local vets and their services are nearly half the price than my \""""discounted ones\""""\n- Every time a Banfield vet prescribes our dogs medicine, our \""""discounted savings\"""" are nearly TWICE what the medicine is priced at online.\n- They are VERY sneaky with their plan. They do not tell you when they are renewing your annual contract. Once it's renewed, you cannot get out of it for a full year (we have tried SO many times). Of course this was never discussed when we initially signed up for it. Only in the fine print of our numerous page contract.\n- I'm disappointed with the quality of healthcare the dogs have received. Nobody seems to know the answer to health problems when I take them in there. I'm still waiting to hear back from a fungal culture they took 11 days ago, our poor dog is still covered in a rash. \n\nOverall, I'm convinced Banfield and their animal plans are a scam. Support local businesses, save money and take your pets to a local pet hospital. Our contract is up next June thank goodness - that cannot come soon enough!!\n\nI posted this same review for the Desert Ridge location because we have taken our dogs to both (in hopes that one was better than the other) - unfortunately, we had the same experience.",0
"Banfield is way overpriced and after finding a much better vet (honest, more knowledgeable, not focused on money) I realized how crappy this place really is. Would NOT recommend. I have yet to know someone that has had a positive experience with any Banfield, but this is the location I have personally used.",0
"Just waiting for my contract to end. In an emergency you CAN NOT get your pet seen. My puppy was dying from Parvo and they would not fit him in.They told me to go to a pet ER...why am I paying for this  insurance?? I found a vet that is not sales driven...and cheaper than my price with \""""insurance\"""". Horrible....I have steered multiple friends away from this mistake since I have signed up. Never again.",0
"Don't let the suit's fool you...\n\nI don't hang out in Paradise Valley too much, however I went to meet with a local radio/writer celebrity at the local starbucks. As I pulled in to the parking lot I noticed Ambassador Fine Cigars. After the meeting I took a stroll on down to the store with my wonderful mocha. First saw dood in a suit smoking and I was like ok nice. Then old guy came with a suit and I was like oh damn these guys work here!!\n\nAfter all that noise, I was thinking what the hell did I walk into... the prices are going to be outrageous! I asked him where the Padron's were and he kindly showed me. This walk in humidor was like no other walk in humidor. HUGE, packed, humidity was great! \""""Just push on the door\"""" the kind gentleman said. I was expecting it to slide open automatically like home depot or something.\n\nWalk to the Cigars I was looking for, Padron 1926 #1 $20.70, Padron 1964 Imperial Maduro $14.70. (prices subject to change over time) These prices were about five dollars cheaper then other local cigars stores in Scottsdale. The other guy on the couch welcomed me back to smoke as the kind old man was telling me we sell all of our cigars at suggested manufacturers retail price. \n\nI will be going to this store again, saving money and smoking fine cigars from Ambassador!",1
"Wow. What a beautiful store. There really is no comparison when it comes to cigar shops in the Valley. Ambassador excels in just about every aspect. \n\nThe best part of the experience is the personalized attention from Mr. Seferian, the stores owner. Mr. Seferian obviously cares deeply about his customers, and knows a great deal about cigars. Highly recommended.",1
These people are so helpful. They don't care if you are new to cigars or not. Great service and selection.,1
"Vartan what can you say about him that hasn't been said. A true gentleman, a humble man, a generous man... hospitality is A++++ at Ambassador. Make time to burn",1
"Gorgeous store, helpful staff, comfortable lounge, great ambiance, best cigar shop I have been to in the United States at least.",1
"This particular Panda Express is so gross....I mean, it's clean.  However, something is not quite right about the food they serve at this one.  Or maybe I just stopped eating Panda Express or it's always been this way and I've been spoiled with delicious Chinese food in SF.  It's not fair for me to compare Panda with that, but c'mon!  Why does this place charge so much, but provide such low quality food?",0
"I moved recently and am not near my favorite Panda Express anymore that was in Ahwatukee. So when I had the opportunity to eat at this one I was glad........   \n\nFood was OK, the usual consistent food that you expect. \n\nBUT on the way out I used the restroom and if I had used it before I ordered, I would have just walked out......    They need to check them more often and just don't put a Wet Floor sign up, actually do something to keep it clean. There were two employee's on break when I came in, so they just need to change their priorities and Clean the restroom BEFORE they take their break!",0
I went to dinner here last night and the food was cold and tasted like it had been sitting for hours. They didn't have a very big selection and I was not impressed.,0
Yay!!! I second the first review!  Blimpie's is bomb and I will never walk in Subway ever again because I hate walking out smelling like bread!!!!  The guys who work here are all super sweet.. and even the women are too... shocking for me to say!  Much cheaper than Jersey Mike's too!,1
"I came here recently for lunch and thought I had walked in on a dinner theater production, or an episode of Seinfeld.\n\nI was standing in line when the owner started yelling at a customer.  At first, I thought they knew each other, but soon I realized it wasn't an act.  To make matters interesting, he then decided not to honor anothers Blimpie card -- because it was stamped from another location: \""""I get nothing from this!\""""  \""""Go away!\""""  I guess there was no sandwich for him, or soup!\n\nDuring these outbursts, some of the customers walked out in confusion.  I just took my sub and left. \n\nIn contrast, the employees all seem very nice and friendly.  But, I'll take a pass in the future and skip the drama. \n\nSorry!",0
"This was not the same place I remembered as a teen in California. Menu was completely different and has a bad attempt of being like a subway. On a good note the bread was fresh, but sadly I won't hit it up again.",0
Not big of a store but very well organized. Nice and helpful staff.,1
"Soooooo... I'm at \""""Bed, Bath, and Beyond\"""" in Paradise Valley picking up items for a trip to Texas. I ask the associate who works there where I might find \""""Black Hair Care Products.\"""" She walks up and down five aisles and is unable to locate products for Black hair.  She calls another associate who also walks up and down the same aisles and is also unable to find anything for my hair.  \n\nAs embarrassed as I was, the expression on both of these women's faces was heartbreaking for me because they both had to acknowledge that there was nothing for my hair on the shelves. Graciously they call their manager, Bryan, who walks over to me and says, \""""We used to have a whole row of product for that kind of hair but no longer carry anything for Black hair. Not enough is sold so we discontinued selling the product. \""""\n\nI know that not everyone will  understand why this HURTS my heart, but in \""""2013\""""  for someone to tell me that \""""Black people\"""" are not worth a space on a shelf speaks volumes about why we as a country can't move forward!  I have friends and family members from every race, creed, and walk of life and  am completely enraged at what I just had to face.  I do not know anyone more culturally sensitive then I am and find myself frustrated that the gentleman that I just spoke to could not understand why I was so upset.  \n\nThe moral of this story, forgive but never forget that we have a long way to go.",0
"Bed Bath and Beyond stands out as the place to go when you're dressing up your bedroom, bathroom, and beyondroom. We like it so much that we put it on our wedding registry. I give this location 5 stars because it's simply the best BBB I've ever been to. \n\nWhat's so great about this location? \n\n1. An integrated Cost Plus World Market with huge assortment of specialty foods and beverages. On certain days, they've got mimosa samples.\n\n2. Amazing customer service. We really felt welcome. They even did a great job of helping us with an online-order return. \n\n3. A special post-wedding discount for couples with a registry. Basically, you go in, they'll print off your registry, and give you a discount on your total purchase that day. There was even a continental breakfast for those who showed up for the occasion. I don't know how often they do this, but it's a tremendous idea. \n\nCome on, it's Bed Bath and Beyond! And, I'm a shameless fan.",1
"This Bed Bath and Beyond keeps getting better they already had a personal care and beauty section; now they added a World Market food section. This new food section is bigger than the food section in a regular World Market store, with wine and beer along with all the gourmet foods you usually find in the standard stores.",1
"This place has a very expansive and cool eclectic collection of toys/figures/playsets/related memorabilia. Priced reasonably and all in good shape. The staff is friendly, helpful and knowledgable. I have gone to many toy shops in Oklahoma ( from there was just visiting the Phoenix area) and none of them can hold a candle to what this shop offers in all of the areas of available stock, customer service and price range. If you are a toy collector, you definitely need to visit this shop if you are in the area.",1
Awesome store! My best friend loves Star Wars and loved this store. Lots of Star Wars collection!! Staff was very friendly and helpful. I will be back again soon!,1
This bare- bone market is a tiny slice of Eastern Europe in Phoenix.  Does your grocery list beg for an assortment of smoked fishes and/or canned pate (from turkey to pork)?  This is also where you can go when only Hungarian paprika will do.\n\nAlso have fun selection of chocolate and candy.,1
I am a big time fan of the Russian honey cake and this place was a disappointment.  The cake had too much shortening added to it and the cake was really dry.  I will not buy honey cake from them again if they will cut out fresh quality ingredients to lower costs.,0
"Yasha's is a fun place to explore.  I was able to find some of the classic East European and Russian foods that I enjoyed throughout my life.  The smoke fish is quite a find including salmon, white fish and even sturgeon.  They do have salmon caviar, but only on occasion can you find Persian caviar from the Caspian Sea.\n\nThey also have a bakery and meats worth noting.  \n\nThe store also stocks some middle eastern cousine and holiday foods.\n\nTry some of the home made salads for a treat.",1
"Yes Yasha does import great Russian food, however the horrible attitude you get from the owner makes you think twice about going to the store. If this was NY or LA he would be long out of business but due to the limited options in Phoenix he thinks he can get away with treating his long time customers like crap. Being Russian I have long come to understand the curt and non-friend behavior of other Russian's but Yasha is all together rude. He belittles and embarrasses his customers, and has his son participate in this behavior as well. If you want great Russian food with out all the b.s head down to the store on 12th street.",0
"I love this place and always stop here when I'm in the area. The smoked fish, sausages, and fresh made breads here are really awesome! Try the small smoked sausages on the deli counter, they are really good. I also love the smoked sturgeon and the excellent selection of salami they have here. The Russian salami is very good, if you like salami you need to try it. If you like pickles try the pickled tomatoes they have here. They also have a nice selection of caviar.",1
This is a nice little place.  Good variety of eastern european meats. My wife was searching for some items she would eat as a kid and Yashas actually carried the items.  They were open on memorial day which was nice.  we will be going back for sure. My wife was looking for Mici which isnt exactly carried at Safeway.  and they had it in the freezer along with a wide variety of meats.  the bakery items looked awesome. i will have to update my review when we  go back.,1
"Not nearly as good as Russian groceries in other cities.  Some bakery items are stale depending on turnover. Vegetables are hit or miss,  But some items worth the trip. Husband and wife owners could be friendlier. Speaking in Russian helps.",0
"If you are from the FSU or FSU Jewish, this is the store for you and your staples.  Good selection of food from home for those yearning a taste",1
"This office was recommended to me by a friend. Unfortunately, I had a bad experience. The office staff is rude and not at all helpful. They seem too busy to be bothered by even the simplest questions. The nurses and doctors don't listen, and did not even give me the opportunity to ask questions even considering that this was my first pregnancy. I literally felt  like I was being pushed out of the office the 3 times that I went. It took 5 phone calls to finally be reimbursed for the money I paid them.\n\nI would not recommend this office to anyone. I have met several other pregnant women who have also switched doctors after visiting them.",0
"I came to this office due to location and it being in my insurance network. Initially my experience was positive, as I worked with a doctor named Stephanie Nguyen who seemed caring and attentive, and even once personally called me to give me test results. \nUnfortunately however I am not reviewing her, but the office as a whole. After she left to go on maternity leave, things began to go downhill. \nUnder her care I was prescribed an ultrasound due to uterine pain. I was not notified of her departure, but simply got a phone call from a stranger saying I had hemorrhagic cysts and polyps and that I needed a follow up ultrasound within 10 days of the start of my next cycle.\n\n Following the new doctors instructions exactly, I called the front desk to schedule my ultrasound, explaining to the receptionist on the phone that I needed to schedule an ultrasound within 10 days per the doctors instructions. The woman on the phone scheduled me for an appointment with the doctor very quickly, and considering I knew they did not always have ultrasound techs on staff (they have outside techs come in from an office called Fetal & Women's Center of Arizona) I wanted to make sure we were on the same page. I verified with her multiple times the time and the location of the appointment, that there would be ultrasound equipment and technicians on duty, and explained that due to my narrow window of time (10 days from the start of menstruation) how important it was to get this appointment done right. The woman's tone was dismissive but confident, and I let it go.\n\n Surely enough however, when I showed up for my appointment four days later the nurse on staff said they could not do my ultrasound and  casually closed my chart saying there must have been a misunderstanding because they did not have any ultrasound techs on duty on Thursdays. I was upset and asked to speak to a doctor. In the end I was treated rudely, dismissed, and told to reschedule my own appointment. \n\nUnfortunately, due to their irresponsible staff, I will now have to walk around with hemorrhagic cysts and polyps for another month (until after next menstruation), with no questions answered. Needless to say, I will never be returning to this office.\n\nLong story short - the staff does not listen, the office has multiple locations and outside ultrasound services which they seem incompetent about keeping track off, I was treated poorly and expected to fix their scheduling mistakes, I drove down to an office location despite their not being the resources necessary to perform my procedure and no one resolved this issue, and I will now have to wait until my next menstruation to discover more information about my ovarian cysts and polyps due to their oversight.",0
"I was referred by a friend and have had nothing but trouble with this office.  In November I found out I was pregnant and was having issues before my first appt; I had an emergency and had to get in right away and ended up seeing another doc.  I won't give names, but that doctor basically beat around the bush to tell me I was miscarrying instead of telling me flat out.  My husband literally played 20 questions with that doc to get a simple answer.  It was ridiculous.  Also in Novemeber I had the office call me on two different ocassions to reschedule because they made a \""""scheduling error\"""".  As far as I'm concerned thats something they should fix since people take time off to make appts in the first place.  Fast forward to today, another emergncy appt and I just got a phone call from them that they canceled my appt. I am so furious with the way that they run this office.  Try and make your schedule work, don't cancel people.  I'm livid and would not return here if you paid me to!",0
"I had the worst experience of my life back in January. \n\nI booked an appointment with CWH because I found out I was pregnant Christmas day. The front staff was so rude on the phone. The girl I spoke to treated me like I was an inconvenience and how dare I call in to book an appointment. I should have cancelled at this point but I was excited with this being my first pregnancy. \n\nOn the day of my appointment I had to wait over an hour for my appointment to start. Then once I was taken back I had to wait another 30 mins for someone to see me in my room. Tracy came and was the nurse practitioner. She was amazing but I hear she is not longer with them. \n\nNow to the tragic part. I informed them that I would be having my 8 yr old son come in for the ultra sound because we were trying to make him feel like his apart of the process. Dr. Nelson came in. Dr. Nelson has no bedside manner what so ever. He proceeded to tell me right in front of my son that I was going to miscarry. He drop the bomb with little to no bedside manner. He could have asked my son to step out and then tell me. Then he walked out with out explaining anything and basically just dipped out. \n\nObviously I was devastated. I came back two days later to give blood work . Again the front staff was rude and dismissive. The girl told me that they MIGHT call me back the next day and if not give them a call whenever. I don't feel this is satisfactory for someone who is terrified waiting to hear if there baby is not going to make it. \n\nI ended up going with another OBGYN to have my medically induced miscarriage. CWH with out a phone call to follow up with me proceeded to send me a $7000.00 bill for a pregnancy that they deemed was not viable in the first place. You would think it would have been written down somewhere that I was no longer going to need prenatal care after I told them I was going to go somewhere else, my new doctor's office called them, and they DIAGNOSED my miscarriage.\n\nOver all this place is extremely unprofessional and is not a good choice for a first time mom or any mom. They obviously do not have the bedside manner to deal with a difficult pregnancy or with a woman who has to deal with a difficult decision.",0
"My first visit to Camelback was a couple of days ago on the recommendation of a good friend. I was fed up with the questionable, indifferent, and invasive and yet incomplete treatment at my old gyn office. My friend told me so many great things about Camelback over the last couple of years, yet I still stuck with my old gyno thinking things would get better and that their methods were probably the same as every other facility's anyway. But three years and five invasive and useless colposcopies later, nothing had changed. \n\nWell, you know how they say that sometimes you don't realize how bad things truly were until you experience the difference? They're right. \n\nI saw Julie Bergdale, NP supreme and all the hype on Yelp about her is true. The most striking thing besides her kind, smart, funny and compassionate demeanor is that she actually listens, truly LISTENS to you and absorbs your info, even the subtle bits. She wanted to know all about my health history, my concerns, and habits. For the first time since I moved here from CA, I felt like I was going to be cared for properly by my gyno office! (I left my truly awesome gyno of 18 years, Dr., Gerardo Bustillo, back in CA and so regretted it. But now, I think I may have some hope of a great experience again.)\n\nI had to wait longer than at my old place, but that's no biggee because it's only due to Julie spending quality time with each patient. And for that, I'm HAPPY to wait! What good is efficiency without quality? For the first time in three years of living in AZ, I got ALL of my many questions answered. Not danced around or dismissed, but answered intelligently and thoroughly. I'm the kind of a patient who knows my body well and takes the time to read books and studies and asks questions, so I need an office that not only doesn't mind but that prefers well-informed patients. Julie decided to do a full metabolic panel, plus CRP, plus cholesterol (amazing) and a hormone panel to boot based on my family history. This should really help establish a nice baseline from where to work. Sensible.\n\nWhy this was never done at my old office, I do not know. The staff and doctor absolutely hated questions, and as she reminded me many a time, placed the weight of their decisions on predetermined, one-size-fits-all protocols. My last phone conversation with my doctor, (a full 3.5 weeks after a mysteriously painful and stressful biopsy episode that threw my period off by two weeks) was very sad indeed. The gist of it? Apparently everything is the patient's fault at her office, even when monsels solutions may be mixed wrong and cause reactions....Very disappointing, yet not surprising. Nothing had changed. That's when I knew I really had to leave.\n\nBut not to worry. They say many times out of adversity comes understanding and positive change. After coming to Camelback, I know now that my last bad experience served as a painful wake-up call to me about my health and being more proactive and engaged moving forward. For the first time in years, I have high hopes of great care for the future. If the NP is this good, I believe this bodes well for the doctors. \n\nOh, and as a bonus, they have places that do mammograms and bone scans right downstairs from their office, so if you need those like I do, you can add convenience to their list of attributes, too.",1
"My issue is with Dr. O'sullivan. She's straightforward, no sugar coating, no emotion, no small talk, just strictly to the point. That's usually not my go to type of doctor but besides the personality factor I didn't have any other reason to switch at the time. \nI guess I should have gotten worried when she prescribed Zoloft for me because I was \""""depressed\"""". I've never been treated for depression nor had any other doctor ever bring it up. I was young, unmarried, still in school and pregnant with horrible morning sickness. Would you be thrilled? I did not take the Zoloft, which now has a huge law suit for birth defects! She also wanted to give me zofran for my morning sickness which I refused to take as well. \nI went into labor at the hospital at 8pm and dilated until about 4 am that morning. Dr. O'sullivan didn't show up until almost 6am. My daughter sat in the birth canal so long that when she was born she was not breathing. My heart dropped when I didn't hear my baby crying. What did the doctor do? Nothing! Absolutely nothing. She stood there looking so confused. The nurses ran the baby over to the table and called a code. Other nurses literally ran in and revived my daughter getting her to breathe. Dr . O'sullivan did not even touch my daughter once while all that happened she just watched. If it wasnt for the amazing staff at good Sam my daughter would not be here or may have had long term effects. Even worse is that the same thing happened to my cousin. Dr O'sullivan was her OB and took a very long time to show up at the hospital as well. My cousin had already had two children so she knew the risks of waiting and told the hospital she's not waiting anymore so go get the doctor on staff. The dr at the hospital delivered her baby with no problems but just imagine if she had waited for Dr. O'sullivan to show up what could have happened.",0
As pleased as punch I had a very negative experience with my first health care center but now I could not be more pleased. Dr. Nelson is Amazing and so kind. I started coming here on the recommendation of a good Friend. Everything is handled in a completely professional manner. Only one time did I have an extra long wait time but it was explained to me when I checked in. the entire staff is professional and warm. they remember you ever time you return and are always smiling. I would recommend this office to any of my friends!!!!,1
"I went to see O'Sullivan for a 2nd opinion about other options before deciding on a hysterectomy. Next day, I get a nasty call from her instructing me to rush myself to Good Samaritan b-cuz according to her lab result, I was chronically anemic, making it sound like I was dying; therefore I needed to undergo a blood transfusion ASAP. I was in shock & asked for time to see who can take me. She Insisted I drive myself (which didn't make sense). She reported she has reserved a bed for me & my blood units have been waiting since 9am. I arrived the hospital @ 2pm & was sent to my room to WAIT for these blood units to arrive. In other words, an order wasn't even placed until I arrived. Even worst, it didn't arrive until 9pm. The whole while I was waiting in the \""""expensive\"""" private room, the hospital team kept insisting O'Sullivan reported I was there for a hysterectomy. I was even threatened that if I don't cooperate with the hysterectomy,I would die. I told them I thought I was there for a blood transfusion. After being interrogated for hours, I became to understand getting a hysterectomy would be a \""""financial convince\"""" for O'Sullivan. I saw my PCP after the transfusion & was told I didn't need the transfusion. All I needed was daily iron pills. When O'Sullivan's office called me to \""""schedule\"""" the hysterectomy, I informed them I no longer want services from O'Sullivan & will be seeking services elsewhere. They attempted 2 more times to schedule a hysterectomy. \nJust last week, I received a certified letter from O'Sullivan stating she will no longer provide services for me because I refuse to follow her medical advice. What part of I no longer want her service did she not understand????\nShe didn't care for me or about me, she just wanted to butcher me for her financial sake. As if she had a ballon payment due & I could've been her ticket. It's been 5 months since she & her hospital team threatened I would die. Makes me wonder how many others she has victimized.",0
"I recently stopped going here after 4 years. I was prescribed a birth control pill and not told about the side effects, which landed me in the ER for a week.  I talked to the office afterwards and was told it was my problem, and not the doctor's job to advise me.  Yet I still went back, this time for a hysterectomy consultation. I made the appointment approx. 2 weeks in advance, arranged for time off from work, etc. I arrived and paid my copay and waited nearly 20 minutes, only to be told that the office girl had screwed up and scheduled me with an NP instead of a surgeon, even though I was extremely clear about what I was coming in for. I demanded my copay be refunded and left. I do not recommend this practice at all!",0
"Never Ever recommend this place to anybody. \nMy OBGYN here just wanted to fill me up with pills and plan immediate surgery for issues that had various other option, but she insisted on surgery as being the only way out.\nI thank my stars that I listened to my body and instinct and not her bossiness.\nThis is not a Dr's office but a human dissecting and pill filling factory.\nDon't waste your time going to this place.",0
"This place will make u upset every time u come because the wait times are excruciatingly long and nobody here gives a crap about it. The front desk is defensive and rude from the start. I have come here multiple times and waited upwards of two hours. Not exaggerating, and not a soul in that office ever apologized. Drs to be fair are good but u will end up bald from pulling your hair out from frustration if u go here.",0
"I had the most horrendous experience at this place. Besides dealing with a very rude doctor (Erin O'Sullivan) -- she talks about other patients, has a knack for making you feel like a fool for asking a question or being concerned, and was flat out mean during the birth... she acted like I had inconvenienced her -- I had to have surgery nine weeks after my baby was born for a fistula. Very LONG (and physically painful) story short: After dealing with some post-tear issues, which required restitching at the two week mark by Steven Nelson (I was done with O'Sullivan), I thought I was on the mend. I saw Nelson a few more times after that. At the seven week mark, Nelson said that there was a small hole (about 7mm deep) and he cleared me. I decided to get a second opinion, just in case... an extra hole \""""down there\"""" concerned me. Good thing I did. The hole was, in fact, a fistula and I had to have surgery to repair the damage. The recovery time from that: another 6 weeks. \n\nPlease do yourself a favor and consider another doctor/practice. It was my first and I wish I had listened to my gut in the middle of pregnancy and moved on. There's no reason you should have a lousy experience when there are so many great OBs out there who want you to have a fabulous pregnancy and birthing experience.",0
Lousy! You're a file number.,0
"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. We went to men's warehouse thinking it would be an easy accessible place to rent tuxes for our small wedding party of 3 plus the groom. When we went in to inquire about rentals we were told that it was cheaper to buy which we thought was weird but we decided to trust the sales associate and buy which ended up costing over $200 per suit after alterations. When we bought my husbands suit, who was the groom we paid a deposit plus the fee to rent all shirts and ties. When our grooms party went in to pick up shirts and ties they were charged for something we had already paid for. The best-man was called to pick up his suit, saying all alterations were done, when in fact the pants weren't even started. The tailor job was awful and fit him horrible, I'm assuming since they had to rush the hemming. We requested all items to be transferred to one store, and of course none if it had been, leaving us scrambling around town trying to get things together. Awful customer service, no one knew anything when our party came in, tried to over charge us when we had our receipts. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. Not worth the crappy service, crappy tailor job and definitely not worth the stress on your wedding day.",0
"Not a bad apartment complex if you're looking for cheap but with cheap comes poor service from management. First of all if the management likes you then they will at least half way do things. It takes them weeks to get a service request taken care of. During those weeks they will give you countless excuses, they looks for ways to complain about something leaving letters pinned to your front door. The rules are only enforced on people they have a problem with. I'm not saying all the management is bad, but the people running the show need practice. \n\nThe machines at the laundry facility only half way work. The pool doesn't get cleaned much, if there is something wrong that they don't believe or feel like fixing they blow you off in an unprofessional way. There are lots of people that don't pick up after their pets. There are only 4 dog stations on the whole property. \n\nIt's always loud here with kids trying to run you off the sidewalk with their bikes. The pool is loud at night with people screaming and kids during the day filling the hot tub with bubble bath that overflows into the pool.\n\nI don't recommend living here unless you like poor quality living standards and rude staff.",0
"My 76 year old mother went in to buy replacement pads for her pool vacuum and was treated extremely rudely by Bob. He was the only person there, busy, and spoke in an ornery tone. I was on the phone listening to him yell and just talk like a jerk to my mom and other customers. Bob needs some anger management classes. And this store needs to ditch Bob in place of someone who can be polite and knows a thing or two about customer service. NEVER patronizing this store again.",0
"Now that I've had a couple of visits to Camelback Women's Health, a review is appropriate.  After finding them on an internet search for prenatal services, I called and spoke to a couple of women.  After answering many of my questions over a few calls, I was ready to make an appt.  ask me what my choice of Dr was and I simply ask them to set me up with the one they preferred... enter, Dr. Gregory DeSanto.\n\nI was always told that picking your maternity doctor was quite the chore.  It's joked about in movies and a matter of stress for many women.  I'm a lil more laid back than the average woman about such matters but, after I met Dr. DeSanto, I really didn't see the need to go to a dozen different doctors and stress.  He's relaxing, knowledgeable and does things himself that other doctors pass off to technicians - like my ultrasound.  He did an excellent job explaining everything he was doing, getting great angles of my lil baby and even showing me the gender before others say they can tell.  It was the most amazing experience to see my lil guy flipping around!!  I'd heard other women say that their ultrasound tech didn't tell them much and actually had them worried by not talking and explaining things but, there was none of these issues with DeSanto.  I'm a fan of his calm demeanor and simple, easy-going approach to things.\n\nThe reason for taking away a star is that on both visits, I've felt there could be a lil more communication with the the ladies in the office.  The first visit, I told them on check-in that I had 2 appts and even wrote in the information on the sign-in sheet but, they never sent me down to my first appt.  I didn't know there's almost no wait time at this clinic, (unlike other doctor's offices) so I sat there waiting forever and finally ask when it was almost time for my 2nd appt. because I was afraid they were going to overlap.  Luckily, they were able to fit me in for my 1st appt after my 2nd appt but that whole situation could have easily been avoided with a lil more communication.  On the 2nd visit, after my weight/vitals check, I was told to that I needed to start a test but then she left me without any instructions on where to go or what to do after that test.  I think it was assumed I knew the drill already because I am in my 2nd trimester, but that was only my 2nd appt.  \n\nThose lil glitches were barely noticeable though compared to the satisfaction I feel with the clinic overall.  \n\n* Dr DeSanto is knowledgeable, calming and explains things well.  And Jamie was so helpful with many of my misc. questions and helping me get set-up!\n\n* They have their own lab and ultrasound machine in their clinic so you don't have to run around, wait, or make separate appts for lab work!\n\n* Everyone is friendly enough and it feels like a cozy, comfy environment.  \n\n* There is little waiting time before your appt starts and they must keep gaps in the day because you can get in to see the Dr. in a timely manner.\n\nI'll be back next month for my 6 month check-up!\n\nSee ya there!",1
"I found this doctors office when I became pregnant and boy did i wish I would of switched doctors offices, but I'm new to the area and stuck it out. It wasn't so bad in the beginning, but now I wish I was completely done with them. The nurses are rude and complain about actually doing their jobs. They find filling out maternity paperwork to be a hassle and don't fill it out correctly. When your company calls you to inform you of this the nurse becomes even ruder to you and explain that your not their patient. Well I feel i shouldn't have to babysit and make sure paperwork that was sent back twice now should be completed properly and not blow me off. To top it off my doctor seems to now be a complete space case lately and cant seem to keep up with what week I'm on, until reminded by me. I know I'm not the only patient she has and I can understand a few slip ups but it seems to be this way for awhile.",0
"I am SO happy with my \""""new look\"""".  I still am getting lots of compliments and both feel and look at least 10 years younger! Both Julie and Debra are very skilled and I cannot imagine trusting anyone else with my face. I tell all my friends, and would recommend  this team to anyone who wants a wonderful  experience that  is performed in a safe and professional setting. Office staff is friendly and I can say that I am extremely satisfied. Botox can be a scary decision for the first time but Julie really made the experience fun .  Best decision I ever made!",1
"This review is for the Camelback office. This office has been very difficult since I started going there last month for my pregnancy.  I was referred by a friend to Dr O'Sullivan and because of an emergency I was only able to get in with Dr De Santo.  I have had about 3 about in a 6 week time.  The three appointments I had made were made to my convenience, around my work schedule.  I was called three times, once for each appointment to reschedule.  These reschedules had nothing to do with the doc running to the hospital to deliver a baby, they were simple errors made at the front desk.. on three different occasions.  Very frustrating to say the least.  I had to reschedule all three of my appointments and miss work each time.  Every time they called to reschedule, I would still get a reminder call for the appt they had just cancelled (which was automated and after hours).  Not only was that annoying, but I worried I would be charge a no show fee (with their own fault) and would call them first thing in the morning to point out their fault and to make sure I didn't have an appt.  They never sounded surprised that I was telling them that THEY had rescheduled me and that I didn't'  have an appt.  One day, I had to stop by in the morning, first thing to give blood.   I was told that they open at 8--and that was great because I wouldn't be missing work (I just started a new job and really don't want to be coming in late all the time or using PTO), when I arrived at 8 for blood work (along with 2 other women also there for blood work), the front desk informed us that the lab technician is not in to take blood until 8:30am, another break in communication from the front desk.  I would not recommend this office and as soon as I am done with my follow-ups I am out of here!  The doc himself is very knowledgeable but is not moving along with treatment for my miscarriage, and does not listen to mine or my husband's concerns.  He is also not very personable and doesn't take the time to explain things--rather he beats around the bush.   I also enjoyed how at every appt they would ask when your last period was, \""""hello, I'm pregnant!  And my last period hasn't change the last 3 times you've asked---look it up on the chart!\""""  This office is very unorganized!  They made me feel like a number and not a valued patient.",0
"Bad customer service.  I was on my third rescheduled appointment (the doctor had to reschedule); I show up to my 3rd rescheduled appointment only to be told the Nurse Practitioner was running 1 hour and 20 minutes behind.  I came from work to this appointment.  They could have picked up the phone to let me know!  \n\nI asked if since I lived up the street if I could come back in an hour and was  told \""""no\"""" they would take me back right away.  To do what?  Sit there naked in a gown for an hour and a half?  No thanks!  Will be going elsewhere from now on.",0
"Dr. De Santo is amazing! He took care of me in the middle of my pregnancy with no questions asked and did a wonderful job. This was my 4th baby coming into the world and I knew I was going to have a c-section, I have to tell you I do not have a scar! Its amazing, this was my 2nd c-section so Dr. De Santo cleaned up my previous scar and tissue and left me looking flawless! He truly cares about your overall health as well and will make life improving suggestions to you. Great practice OH his nurse Esther is pretty awesome as well! Don't let being put on h",1
"While office staff seem competent and things move along in a timely manner, I do not sense the happiness or joy of the staff working there coming out through their customer service: minimal to no greeting, same at checkout, with frowns among staff. Perhaps they feel worn, competitive, or restricted, but the energy could be more warm, inviting or welcoming.",0
"Horrible phone service from janae, and very over priced.  They tell you that you have to get all these things before you can get what you actually even need to come in for.",0
"I cancelled my appointment after waiting over 8 months to be seen because I cannot trust to receive proper care when the office won't even send you a call, email, text or letter to confirm your appointment.  I am a physician myself and cannot believe the office handles scheduling so poorly. I hope the medical care would justify the wait for an appointment but the poor image left by the front office is enough to not want to do business with them.",0
"I wish I could give less than one star. There is no communication between the staff, their attitudes are poor at best, their reception is sloppy and they are commonly overbooked, and they frequently change insurance policies without contacting their patients about having to find a new office. I have never been so disgruntled with an office experience in my life and I would highly recommend finding absolutely anywhere else to take your business.",0
"I was pregnant and my new dr was O'sullivan. It was my first pregnancy so I was so excited.  The staff was nice buti was always waiting 30 mins to an hourafter my scheduled appointment.  Dr. O'sullivan was always very short with me and made me feel dumb for asking questions.  When I gave birth,  she told my family to shut up before my baby entered the world,  which is just plain rude.  Her nurse practitioner was awesome and that's who I saw about 90 percent of my visits.  But the Dr. I'm glad I will never go back to her clinic.",0
"Dr. Lykins was great...but the office staff was horrible!  \n\nHe saw my two kids (2 and 4) to have tubes removed.  Not sure why I had to come back for the second appointment, but I think it was a $$ thing...anyway, suppose to have surgery in two days and I canceled both!   The office insisted that I had to pay before the surgery (to the tune of $35)...but they hadn't billed for the kids last appointment.  If they had we would be at our deductible and owe NOTHING!  The lady argued with me about it...I was so upset, I have another appointment for the kids on Monday with another ENT to have their tubes out...what a circus!",0
"Lacks Integrity, \n\nSo i was referred to Entegrity about a  consultation on possibly having surgery. My visit was  all of about 3 minutes where the doctor took a look and said that i might want to consider surgery. I opted not to do the surgery, and then got a bill for $744.00, of course my insurance paid half but i was on the hook for the rest. I called in and tried to qualify why i would have to pay for a simple consultation, the ladies at billing were matter of fact about what I had owed. $740.00 for a simple consultaion that took 2 minutes.\n\nI would make sure that you know what they are going to charge you before going into their office. I wonder if the insurance companies know that they are over billing when ever they can. \n\nComplete rip off. They should be ashamed,",0
"Entegrity...hmm...a play on words for Integrity?  I don't think so, not even close.  For this office, it's all about the almighty dollar. \n \nI have no issue with the mounds of paperwork I have to fill out each time I come in....but really, how many copies of my insurance card does your office need?  I don't even get upset when I have to sit for 20 minutes before and after I get taken back to see someone.  I'm a bit unnerved when the original issue I came in for is not addressed by the doctor and instead I am herded into other treatments.   I get a little frustrated when I have to jump through hoops to get a refill on my sublingual meds.  I get upset when I get charged a co-pay for a \""""check in\"""" visit for the previously mentioned at-home self administered medication every 3 months.  I get angry when I am charged a $100 fee for rescheduling an appointment.  Had I been dishonest regarding my situation and kept the appointment instead of informing the office (who did not mention the fee during the reschedule), I would have only been charged my normal co-pay.   However, I get REALLY angry when I am condescended to by the staff.  I agree with the other reviewers regarding the staff being snippy, unaccommodating, argumentative and downright RUDE.   They will not listen to explanations, instead they will site \""""notes\"""" that were written by their incompetent co-workers.  Entegrity, do you call all of your customers liars?\n\nBottom line....This office does not value its customers, only their wallets.  Take your business and hard earned cash somewhere else.  I know I will.",0
"Find another ENT specialist! This was the most unprofessional medical office I've ever visited. The ladies at the front desk simply sat and discussed their tailgating party the entire time and ignored my requests for an answer as to why it was taking over 75 minutes for us to be seen by the doctor. They were rude and condescending. I urge anyone seeking a professional, trustworthy ENT doctor to look elsewhere.",0
"My husband and 7-year old son met with Dr. Bailey at the beginning of December to discuss allergy treatment options for my son. I wasn't there, but my husband felt very good about Dr. Bailey, who seems to be a good doctor. However, the follow-up and communication from this office are absolutely horrible and unprofessional. First, we had to transfer my son's medical records from another office. Then, we waited to hear back from Entegrity to know if my son would be a good candidate for sublingual drops treatment. We waited several weeks and I had to finally call twice to learn that, yes, indeed, my son was a good candidate and that I could order the $200+ treatment for 3 months (not covered by insurance) and pay with my credit card over the phone. I did call back (at least twice) to order the treatment and was told I would get another call to pick-up the treatment. My credit card was promptly charged, and after 10 days, I was still waiting for a call back. I called myself (again) to be told I could come pick-up the treatment at any time without an appointment. I came with my husband and son on a Monday morning, and was just handed a case and 2 forms to sign (including a waiver of liability). No word about the treatment. I asked to talk to someone before signing anything, and then was told that I didn't have an appointment, so I would have to wait! We ended up spending a good hour at the office to finally see someone who answered our questions about the treatment. I was told that in the notes it said the doctor had called us to go over the details (neither my husband not I ever got a call from anyone). Dr. Bailey might be good, and the treatment worth it, but the communication (or lack thereof) is appalling. Do something, Entegrity!",0
"I debated on reviewing this place after my initial visit and thought it wasn't worth it. About 7 months later I had an experience with them again and realized my initial suspicions about them were correct. \n\nLast year I was diagnosed with cancer in my neck & the surgeon who did my biopsy referred me to this place kind of out of nowhere. I had gone to see him on a Thursday for a follow-up (for what was most likely going to be the last time for awhile) & that Monday I was set to start chemotherapy. He thought it was a good idea to see an ENT thinking maybe they could add something to my diagnosis and/or treatment. I thought it was odd to do this so last minute (If I wasn't able to see the ENT the next day...which I was, I even asked my surgeon if he thought I should delay chemo until after I saw the ENT, but he didn't think that was necessary). He was pretty insistent that I go to THIS ENT office. My dad had just got done seeing an ENT for a throat condition, which he (and I) really liked, but my surgeon said he \""""never heard of him\"""" and REALLY wanted me to go to this office (I looked up info on then ENT my dad saw and he has a very good reputation).\n\nI saw Dr. Bailey the following morning. Honestly, I thought he was a good doctor based on the initial exam I had with him. He was thorough & very personable. Since my appointment was scheduled so quickly he didn't have a whole lot of information going in and said he would consult my surgeon and get back to me. I never heard from his office again, but honestly, I didn't think much of it. I was starting chemo and was focused on that. Unless one of my doctors felt it was absolutely necessary to have an ENT involved with my treatment I was fine with never dealing with this office again (not because of Dr. Bailey, like I said, he seemed good) but I already had enough going on with chemo & eventually radiation. \n\nThat being said, I thought the manner in which I was scheduled to come into this office in the first place (and then never hearing from them again) was kind of tacky & it came across like they were just looking for any reason out there to bring in patients (I also understand that my surgeon also shares some responsibility here).\n\nWell, with chemo & radiation complete I recently had a follow-up with my oncologist and he asked about all the doctors I had seen throughout this whole ordeal. He brought up Dr. Bailey (along with my other doctors), and at first I couldn't even remember who that was since I had only seen him the one time. When I said I only saw him once and that was before I started chemo, my oncologist said since technically I DID see him the one time during this whole process he would fax him my latest report (along with all my other doctors). \n\nYesterday I get a phone call from Entegrity saying my oncologist wanted me to come into their office for a follow-up. I thought this was odd since he never mentioned this to me at my last visit (or called me afterwards to tell me this) so I told them I wanted to contact my oncologist's office before scheduling anything (and find out WHY he would want me to schedule something with an ENT). It turns out that he simply faxed them my report (like he said he was going to do), but never mentioned anything about coming back to them for a follow-up. My oncologist's assistant also seemed confused as to why this office wanted me to come back in after 7 months. If the ENT thought there was a reason to come back in based on my oncologist's report that's one thing, but to say my oncologist asked them to schedule me when he didn't is tacky.\n\nAll this just confirmed my initial thoughts that this office comes across desperate for patients. Like I said, I thought Dr. Bailey was good based on my brief encounter with him (which is why I'm willing to give this place a 2nd star). However, I would never come back here...",0
"I had a surgery performed by a physician at Entegrity Ear, Nose, and Throat about three years ago, and I am still in pain. In fact, the pain in my throat is far worse than the painful tonsillitis I suffered from prior to the surgery.  When I went back and told the doctor about my pain, he said pain happens to some patients and there is no telling how long it will last.  I can tell you, the pain radiates from my neck up to my ear and into my head bringing tears to my eyes, and this practice wants me to think this is normal!  I would be wary of ever, EVER, becoming a patient at this practice, if I were  looking for a good ENT go somewhere else. My physician was Jeffrey Dyer, and I think he is arrogant, incompetent, and unwilling to deal with the mess his unprofessional surgery creates. Find someone better!",0
"Well this has been my first visit to entrigrity and I wish I had more to review, but I'm still waiting to be seen! Like most doctors offices, they asked me to arrive 15 minutes early. I did. It is now 54 minutes past my appointment time and still waiting to be seen. Hopefully, the doctor can make up for this. Still waiting...",0
Don't go here. I had a lot of issues with the front office lady. She was rude about my records that should have been transfered to the office. She pretty much did not want to deal with me. \n\nDr bailey was nice but really didn't want to listen to what i had to say and had his own opinions about my vertigo issue. After that visit i never went back.\n\nHe was highly recommended by my doctor but too much hassle and too far for me to drive.,0
"I read the other reviews and only wish I had read them before taking time out of my own day to show up at Entegrity for an appointment. I had taken my daughter to Dr. Bailey in May and Thought he was a good doctor. He wanted to get another CT scan done on my daughter since it had been over a year and was done in California by another doctors office. The office was to call and schedule but never did. I, in the meantime needed to get in myself and scheduled an appointment. Once at the appointment in the waiting room, the office staff said they needed to verify my INSURANCE. they called my insurance and the office staff lady claimed that my Insurance was not in their network. She also claimed to have spoken to the office manager about it and unless I wanted to do a self pay, I would be unable to be seen that day. I called my Insurance company as soon as I left. They told me that they told the front office lady on phone , that they just needed to fill out a pre certification form and whatever balance they did not cover could be billed to patient. Shady? Yes. Dishonest staff as well as completly unable to follow directions due to they not wanting to actually take the time to do paperwork, also very shady. Plus, the office was only concerned that they  may not get paid by patient if a balance? So many things did not add up. My Insurance made notes regarding matter So I can pursue getting answers.  the funny thing is, I made 2 phone calls to the office manager and she has yet to return the phone calls. I suppose they are only at their jobs to collect their paychecks as they run the Doctors business with potential patients into the ground. I would not recommend going to this office only because of the lazy office staff. I feel sorry for the doctors that will and have lost patients due to the carelessness of employees.",0
"I went to Dr. Bailey and he did my operation. He was good. I kept thinking though that the office people were a little rude and only thought of you as a number. After the operation Dr. Bailey kept requesting visits but my insurance changed last January and I could not afford it anymore. I had to owe less than 200 bucks out of pocket when the insurance ran out so I asked to make payments to pay them off. I sent the final payment in with a check in the amount of less than 100.00 wich was a couple of weeks late from it being due, but they were quick to send everything to a collection agent without giving me at least a call. They sent my final check back saying it was too late and that I had to contact their collections. \nEntegrity I think not. They could care less about you. They have an attitude that everyone is rich and you better pay up. Very none empathitic of your situation. Very horrible experience dealing with the condisending women in the billing department squaballing over a couple of hundred bucks when they made thousands off my insurance from me going there.",0
SO MANY MISTAKES!!!  Stay away from this place and it's doctors!  Don't risk your health and well being!,0
"PLEASE READ THIS before going to this office! !!!!\nI scheduled an appointment with Dr Dyer per a referral from my pcp 2 MONTH out, was the earliest appointment with Dr Dyer.  When scheduling my appointment they ASKED FOR MY INSURANCE CARD NUMBERS, which I gave them. I asked the receptionist to please send me the forms for new patients & she told me to go to their website and download them, which I did. I noticed the forms had NO PHONE NUMBER or ADDRESS of their office.  I did complete the forms\nWhich took about half an hour. I drove from south Scottsdale to their office today for my 2:00pm appointment.   I left my home@ 12:15 pm and arrived about 1:00 pm for my 2:00pm appointment.   First thing in the door, there were additional forms to fill out that weren't on their website AND they needed my INSURANCE CARDS AND A PHOTO'S ID, which I provided.  I sat in their waiting room until 1:50 pm when the two ladies at the reception desk called me up to say DR. DYER WON'T SEE ME TODAY because he doesn't take my insurance.   I asked to speak to the office manager since I spent 45 min. Driving there, 45 min. Back home and 1 hour sitting in their waiting room .....   \nI was called in by the OFFICE MANAGER Jackie Sides.  She had EVERY EXCUSE IN THE BOOK. she informed me Dr Dyer had been out of the country,  but has had the insurance forms on his desk for months, but hasn't filled them out yet to update his status with the insurance co.  \n     I asked if Dr Dyer was in the office and Jackie Sides (OFFICE MANAGER) said he is in the office,  but WON'T SEE ME.  She offered to SQUEEZE me in with another Dr , WHICH I DECLINED. I TOLD HER, they have a lot of NERVE, wasting nearly 3 hours of my time.  \nI also SAID, Dr Dyer should see me at THEIR EXPENSE, since NO ONE CALLED ME to cancel on an insurance issue INSTEAD OF WASTING 3 HOURS OF MY TIME.\n     On a second note, the two ladies at the reception desk of ENTEGRITY ear, nose & throat were SOOOOOOO busy conversing, with NOT ONE PATIENT at the reception desk, the phone would ring and they would ask the patients to please hold.  Then a patient would walk in the office and the ladies would ask them to sign in and as soon as they were seated, the ladies would then ask them to come back up to the desk. Then ask them to come up again for things that THEY, the RECEPTIONIST missed. \n     I give this office a RATING OF (F-), I am now a senior and have been to many doctors offices and have N E V E R been treated like this.  Dr. Dyer should be ashamed of himself for 1., NOT SEEING me as scheduled,  REGARDLESS of insurance as they messed up, BUT, I feel he's putting money ahead of my medical needs.  Would it really have cost him to see me for a few minutes,  even if he had to waive his fee.  \n     I WILL N E V E R SET FOOT BACK IN THAT ESTABLISHMENT AGAIN, WITH OR WITHOUT INSURANCE. \nSIM",0
I went to several ENT's without relief before trying this one. I was diagnosed and provided options by my second visit. I no longer have the breathing problems I once had. On a side note I never had any issues with the staff.,1

"*Disappointing, uncaring experience.  No follow-up.  Apparent left-hand/right-hand problems in the office, but at least the office staff is pleasant...*\n\nHeard some good things about this practice, so it came to mind when I had a recent medical issue (and needed to find a new PCP).  \n\nI had some flank pain and then days later had an incident of hematuria (rather unsettling and far too much for me to trust my Internet medical degree).  So, I went ahead made an appointment.\n\nScheduling was smooth/friendly.  Got a relatively quick appointment (called on Friday, appointment on Monday) to see the NP at their new location on Thompson Peak.\n\nDay of the appointment, the desk personnel were friendly, the paperwork normal, and the desk personnel pleasant/friendly.   The wait was quite reasonable (pretty close to scheduled time - unusual for a doctor's office).\n\nThe MA was generally friendly and efficient, and the wait for the NP was short.  The NP was professional (though some might not think of her as \""""friendly\"""" or \""""pleasant\"""").  As a previous reviewer mentioned, she was laptop-focused and efficient.\n\nLeft a quick sample (verified hematuria w/in a few minutes) and received an order for anti-biotics (to fight off any potential kidney infection) and an ultrasound - and told to try and get one right away (to look for stones).\n\nGot an appointment and took care of the ultrasound that afternoon.\n\nThe following evening I experienced some pretty severe flank pain in the middle of the night, but it subsided on its own.  I logged into their patient portal and left a note to that effect.\n\nTwo days later, not having heard anything back (odd as the radiologist's office indicated results would be sent to my PCP next day), I called the office at around 1:45p, and was told that the NP had not reviewed the results yet, but that they would take my callback number and send her message to review the ultrasound.\n\nAt first, I was kind of annoyed, but then, I was actually kinda of happy to hear that it wasn't a priority (must not be that bad).\n\nLater that afternoon (~5:30p), I receive a message via their patient portal from the NP asking if I had gotten an ultrasound and rather curtly telling me that I really need to go get that ultrasound...  HUH?\n\nSo, I sent a reply letting her know that I had gotten the ultrasound and contacted the office earlier that afternoon.\n\nThe next day, I get a call from a pleasant person from their office (not an NP or doctor) letting me know that a doctor had reviewed the ultrasound, and it was clear/normal (no cysts or stones).  OK - cool.  So, of course, I asked, great, what next?  I'd really like to get to the bottom of this... And the answer was literally, \""""Well, I don't know, but at least the ultrasound was clear!\"""" (and I could hear the very genuine smile on the other end).\n\nIt has been 3 days, no response to the message I sent in reply in the patient portal.  No follow-up.  No posting of the ultrasound results to the patient portal.  Nothing.  Silence.\n\nMaybe my expectations are skewed, as I have been somewhat fortunate in never having any real medical issue to date, but when I see myself pissing blood and have unexplained flank pain, I really, really wanna understand why - and I kinda feel like my care provider would generally follow-up quickly on something like this - or at least tell me if there's nothing to follow-up on.   \n\nReally.  You don't even have to call me.  I like technology.  Use your patient portal and copy+paste your notes... Really.\n\nAt the end of the day, I suppose I'm responsible for my own well-being though, and so I will.  I've got an appointment with a new doctor tomorrow afternoon :-).  Maybe it's nothing.  Maybe it's something, but I'll keep looking until I find a care provider that can/would-like-to help me find out.",0
"Reminded today of what terrible experience was... got notification of the bill :-).  Apparently, billing is slow, too.  Right on their statement, it shows my insurance paid on 10/20.  I got the bill this morning (12/17).  \n\n$105 for a 10 minute visit with a PA and a simple urinalysis...  My share is apparently $48.   Even that small amount makes me feel ripped for the complete lack of care.   \n\nFortunately, it did prompt me to find another practice - ironically in the same complex - at Grayhawk Medical who have turned out to be great.",0

"How I ended up at this Whole foods is a bit of a long story. One night some years ago a few friends and I saw a little Indie film called Super Size Me. It was a late show, and by the time we got out most restaurants were closed in the area. As weird as this seems after seeing the movie we were still hungry for dinner. Due to the contents though there was no way anyone wanted fast food. After trying to think of something a friend of mine who had begun dieting mentioned how Whole Foods is open late and has an awesome salad bar. Perfect! \n\nThe salad bar was just what we needed. It had a huge selection and almost everything in it was organic! The store itself was also huge compared to most of alternative grocery stores I have been to. It also seemed to feature much more organic produce. Whole foods is a bit pricey, but if you want the best and healthiest apples you can find you should come here!",1
"Yes, it's expensive, but it's such a treat, and I haven't found another organic grocery in town that has the quality produce, salad bar, cheese selection, meats, seafood, etc... and it all tastes so fresh, healthy, and good!\n\nI returned home to an empty refrigerator after being away on vacation and  since it was New Year's Day, I wanted to start off on the right foot.  So, I went to a yoga class and then headed over to Whole Foods to stock up.  I spent over $100 and brought home 4 bags worth of miscellaneous items to fill up my kitchen with.  (That will probably last me all of a week if I'm lucky).\n\nI will say that the fruit is some of the best I've had in awhile... watermelon, honeydew, mango, and blueberries.  They also have great soup selection - (I purchased chicken noodle, split pea, mushroom barley, and egg flower) and if you want a sweet treat without the guilt, try Bubbies Homemade Mochi Ice Cream.  I've had both the mango and vanilla flavors and they are delicous!\n\nQuality products, impressive selection, helpful staff, and central location... I will be back to visit often, Whole Foods - even if you are a little pricey :)",1
"Ahhhh, Whole Paycheck...\n\nYou want me to buy a $13 piece of refrigerated lasagna, heat it up in a microwave, and then enjoy it in a plastic booth in front of a bunch of cash registers.  That says it all...",0
"Call me what you will -- I am a salad bar snob, and I like me some Whole Foods prepared food on occasion, but this Whole Foods is going to make me drive back to San Francisco for lunch, just to get some spinach in my salad. \n\nSure, I like the outdoor tables, but the salad bar rarely has spinach, the garbanzo beans are pathetic specimens, the tofu is only the herbed type (if they have it), the dressing is in big vats, and can a guy have some corn on his salad more than once every 10 days? \n\nI'm passionate about Whole Foods...in fact I am getting teary about my old local in SF...anyway, this location is not up to par. Maybe it is the location near Frys and Albertsons and Trader Joes. Problem is, I don't want my Whole Foods to compete with those places, I want it to have the best vegan tastiness, great beer, awesome cheese, mouthwatering prepared foods, bizarre oils, veggies, and sauces, and spinach at the salad bar. When I want cheap pasta, soda, beans, and toilet paper, then I'll go across the street.",0
"Yeah yeah, whole paycheck, cry me a river. Everyone knows exactly what to expect here, I'm not going to whine about high prices. The prepared foods area at this WF is much more restrained than at any other WF I've been to, which is sad because I used to love ogling the selections at my Boston shop. I think this location has a somewhat small but interesting wine selection but my real purpose for this review is to talk about the cheese shop. \n\nArizonans have absolutely no cheese culture. Sorry. I love AZ and I'm glad I live here, but when I think about exotic cheese I don't think 'gruyere'. Cheese selection is the only way in which Arizona has failed me, until I met Laura, my Whole Foods Cheese Monger (not Lara of Petit Fromage).  After truly depressing excursions to AJs (their cheese is a JOKE and they should be embarrassed), then Trader Joe's and Safeway I called over to Whole Foods and connected with Laura. I asked her about certain cheeses I was looking for and we agreed to meet that evening to find unique options for a wine tasting I was hosting. \n\n Laura explained that in the heat of the summer her cheese selection is rather sparse and that it would be picking back up in the fall. The cheese area is one of the smaller that I've seen, but there are some fun options beyond a simple Parrano or Gorgonzola Dolce. I saw some of my old favs like Taleggio, Explorateur, and Humboldt Fog and Laura introduced me to a few new friends, like Hirtenkase, the delightful german cheese that is made from some of the most pampered cows in the world! I decided on a refreshing chevre called Fleur Vert from California, Mimolette and Chaubier, though Laura very generously let me taste through a horde of options to find the right cheese and wine pairings. \n\nI really look forward to checking back in with her to see what new treats are in. I hope I can use her expertise for more wine events and I encourage you, nay, I insist you step away from that enormous Costco Manchego and talk to the Whole Foods Cheese staff about your exotic dairy needs. Broaden your horizons!",1
Like any other whole foods. \n\nPrices is outrageous to a point where I rather go to AJ's fine foods. Atleast AJ's staff knows extensively what their product is and super friendly.  \n\nFor organic produce i rather go to sprouts. \n\nThanks but no thanks.,0
"My boyfriend and I love this whole foods! It is bigger with a bigger selection than the one in tempe. The cafe area is huge and so is the deli area. The employees are nice, it seems to have more products and it is like hard to choose which ones you want because it's all organic!\n\nThe problem is it is expensive, but I would pay more if I had the money and I do believe in good quality products within a reasonable price. We usually go there if we stay in Phoenix and not go to Tempe.",1

Over priced yuppie garbage.\nPoor unknowledgable servants.\nGo to the farmers market!,0
"While I LOVE Whole Foods, this location has some of the worst customer service.  Not sure why they have such an attitude, but I avoid this store if possible.\nThe cashier didn't say Hello, or thank you or Good Bye...it was very strange!!",0
"In addition to my grocery shopping, I spent almost 20 minutes just looking thru and reading all of their sunscreen products.  Even though I asked multiple questions during that time all of the clerks were very kind, attentive and informative!  It was a wonderful experience and with their help, I even found exactly what I wanted.",1
Whole foods is one of my favorite places to go for a salad bar. Its always clean and fresh. The staff at the store are always really friendly and helpful. Its always clean and I love all the samples they have out. Some stuff is pretty pricey. but the produce and lunch meat are always about the same as other stores maybe a little bit more but you get organic stuff!,1
"THey screwed up my favorite salad - at least today. The smoked mozzarella pasta salad entered the realm of the inedible and found its way into my garbage can. If I lived closer, I would have returned the poor excuse for lunch. The issue was that they undercooked the main ingredient - the pasta. The tubes were hard and the salad was loaded down with so much mayo that it seemed like i would have been eating mayonaise salad had I continued down that path. Also, the Hatch chiles they claim that they put in the salad could not be tasted and the cayenne pepper kick that identifies this salad was not there either. My first week in Phoenix has provided lousy pizza, food poisoning, bad bagels and now my favorite salad has been tarnished forvever. With the size of the bowl of salad in their case, plenty more people will likely end up angry the next 2-3 days.",0
"This is not Whole Foods! This is Fresh and Easy, which has creepy gmo and processed mainstream foods everywhere.",0
"You lost me at \""""uh if it's empty we probably don't have any more, or at least we uh usually don't but we might\"""".  Really? You are a manager and your first inclination when a customer asks if you have an item in stock in the back is to say you're probably out? I know how you work Whole Foods. I know how disorganized (and usually filthy your back rooms are) and you all like to act like you can't do anything if something is out on the shelf.  I would think if you are going to overcharge for a \""""bunch of junk\"""" (in the words of John Mackey, CEO) then you could at least offer excellent customer service. But, no.  \n\nOh well. I will find the item elsewhere and I won't be back. Every time I'm at Trader Joe's or Sprouts they are super helpful, and refuse to let me leave unhappy. Whole Foods could care less.",0
"Last night I had the worst experience at this whole foods, and unfortunately it happened right after a very nice experience with a sweet, patient, and knowledgeable young lady at the cheese counter.  Thank you Naomi for you kindness and your spot on cheese suggestions!\n\nAs for at least one member of their management team, I can truly say she seriously lacks in the customer service area!  This is what happened.  As I passed by the registers I noticed one of their signature black sample tables.  On it was an open clam-shell container with 2 cookies inside.  I grabbed a cookie and proceeded to go to the produce section.  A few minutes later I was finally ready to check out.  As I was placing my items on the conveyor belt, a short woman with short brown curly hair and black glasses about 15 feet from me began to yell.  I looked up to see what the commotion was about and realized she was yelling at me.  \""""Ma'am... ma'am, just so you know\"""" she exclaimed bitterly, \""""those cookies were NOT samples!\""""  I was so shocked and at that point everyone within earshot was staring at us.  I said I was sorry and I offered to pay for the cookies, and she retorted nastily with \""""If you want to.\""""  The bag girl looked horrified and I was thoroughly humiliated.  At least the cashier realized I made an honest mistake (I found out later that I wasn't the first one to make it) and tried to redeem their store's reputation by reassuring me \""""it was OK.\""""  However she didn't appear to be surprised by this woman's ridiculous and senseless behavior.  I wonder if she makes a habit of berating customers and her employees?  A customer from the other side of the next register actually came around to offer me comfort after this vicious verbal assault.\n\nIn taking the cookie I made a blunder but I already had over $80 worth of groceries in my cart, it wasn't like I was trying to get away with some kind of cookie heist.  This manager should have handled this situation in a more professional manner.  She should have approached me in a kind and informative manner (smile preferred) and brought the error to my attention in a normal conversational volume.  It is BAD business to publicly and uproariously mortify paying customers!\n\nBottom line, I will not ever return to this store!",0
Very small and crowded compared to other whole foods. Selection smaller but still very nice.,0
"I LOVE Whole Foods...  but this location is seriously lacking.  \n\nPoor service...  Acted like we were an interruption at deli area and we were the only customers even close to this area.   They saw us, said \""""We will be with in a bit.\""""  Then we Waited for a considerable time, only to be greeted rather gruffly, \""""are you ready to order?\""""  \n\nOrdered 2 sandwiches to take on a plane.  We asked can you cut them in half and wrap the halves separately?  Response... \""""I'll wrap them together and put them in a box.\""""  I again asked, Can't you please wrap the halves separately?  Response...  Irritated exhaling noise and a verbal \""""OK\""""\n\nIn the future I will stick to the Whole Foods on Mayo Blvd!",0
This place is a cheese ball version of the scottsdale store. It shouldn't even be called by the same name. \nSprouts is much friendlier and even the Frys across the street is cleaner and has better customer service. \nI live between the scottsdale and this store and always regret not going the other way.\n\nEnter happy and leave disappointed.,0
"The service here has really gone downhill.\nI love the concept of Whole Foods and the range of options given. Being a vegetarian/vegan, this is one of the few places that you can come for a whole range of options. The produce here is always great. Plus,I also enjoy the smoothie bar and the pizza that they will put in a to-go box for you.\n\nHowever, there have been 2 times now where I have had lackluster service, sometimes even downright rude. I have come to expect this at lesser stores but not at Whole Foods. One male cashier that we had did not even acknowledge us the entire time he was scanning our items, but instead told awkward inside jokes to his friend who was bagging our groceries. He didn't talk with us through the whole transaction and after the bags made their way into the cart, he shouted \""""Later!\"""" like a surfer dude and resumed chatting with his BFF. This is no way to treat the customers of your store, especially when we drive WAY out of our way to come here.\n\nYes, I returned even after the aforementioned experience, thinking it must be a fluke.\n\nSo...yesterday we went and AGAIN were treated rudely, by guess what? The SAME GUY. This time he was bagging the groceries and did such a poor job that my husband had to stop and re-do it himself on our way out. He was in such a rush that he couldn't bag our groceries properly.\n\nIt's too bad. Please fire this man. (Curly, blonde hair). He is terrible and gives Whole Foods a bad name. I will be going to the new one on Camelback from now on.",0
I ONLY shop at whole foods but this location is the worst of the 4 locations that I've been to in the valley. It might be the oldest so the layout and even selection seems to be outdated. I rather go to the location on mayo or even better go out of my way to the new location in camelback.,0
"I LOVE Whole Foods as a company, but this has got to be one of the worst locations in AZ. Maybe I'm spoiled with the shelf space and layout of the one on Mayo in Scottsdale (a flagship store built in 2008), but this Shea store is about a third of the size, if that. EVERY time I have gone there (it's much closer to me than the Mayo location), they NEVER have what I need. Whether it's a type of hummus, cosmetic, vitamin, flax oil, it's never there like it is on Mayo. They just don't have the shelf space.\n\nToday, I tried one more time for Barlean's flax oil. Oh, they had it, but the 16oz sizes had been sitting on the shelf since November (it says on the bottles when they are created) and due to expire in one month. Shows how little product they move. They just don't have the customer turnover. I looked for a hummus they had at the Mayo location and they didn't carry that either. When I asked about the brand, they tried to sell me something else that I didn't want. Weak. \n\nMy other major complaint and apparently it is a common one according to the staff, is that they have a HUGE display of bath salts (open) and soaps sitting out near all the food smack in the middle of the store. If you want flax oil, you'd better be good at holding your breath. It was so strong that just from walking through the area once, my boyfriend asked me \""""what is that smell, it smells like cheap perfume soap or something\"""" on me when I got home. Wow. It's really bad for anyone with perfume sensitivities which is a lot of people in AZ, one of the worst allergy zones in the country. \n\nI mean, Whole Foods is supposed to be a mecca of health, not stench and inconvenience. \n\nThis long-time customer will be exclusively shopping (and dropping lots of cash) at Mayo from now on. I'm tired of wasting my time and breathing the fumes at Shea.",0
I love this store. I have only been to 2 or 3 so I am not a good judge of one being better that the other. It's clean and the variety is amazing.  I stroll thru the entire store and look at everything before I decide what I need. I always pick out a sushi roll and it's usually the albacore variety.  The sushi is always fresh and tasty. I have also tried the soups and they are amazing too. It's definitely a safe bet if you are out and about and need a healthy and fresh snack or meal.,1
"I bought a smoothie and a different price came up at the register than the sign and also the $1 promotion was not showing up. Juliana was my cashier and instead of helping me she rolled her eyes and laughed at me. Only after I had to press the issue was she willing to call the bakery to confirm the price. When bakery called her back she said, \""""I'm not even going to answer them\"""" and proceeded to help the person next in line!\n\nI was just standing there waiting to be acknowledged. It was like I was a burden to her just cause I wanted her to do her job!\n\nI shop at whole foods a couple of times a day (coffee in the morning, usually get a smoothie for lunch and my regular groceries) and only had a positive experience. I'm such a whole food fan and this seem so out of place with the whole foods that I experienced in the past. Hope you can resolve this issue ASAP!\n\n\n***i heard from several including an employee friend of mine that after I left Juliana and her coworker Mikelyn Sierra were mocking me and laughing at me.",0
3/5/11: we met some other families here for our first visit. Separate play area for under 2 years made it a lot easier for me to relax & enjoy watching my son play on his own & with other little ones. We will be back. :),1
"Very disappointing. After reading the great reviews posted by others, I purchased a groupon for 5 visits. Needless to say, I will not be making a trip back. The idea is nice, but the construction of the little town is very poor and in need of a face lift and new carpeting. It was packed with kids, but there seemed to be very few toys in site. My daughter went to play in the little grocery store, but instead of baskets of fun fake food, there was nothing in there but a broken plastic cash register. Everything looked worn and dingy and we left after about fifteen minutes.",0
"I came here yesterday with my buddy K (17 months) and I must say it have definitely improved. I hadn't been here in maybe a year. Back then it was just ok and something/someplace to take kids when it got super hot. I believe there are new owner and the improvements are noticeable and appreciated. There is no longer a center \""""cage\"""" for the under 2's, but a nice little space off to the side. It opens up the space for lots of running around and using the riding toys. There is a lot more seating for the grown ups. There is new carpet and a way cool slide. Downsides, It's still a small place, they have raised the admission price to $9/kid, and I didn't see a discount if you have more then one child.",1
"We are back from a disappointing trip to Imagination Avenue.  I was frankly appalled at the condition of this facility and the toys within.  Everything looked old, dirty, and used.  Every room we went into had little to no toys in it, and everything seemed to be missing parts and pieces.  Everywhere I looked, I saw chipped paint, and old/broken toys.  We went into the coloring/puzzle room and tried to do two puzzles, and both were missing pieces.  We went into the \""""Home Depot\"""" area and wanted to use a screwdriver, but couldn't find any screws.  We went into the home/kitchen area, and there was nothing there but a broken play popcorn machine - no plates or utensils, no food, nothing!  The \""""washing machine\"""" (which had a broken knob) did have some play clothes in it, but they were old and dingy just like everything else in the building.\n\nThe facility was also surprisingly small.  There is only one room that contains all the little pretend buildings, and one smaller room for coloring/puzzles/books that I believe they also use for private parties.  It gets crowded in no time, and there is minimal seating for parents.  I felt like I was in the way the whole time because with nowhere to sit, I sort of stood and lingered in the play area getting run into by shopping carts and cars. \n\n I cannot believe anyone regularly pays the exorbitant $9 admission fee, when the Children's Museum of Phoenix is $11, and even Playgrounds Fun Zone is $8 (and much cleaner and newer).",0
"My 2 year old daughter absolutely LOVES Imagination Avenue! We've been here 3 times with our moms group and it always provides hours of hassle-free fun for all ages. \n\nIf you haven't been in the last 6-8 months since the new owners took over, GO BACK. They have completely refreshed the place. It has all new carpet, a designated baby area, more parent seating and rad a slide. It's much more open and clean. They're also working on more renovations including a new cafe which will serve healthy foods for parents and kids.\n\nWhen we meet with friends, it's always nice to be able to chat without chasing after the little ones. Imagination avenue provides a safe, fun environment for everyone!",1
"Finding activities for our toddler during the crazy AZ heat is challenging... you can only swim, do the splash pads, museums, etc so many times... So when my friend Jane suggested a playdate for our boys over the weekend at Imagination Avenue, I was excited to check it out. \n\nAdmittedly, I'd been once before, but it was over two years ago (before I became a mom), so I didn't really remember it or pay close attention to detail the first time I was there.\n\nImagination Avenue is simply put, a huge playroom for kids... there is something for everyone too.  Themed rooms such as a firestation, grocery store, bakery, etc... and all kinds of toys like strollers with babies, lawn mowers, cars, kitchen stuff, and more will keep your kid entertained for your entire visit.  They have a big slide that my son loved, and they also pull out crafts at certain times. \n\nImagination Avenue is currently remodeling a cafe and reception area, which is great as I think they could use a bit of a facelift!  But even as is, I'm a big fan.  Your visit will likely be worth every cent of the $9 admission price you'll spend to play here... and if you really like it, you can do a membership for just $120 unlimited annually or $65 for ten visits.",1
"This place is super chaotic, my little boy who is 2, kept getting trampled by older more rambunctious kids, whose parents weren't paying attention.\n\nAlso, I don't get what's so great about this place.  It's dirty, crazy and nothing very interesting.  I washed my kids hands stat after being here.  I much prefer Playtime Oasis or The Children's Museum.",0
"Just the right size to keep your eye on the kids, I love the little houses with all the themes as did my kids 6 & 2 years old. There was enough to keep them both entertained. They can't wait to go back!",1
"Value of the Spa Pedicure is awful.  They sell it as the \""""most relaxing\"""" and that they massage and use special scrubs \""""from the knee down\"""" - they do not.  My \""""massage\"""", which I could barely feel went just slightly above my ankle.  The actual exfoliating part of the pedicure barely happened - I need to find ANOTHER place to do the job they didn't do.  I paid $52 (incl. $8 tip) and feel completely ripped off.  Oh, and the top coat they use, is NOT a fast dry top coat like every other salon I've ever been to.  Result?  Messed up polish on 4 of my toes.  Not happy at all.",0
"I just 'droided myself and I'm not ashamed to admit it:)\n\nI got my first cellular telephone in 1985...it took the better part of a day to install in my car, had a total weight of nearly 30 lb's and had to be bought as a separate item and then matched to the cellular provider (in this case McCaw Communications, the predecessor of CellularOne and ATT).\n\nIt cost more than $1,000 and that cost was surprisingly low compared to the Motorola \""""banana\"""" phone I got a year later (a \""""pocket phone\"""" if you had pockets that could accommodate a 3 lb., 12\"""" x 5\"""" phone:)\n\nIt was wonderful...I could talk and do business whether I was in my car, on my boat, out skiing or playing golf, in another city (all I had to do was pack my charger and spare battery...another 10 -12 pounds:)\n\nI stayed with ATT until 2007 when my patience with poor signal and poor service finally ran out...that's right 22 years of patience...I'm like a camel of patience, apparently:)\n\nI switched to Verizon and have never looked back:)\n\nThe first set of phones were state of the art a couple of years ago and the Beautiful Carin and I were very happy with them (in fact, my girl is now the queen...or maybe the crown princess...of texting...so fast! :)\n\nCoverage was and is excellent (3G everywhere:)\n\nIt was time for my \""""new every 2\"""" upgrade from Verizon, and I 'droided myself and Carin...no I didn't get any on anyone else:)\n\nMy kids all have iPhone's (and they think they are so much cooler than the old man), but I may have the last laugh...25,000 'droid apps and growning (all but a couple of dozen are free:)...much better coverage than ATT, access to all that crazy google stuff (even Doc's,  Voice and Wave work on the 'droid:)\n\nConstant updates (I just got a text that Verizon will update the eris 'droid to android 2.0 in January:), and knowledgeable, organized and pleasant people whenever I go into one of their stores for accessories and what have you:)\n\nService was excellent, the upgrade was dead easy, and the phones were free...yup...free, and you know how I like a free 'droiding :-)",1
"Sold me the world's worst phone without telling me the Droid was comming out in 2 weeks. Stuck with a Samsung SEGA for another 6 months. Does all tech stuff great. Sucks as a phone. Can't hear, drops calls repeatedly, (could be Verizon's Network too). I can't wait to get rid of it and possible Verizon too.",0
"I've been a customer for over 5 years and feel Verizon has a long way to go when it comes to customer service. I hate to give anyone a bad review but after the problems I've had at that store and the amount of time I had to spend to correct them, I have to pass it along.\nHad a Blackberry that was replaced 4 times in 6 months. RIM told me the design was problematic and they were telling people to get a replacement with a newer model. Not naming names but I had one girl tell me my phone wasn't broken and to \""""come back when it's really broken\"""" then another gave me completely incorrect information and that's just on 2 of 46 visits I made regarding that phone.\nI finally had to file a complaint with the FCC for fraud because I was paying for service on a phone that didn't work. It was then that I was contacted by a corporate rep. They have an entirely different attitude and capability working with people. In the store I have been treated so poorly that I refuse to step foot in there ever again. I have found the same problem at other stores. No one seems to know how to work with the public or how to actually resolve a problem for a customer.\nIt's too bad these employees aren't properly trained or perhaps don't care and because of that I will not renew my Verizon contract when it's up. Even if they have the best network, it's not worth being treated like garbage when you're paying an arm and leg for service.",0
"I just received my third HTC phone from Verizon.  The first one (new, supposedly) quit in about two weeks, the second one lasted about 4 months and wasn't even programmed to talk to cell towers., I had to do myself while a rep walked me through this very technical procedure. As for third phone, I called a rep and they directed me to a store, so I went to this store.  The sales rep, an older man, was very patronizing, and said he would order replacement which I would receive the next day. That did not happen and when I called Verizon, I found that he had never placed the order. The order was placed with the Verizon phone rep and did get today.  I pleaded with them to be able to change to a different brand, but was told that couldn't happen. The store manager was very rude when I tried to explain re the phone not being ordered and his attitude made me realize just how little individual customers mean to Corporate America.  Anyway, here I am on my third phone in six months.  Wonder how long this one will last?",0
"The customer service at this place is awful. I waited for 15 minutes before I was put on a waiting list to wait even longer. Then on the waiting list, I waited for another 30 minutes... TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!",0
"They're lucky to get one star. Rude, terrible customer service. Wanted nothing to do with me since all I needed was a phone case. Probably could have upgraded my phone. Camelback location here I come.",0
I wish I could give zero stars. The customer service here is horrendous. I've been in this location on two separate occasions and had questions just tossed to the side. First I tried to see if there was anyway to get a replacement phone due to a shattered screen and was dismissed.  On the second occasion I went in to ask about the new edge program and how I could sign up. The woman (blonde) just gave me some lame excuse about my renewal being too close not allowing eligibility. Two months I'd have to wait with a tough luck attitude she sent me on my way. Bullshit. Went home and signed up for the program and had a new phone sent to me within an hour. She was just lazy. I was willing to shell out cash on the spot in both situations. I will never return to this location and I urge you to find another.,0
"So unhappy with my experience at this store. LOVE my new GS5 and my coverage has been perfect, but I would recommend avoiding this store.  The day we went to shop we spent at least 45 minutes waiting- not a big deal. They were busy, I get it.  When we finally saw a rep he was very sales-y and kind of pushy. I just told you I'm here for a new plan and phone.... you don't have to sell me. \n\nAnyway, he tells us about a current regional promotion where we would receive a free 1gb of data for the entire contract length as long as we ported in a local number. Perfect, I wanted to anyway.  After another hour of him fumbling to get the phones set up and numbers ported in we were finally on our way.  \n\nThe next day we notice on our phones that our plan says we only have 1gb of data. We call Verizon and they explain that the promotion doesn't start until the second month. Again, not that big of a deal, but pretty annoying that he didn't find that necessary to tell us.\n\nWell, a couple of days ago our second month starts and what do you know, we still only have 1gb!  After speaking with Verizon on the phone they told us the promotion actually started 5 days after we started our plan and the employee just told us about it early. They assured us it shouldn't be a problem, just to go to the store and have it sorted it.\n\nOnce at the store my boyfriend received terrible customer service.  He spoke with the manager and she was completely inflexible and unapologetic. I'm sorry, but if your employee is giving the wrong information you need to do the right thing and honor it. \n\nIf we had known it wasn't starting yet we could have simply waited a couple of days to start our contract.  Now we are stuck in contract for two years with different terms than we thought we were agreeing to with a company that doesn't honor their promises.",0
"Walked in to get a new FREE tablet that was advertised on internet...got my bill of $187.55...normally my bill is $75.00..I called NICK the manager to have him explain..my bill shows a $49.00 charge...yes I bought accessories totaling $56.22\nmy bill should be $131.22....yes they CHARGED me for a free tablet!! What a rip off...BAIT and SWITCH!!   These phone companies should be held responsible for all added fees. When I called Verizon direct I spoke to 3 supervisors for over an hour and they too could not figure it out and told me to call store...\n I love the coverage of VERIZON, but service is horrible....and cheat their customers. My plan is the same as a friend has and she pays $49.00 a month...why all the differences. The longer you stay with a company it should be cheaper...SHE'S a NEW customer..VERY UNHAPPY!!!!\nBUYER BEWARE!!!\nIf I could give a ZERO rating I would.",0
"LIED LIED LIED LIED.  went in to upgrade my wife's phone and was told about the Verizon tablet and it being on special and being only $10 a month.  I and my wife both asked what the extra charges would be, activation, data etc.  We were both told no other fees would be charged at all.  \n\nTen days later we got a bill in the mail for activation fees and many other things to include a new line service and data package for this new tablet.  Called customer service and got the run around and was told I would get a call back never did.  Called again and was told a supervisor would call within 48 hours, nothing.  Called a 3rd time and finally got someone that gives a crap, turns out the store opened a WHOLE NEW SUB-ACCOUNT this new sub account was already at 200 additional dollars owed on top of what my 'main' account was.  \n\nSo breaking this down the man at this store lied bold faced, then opened a hidden account ( I had no access to this account on my verizonwireless.com account) and added all kinds of things to the account that I did not ask to have.  My only guess is that they get a commission of some sort and that he was padding his for the month.  After i fixed all this with the 3rd and finally smart customer service lady I returned to the store.  Eric the manage was at the door he started listening then shut me down and sent me to someone else that I had to start explaining it all to again.  They seemed concerned and claimed the guy no longer worked there but....liars are gonna lie.  I have a hard time believing what I was told on this final trip.",0
Horrible customer service. They seem to not understand the concept of a customer service desk for simple returns and exchanges and non-accounts related questions. All it takes is one customer service rep to be dedicated for minor small issues. The rest of the longer process questions can go through the normal process but find a way to get the quick ones out faster. This is just common sense waiting an hour in order to process a minute exchange was ridiculous.,0
"Hands down, one of the best shopping experiences I have had - and I am comparing to all of them, not just fish.\n\nI was seeking a brand new, custom tank. I shopped around but Aquatouch had a good price and, more importantly, the best service. From start to finish, everything was covered - tank and stand. All of my questions were answered (and I had a lot!). I just got the tank this week and it's beautiful! I am still getting follow-up support on setting up the tank.\n\nI want to note something very important - I always felt like I was dealing with honest people.\n\nThe store itself is clean and neat. They focus more on saltwater than fresh. I'm not a saltwater expert but I would say their selection is good. The saltwater fish are all active and appear \""""happy\"""" to me. The planted  freshwater tanks are beautiful. I think they specialize in more of the high end freshwater fish and plants.\n\nThis store will remain tops on my list. If you are going to make that huge investment in a large tank, I would just go to Aquatouch. I already did the research for you. You'll get great service, good prices and have all your questions answered.",1
This shop seems to have changed hands. I have been going here for years and recently lost many fish because the fish I purchased here had ich. I went back to the shop only to discover their fish had visible signs of ich but were still being sold as healthy.,0
I like the quality over quantity approach. The tanks are nicely set up and clean. My fish are doing well other than a few missing scales from being taken from the display tank. Ive noticed they still sell deformed fish at full price though. One day I went in and it took over 20 minutes to get a simple yes or no question answered. The customer service was so bad I give them a 1 star review despite the quality. I won't be coming back.,0
"Stopped in to check out the store for the first time, and was extremely impressed. All of the display aquariums were spotless and esthetically pleasing to the eye. Staff was very friendly and available for help. The selection of livestock was large, very health, and well maintained! Entirely an excellent experience!",1
"Overpriced and slow service. Great selections in freshwater but go online if you can, it will save you time and money",0
"You may take this with a grain of salt, as this is simply my opinion.\n\nHowever, I am unimpressed with a store whose employees allow you enter with nary a greeting. And most of them were gathered by the front counter. Furthermore, they allow you to wander for nearly 30 minutes without even asking if you need any assistance.\n\nHonestly, I drove 30+ miles to go to what is purported to be the aquatic animal store that has the largest selection only to experience a dreadful customer service experience?\n\nYes, I will give them kudos for the fact that their store is large, clean, and has a very large selection of product. But, if I can't even get any help with said product, what's the point?\n\nNevertheless, I drove 48+ miles to visit a competitor, and had a wonderful experience in a smaller store. They got my dollars, and it was worth the drive.\n\nThen to top it all off, the same employees allowed us to leave without even saying anything. I hope that whatever topic of conversation they were having was so important that it took precedence over paying customers.\n\nI hope that they do improve their customer service in the future.\n\nHowever, I will not be returning, regardless of how large of an aquarium I get for our future homes.",0
"AquaTouch is a cool place to visit. But most of the products are overpriced. For example if you want to buy a pack of 9L ADA Aquasoil, it will be $53 a pack as of today. But if you get it online, it will only be $30 plus shipping, which is about $10 cheaper\n\nAlso, the past couple times I went in to buy things, I felt so unwelcome because I was with my toddler son. Staffs will greet everybody else in the shop or those who walk in after us but my son and I, we were like invisible to them, and I didn't get any help until after I stood in front of the counter for 10 minutes. Seriously, they think every one who walks in with kids will be a irresponsible parent to let the kids run around the shop on his or her own and destroy everything. \n\nI really hope that they will improve their customer service in the future.",0
They just lost my money cause no one would ask if I needed help. Waste of my time.,0
"This place used to be the go to place in AZ even with their higher prices.\n\nThe last two years have been bad for them. Employees that don't help and the ones that do flat out lie to your face.\n\nI was in the store to trade some SPS corals. Some frags where choice (cali tort full color 2-3 inches) other not so much but still nice (faded tri color acros resembling Garf Bonsai 3-5 inches faded from being under the colony but with bright tips and full flesh) and a very nice colony of Chong Bong Zoa (50+ heads).\n\nI was told the time before this that they were trying to get into more natural color corals (brown and tan). This time they didn't take any of my SPS because (from the same employee)\n\nStore: \""""we are moving away from SPS unless they have bright color\"""".\nBut didn't they say they were moving away from un-natural color coral last time I was in\n\nMe: Umm, \""""Did you see the Cali Tort frags (full bright color)?\"""" \n\nStore: \""""Yes but we aren't going to take them.\"""" \""""We will take the zoa \nthough.\""""\n \nMe: \""""No, I'll just take everything home.\""""\n\nStore: \""""We'll take zoa.\""""\nI think the kid wanted to frag some for himself\n\nMe: \""""No, I'll take everything home!\"""" Why would I wanna give you a $5 per zoa piece that has 50 heads on it for $20? If you would take all the corals I brought today for $60-80 then I would say ok!\""""\n\nThey Lost A Customer",0
"I'm very new to PHX. I ended up talking to a cop at the airport who told me about Thursday Rockabilly nights at the Blooze. I had to check it out. My friend and I walked in and were instantly comfortable, excited, and impressed. The AC was pumping, beer was cold, the music; rockin, and the crowd; refreshing. The bathroom was great! \nThey don't have food there but they will let you bring in whatever you want. We went there pretty early, around 7:30ish. Unfortunately, because of ridiculously early work on Fri AM, I had to leave once it was starting to get really packed and lively around 10:30/11. I am so glad that I finally checked the place out though. I will definitely frequent The Blooze as often as I can.",1
"The Blooze is a dive bar by categorization only. It is much too clean, organized, and well lit to actually meet dive bar standards. A classy dive bar, if you will. \n\nI went to see The Limit CLub play for Thursday Rockabilly Night, and the stage set up is fantastic! It has the whole lights/sound set up down perfectly. There are two 27 inch monitors mounted on either end of the stage so that people sitting in the back of the bar can see what's going on, and the checkerboard dance-floor is a nice touch! \n\nDrinks are cheap if you like domestic beer or well drinks. And the bathrooms are super clean if your bladder isn't up to binge drinking! The ladies room even has pictures of 1980s hotties plastered all over the inside of the stalls. \n\nOverall, this is a great little bar to see a local band and have a cheap drink. Just beware of the scary bikers that seem to perpetually hang out in front of places like this!",1
"My husband came with me to do laundry once.  The laundromat is in the same area and of course while I was doing that, he hung out at The Blooze.  I would go over in between loads.  There was only one person working in the front of house.  She was really nice.  She didn't lose her cool at all when more people started coming in.  She handled it well.  Especially when a regular at the bar was giving her a hard time.  She just went with the flow and eventually he left.  They have 2 pool tables, darts and a stage for a band on the weekends.  If you are already there when the band is setting up, you just get a stamp and don't have to pay cover, which is awesome.  We ended up leaving before the band came on, but we plan on going back soon.  It is a little bit of a dive, but everyone there was friendly.  And they don't serve food, so eat before hand, but the drinks are cheap.",1
One word. Three letters: FUN!\n\nGreat local spot for live music that has you dancing in your seat... or go ahead and shoot some pool! Cheap drink prices.,1
"I might have gone on a bad night, as it was Heavy metal night. The Blooze was very scary to me. It was a total biker bar to me. Everyone in black, smoking, tatooes and piercings everywhere. I was literally scared to go in. \n\nThe rest of my group finally showed up and went in. It's a small bar with no table serve for drinks. I don't believe they had any food. \n\nIf you like the biker atmosphere this is a place for you.",0
Totally fun place. Went with a meet up group. The crowd was easy going and obviously lots of local regulars.,1
"This is a great local neighborhood bar. Depending on the night you never know what kind of crowd you're going to get. Sometimes it's biker night other times it appears to be redneck rebel night and still others you have swing dancing so you see all your rockabilly kids-- lots of big hair and bigger skirts. No matter what the crowd everyone here is always friendly. There's no reason to be intimidated by people's looks. The beer selection is outstanding! It is not what you would expect from a local 'dive bar'. Prices are pretty good on their import beer which I like and appreciate. The bathroom is always sparkling clean which you can rarely say about any bar. Staff is super friendly and helpful but you gotta go to the bar to get your drinks which I'm okay with. My only serious issue with this place is the sound system. Been to a bunch of shows and sometimes the sound is good, sometimes it sounds bad. Not sure if it's the soundboard or the operator that's to blame for this but you can definitely tell sound quality difference between shows.",1
Saturday night. Looking forward to this show and we got here before 8pm. Show started near 930. So freaking crowded you can't see the band.  Its so loud you cant hear the band.  Fire Marshall bill would close the place. So over capacity you can't move. Let alone get to the bathroom. All about greed. Need to stop ticket sales while there is still room to move.,0
"This is the perfect neighborhood bar. I've been here almost every day of the week, and there is always something going on. Between the multiple TVs and the huge projection screen for sports events, to dance lessons, and plenty of live music all week you can get your fill in more ways than one at this bar. \n\nThey get nationally and world famous touring bands, and of course our favorite local bands to play, always keeping it entertaining. Every Thursday night is rockabilly night, if you've never been for this music it's a true treat with pinups, greasers, cars, motorcycles, swing dancers, and of course an amazing band to tap your feet to, all with no cover! This is the highlight of my week, but they also offer a wide variety of different musicians from rock, to metal, country, blues, and some great cover bands as well!\n\nThe bartenders are hard to ignore here. They will pour your drink strong and fast, with fire and grace. They also have one of the best bar backs I've ever seen. If something breaks he's there in a split second, and watch out for him carrying around about 15 glasses stacked at a time. It's always clean, even the restrooms! Which says A LOT about this \""""dive\"""" bar.\n\nIf you're in the area don't skip out on going to The Blooze. There's sure to be something going on, and hey, if all is quiet, just have some drinks and play some pool or darts.",1
"This bar is white trash. They over charged us but we tipped them$5 anyway just to take the high road. Then the weird looking bartender with the shaved head, Jen and the crazy looking one with fake...everything, suzi started yelling that we didn't tip the enough. They even had their ugly little mountain man posse follow us out to our car. My husband warned the guys to leave and told them if they tried to attack us he would defend us ...and that he did! A bunch of weirdos and complete morons.",0
The only thing good about the open jam tonight was the bartender hot hot hot!!! \nWill not be going back!,0
"I went to Desert Valley to get an Upper GI screen. I got lost on the way (dang google maps), I called and the receptionist gave me great directions. \n\nThe test itself is pretty gross, you have to drink Barium and roll around like a guinea pig while they xray your stomach. The nurse and the xray tech were both really nice and friendly and explained everything along the way. \n\nIf you find yourself in a situation where you have to get a GI screen, I would recommend Desert Valley. The staff was polite and professional and made me an uncomfortable experience almost pleasant.",1
My boyfriend was in extreme pain and the customer service was atrocious. The front desk women had passive aggressive attitudes and not only did we wait an hour and a half because they messed up his insurance billing but he missed his doctors appointment. Plus they didn't even give him his paperwork to fill out until we called the doctors ourselves to get the correct information which took half the time it did for them. Very unorganized and not recommended if you have any other plans for the day or want to be heard.,0
"I love this place..... cheap quality chinese food... everything i've had there is good. When they label an item as spicy, it is actually spicy! \n\n\nThere lunch specials are an awesome deal. 5 or 6 bucks for a plate of food, soup and fried wonton chips.\n\nlove it!",1
"My family and I have been eating here for at least the last decade. We always order the \""""house special dinner.\"""" This includes soup, egg rolls, chicken wings and several entrees depending on the size of your group. I can't speak for the other dishes but the ones we get with this are always superb. The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside but I would recommend this place to anyone.",1
Had this last night for dinner. It was pretty good! The rice was nice and fluffy unlike some places you get slightly hard rice from it being overcooked or old. I live right next door so I look forward to becoming a repeat customer. Only thing is that no one delivers around here!,1
"I really don't know how this place has such great reviews. I walked in on Friday night to order takeout. I waited at the bar/counter area for about 10 minutes with maybe 5 other people all waiting to order take out or pick up. It seemed very chaotic for the one woman behind the counter taking orders, fetching them, and ringing them out. It looked like she was even serving on the floor at times. The food took about 20-25 minutes once my order was placed. Prices were okay, but the food wasn't anything to write home about. I got Hot & Sour Soup (nice and spicy) and Mongolian Beef (a weird light brown color...).\n\nAs for ambiance, it definitely has that feel of chinese restaurants from the 90's.",0
I love this hole in the wall place!!!!!!! Their sizzling rice soup is amazing! But be sure to get $2 extra rice with it.,1
As an east coaster looking for an equal to Chinese food back in Boston this place is the best I've found so far. \nThe service is slow and awkward but the food is good. The sauce that comes on the BBQ pork is out of this world. If you're an east coaster searching for duck sauce this is a great substitute. \nI'd give 5 stars but it's not Boston Chinese food.,1
"They have all the typical chinese/American dishes.  Great service.  It's my go to when I have a craving for chinese food.  Love the generals beef, house lo mien, house special chicken and my son loves the Mongolian beef.  Staff is really friendly, as well.",1
"I really enjoy coming here for the lunch specials. My two favorites are the house special chicken, and the twice cooked chicken, very tasty. This spot might be overlooked but I am glad I gave Little Peking a chance. I have been coming back frequently for the great food.",1
"Do yourself a favor and drive 1/4 mi down 32nd and go eat at Sala Thai, you'll thank me. \n\nSo the story starts about a year ago I ordered takeout. It was over cooked, dry and barely edible. Pretty much threw it out. That was my first experience, should have learned my lesson.\n\nSo I gave it a second chance this New Years 2014. I figured they will be busy, so a good chance the food will be fresh and hot. So I called, ordered my food and the woman on the phone said 45min, then before I hung up said better make that an hour. I had no problem with that, it was New Years. So I showed up pretty much an hour after I called. As I entered I noticed no one was at the counter, so I waited a few minutes. A woman comes out from the back with a cart to clear and clean tables. Walks to the table right next to me and just looks at me and smiles and goes about clearing the table. Mind you, no one was waiting for a table. About halfway thru clearing the table she asks me if I'm here to pick up food, i said yes. She said OK, and went back to clearing and cleaning the table. She finishes the 1 table, and then proceeds to go clear and clean a second table, still no one waiting for a table. \n\nShe finishes the second table and pushes the cart full of dishes to the back, talks to some other waitress and then pushes the cart back into the kitchen and disappears. So I've been standing at the counter for close to 15min at this point. By the way, the restaurant had maybe 7 tables with people. Not slammed, and still no one waiting for a table.\n\nNow there are 4 people waiting for take out, finally they start paying attention to us. I finally get my food, 1h 25m after I ordered.\n\nI head back to the house(1mi away) and we sit down to eat. We ordered Generals Chicken, Mu Shu Pork, pot stickers.\n\nThe chicken was dry, with very little sauce. Basically didn't eat it.\n\nThe Mu Shu was greasy, lacked flavor. Ate about half of it.\n\nThe dumplings are clearly pre-made, so they are greasy, the dough is undercooked, and meat is unrecognizable paste. Ate about half of the order.\n\nI believe based on some of the reviews this place may have had good food, but the owners are older and have lost the drive to make great food. They are clearly buying pre-made food and just reheating it, or cooking it. You can tell they don't really make anything fresh any longer. \n\nI will NEVER eat here again, and will tell anyone who will listen to avoid this restaurant at all costs.",0
"Pick Up Stix is another \""""fast\"""" Chinese restaurant.  Not as fast as a Panda Express, but more like a Pei Wei with a more casual atmosphere.  The give very generous portions, with lots of veggies.  I frequently order sweet and sour chicken at any Chinese restaurant, and this was one of the best.",1
Been closed for quite some time.,1
Don't go here if your hungry!,0
"I have been going to this dermatologist's office for years. However, as long as I've gone there, I haven't ever been completely happy with the experience. It just seemed easier not to deal with the hassle of dealing with switching, until today. \n\nI called and asked the woman at the front desk if there were any available appointments in the next couple days. She made the hugest sigh I have ever heard and said, \""""Well, uh, um, we don't even have any physicians in the office until I don't know when.\"""" She said this is a really rude manner like I was bothering her. Then I asked, \""""Well, I normally just see one of the physician's assitants, can I get in with them?\""""  She says , \""""(scoffs again) No. No one is in the office. What is it exactly that you need?\""""  I said, \""""I just need an appointment! I need a prescription refilled and somone to look at my skin!\"""" She then RUDELY told me that nothing was available until the end of August. I just said thanks anyway and she hung up. She really made me feel like I was out of line for asking for an appointment at all!\n\nThis is only one of my rude encounters with the ladys at the front desk at this place. One time I got yelled at for quietly talking on my phone in the waiting room. Also, I got two moles removed here by physician's assitants, only to later find out later by the doctor that it should never have been allowed. PS~ The moles ended up taking WAY longer than normal to heal, and have awful scars that are way worse than the moles were themselves. \n\nDON'T GO HERE!",0
"I went and saw the PA Courtney at this office and was pleased with my experience,  There was literally no one in the office when I walked in this morning, which works for me because I cannot stand waiting at the DR office.  \n\nThe office staff were friendly and Courtney was knowledgable and took the time to listen to my concerns.  She also gave me loads of samples and coupon as some of my topical medications can get pricey.\n\nThat said, then I had my husband come here for a mole check and I wish I hadn't! He has two super large scars from where she removed the moles--it looks hacked :(  I feel terrible and to top it off, we got several bills totalling over $200...I understand insurance doesn't cover everything, but we should have been given an  FYI and the chance to get a second opinion...everyhting ended up being totally fine, so was there really concern?????  I am not returning.",0
"I saw Courtney this afternoon for botox.  I've been getting botox on a regular basis for about 10 years & have never had an experience like this.  The ENTIRE appointment lasted about 6 minutes!  With the proper consultation, botox appointments typically last about 30 minutes.  \n1.) She did not discuss ANYTHING with me (other than to not exercise for 4 hours after the treatment)\n2.) She did not have me make facial expressions to determine where to put the product (EVERY Dr./nurse makes you do this, EVERY time)\n3.) She did not ask me one single question about what my concerns were\nShe basically came in, plunged the botox into my face, and said \""""ok, you're all set\"""".  I was shocked and literally speechless & will never step foot into this establishment again.",0
"I agree with the other reviewers. I came in for a mole check and they ended up removing 3 moles  They didn't inform me how much it would be to remove them. I told her my insurance isn't great and I was worried about the cost. I ended up paying almost $1,000 for everything which is ridiculous and now have three ugly scars. I've been going to  dermatologists for years and this is the first dr who removed this many moles. It's definitely about getting your $ at this place.",0
This doctor and his staff rocks! I have severe dentist anxiety and they did everything to make my experience anxiety free and comfortable! Thank you to Dr. Ingersoll and your amazing staff! :),1
"The office space, layout, presentation gets 5 stars, the customer service you receive from the employees at Corporate Office Center is a negative 10. They will scare your clients off, scare your own staff and make your life a living hell. Their office locations and space is beautiful but if a say, a client shows up at a time other than their scheduled time, they will be told to leave. They will be told you don't provide any services at the locations and if anyone could single handedly ruining your professional image, Corporate Office Centers can do this for you! BE AFRAID!!!! They are dedicated to working against, not with you.",0
"I cannot begin to express how poorly I think of Corporate Office Centers. As the reviewer before me stated, the location is ideal and the offices are lovely, but the customer service is atrocious. I had a one-year lease in the office with a number of challenges throughout my term. Unfortunately, my requests for assistance fell on deaf ears. The staff is trained to make money, NOT to help tenants. Below are some examples:\n\nShortly after I moved into the office, I was told that I could not use my AirPort to connect my Mac to my printer and make a wireless environment. That meant that I had to run wires across the office and inconvenience my clients when they visited the office. Apparently, had I paid an additional fee, I could have used my AirPort, which is NOT a router, as specified in my contract and verbally.\n\nThen, when faced with personal and professional financial challenges, I approached the management about moving to a virtual office or finding another solution so I would not have to endure continued financial hardship. Again, I was flatly denied the option to even discuss the situation. \n\nFinally, after ending my lease, I was BILLED! The management requires a substantial deposit, yet I was billed for mail forwarding and cleaning. I had less than $3 worth of mail forwarded to me because I picked up the other pieces. I also never used or publicized the number provided by Corporate Office Centers, as I just forwarded my own number. Therefore, my COC number was not used, even though I still received a $375 fee. And cleaning a 125-square-foot office for $325? I have had my entire 1,300-square-foot home professionally cleaned for little more than that. That amount is ridiculous, especially since I cleaned all surfaces before vacating.\n\nI will vehemently discourage others from using Corporate Office Centers as they are a complete rip-off. I have heard this tale of woe from others who were lured in and are now stuck. If you need an office space, do yourself a favor and avoid COC. It will only cost you if you go this route.",0
"I have a son and a daughter who have attended Community Montessori School for the last 14 months. It is a one room school house with 4 teachers and less than 30 children. There is a teacher for the outside activities, and 3 that stay inside. The school is clean and orderly. The children eat a home packed lunch outside (weather permitting) provided by the parent. There is an emphasis on proper nutrition and appropriate lessons given on this topic. Parents are expected to donate  fresh fruit/veggies/ juice/etc,  and if your still naps, you will be given school laundry duty approx every 6 weeks.  The tuition for the private school is a little higher than other private schools in the area once all the extra fees are factored in. The reason for the low rating is because of the issues my family encountered due to the head teacher authoritative attitude and inflexible demeanor. There are two very good teachers (Jocelyn and Helen) at this school, however the attitude of the boss typically sets the tone and environment of any workplace and that is absolutely the case for this one room school house. \n \nThe school is academically strong. My children learned a lot at their time at the school.  They often came home talking about their day, their friends, and the new lessons they learned. I also made it a point to reach out to the teachers and ask how the kids were doing frequently. We always received feedback. When there were struggles the teachers were always willing to discuss and provide alternatives.  My experience was, as long as we took the advice from the head teacher, then things were ok, but if we did not conform, then it was her way or the highway -  there was no flexibility.  For example, after a particularly difficult couple of weeks, when my  children were struggling with proper behavior, the head teacher thought it best to have my son hold her pocket for the entire afternoon. He had to literally hold her pocket,  and could only go where she went, except for bathroom breaks. At this point my son shut down and did not want to engage in learning. I felt the practice of \""""shamming\"""" a  4 year old into compliance was inappropriate.  I would have preferred a more respectful way to discipline him for the behavior.  My husband and I discussed many times with the head teacher, and tried to brainstorm different ways to get my children to think about their behavior. I explained that an un-nurturing attitude would not work with a sensitive 4 year old.  The holding onto a teachers pocket, harsh tones, and taking away a school birthday party for typical 3&4 year old behavior only demonstrates shaming,  and does not respect their feelings, or their struggles to learn the appropriate behavior. We decided to finish out the school year and look for a new private school for the fall.\n \nUpon advising the school that we would  not be attending the summer sessions, or the following year, our children were ignored;  and we were  talked about, by the head teacher,  to other parents behind our back.   I had purposely held off on my online review until the last day of school because I was concerned of backlash. Looks like my instincts were right, as our last 30 days at this school has been marred with hostility.   I believe this behavior to be petty and unprofessional, which is why my rating is a 1 and not higher.  I would not recommend this school based on my experience.",0
"Owner is too bossy and inflexible. She has an \""""I know everything\"""" attitude and tends to be disrespectful to the parents. She offers zero scholarship or any type of financial assistance for preschool, but expects all the parents to do whatever she tells them to do. Her expectations for a 4 year old are often unreasonable and her discipline methods are questionable at best - her favorite way to discipline is to raise her voice to the point of yelling, and she has also yelled at me when I asked her normal questions that a paying customer would have. She doesn't like to be questioned and does not accept any form of constructive criticism. I have met several parents, since I removed my child from this school, who have either removed their children or decided not to send their children to this school due to Janet's overall bossy and disrespectful attitude. I believe that the school year is hard as it is - no need to add stressful situations or people in the mix. There are other Montessori and Chartered schools in this area. I recommend doing your research and making sure you can put up with Janet before you sign your one (or more) year commitment to this school.",0
"Shea Village Lanes ROCKS!  The staff is super nice and the alley is clean.  I mean that is really all you can ask for with bowling alleys.  I have never had the food at this one so I can't comment on that.  But I have used the ladies restroom and it was tidy, big plus in my book.  It's been sort of  updated.  Bowling alleys will always be a bit behind in the modern look but I like it that way to tell you the truth.\n\nShea Village is kinda hidden on the NW corner of Shea & 32nd St.  You won't see the building right away but you will see the sign, so look for that.   And have Fun!",1
"Sorry Annie but I'm docking stars. While the grooming continues to be well done the new cash only policy is frustrating. \n\nThe last time I came to pick up Daisy they told me the debit machine was down. I had no cash and asked if I could pay them next time, they said no and that I could come by anytime before 5 to drop it off. It was an incredible inconvenience and considering it was their fault I couldn't pay they should have let me pay the next time I came in. As previously mentioned I have been bringing Daisy here every week for over a year. It has been about a month now and the debit machine is still \""""down\"""".\n\nThey have lost my business and I will find another place to take the dogs. If they show me no love why should I continue to give them my money!",0
"We have a big old Old English sheepdog.  They did a wonderful job with him-besides looking \""""gorgeous\"""", he was relaxed and seemed to enjoy the experience.  Length of time and price also a plus.",1
i used to love this place when it was a Filibertos years ago. i was actually sitting at the drive thru window when this place was busted my immigration officers about 9 years ago..i was so upset afterwards...it went from a 24 hour food spot to a place that closed at 10pm :(\n\nohh memories. i haven't tried it since it changed to Federico's but lets face it. all these places are pretty much the same. cheap delicious food that is a gamble every single time.,1
"For a cheap ass mexican place, its damned good! Lets face it there are a TON of \""""-bertos\"""" and \""""-icos\"""" ending mexican joints with interchangeable prefixes  but the Federicos on 32nd and Shea is truly one of the good ones. The AZ burritos are awesome as well as the quesadillas - try it with their green sauce and you wont be disappointed! Tostadas arent bad either :)(: one thing, steer clear of adding chicken or steak the quesadillas it ruins them, they get extra fatty/greasy! And hey, open 24 hours? Cant beat that with a stick lol",1
"My Husband and I had lunch today at Federicos, he loves their Fish burritos, they are huge  !  we live in scottsdale, but visit this mexican restaurant often, so worth the drive!   they also have good green chile !  they make their beans with soy, so they do  taste a little different !! this place is very clean also !!   good food ! good prices !",1
"If you are looking for a good burrito you wont find it here. I kept giving this place a chance just by trying other things they had to offer , just because someone says its good don't believe the hype.....!!!!!",0
"I am giving them 4 stars for making the heaviest batch of nachos I have had in a very long time. It was piled high with tons of meet, cheese, guac, sour cream. I was in nacho heaven. Yes I have been to just about every -icos, bertos, etc, but they were very generous on this particular day and I know it. Thank you for helping with my nacho fix. If I am ever in this part of town again, I just may stop in and say hi.. and grab some more nachos!",1
"I've lived in San Diego and had \"""" most likely,\"""" the best burritos in the word. Not to mention making many trips south of the border, the burrito I had was above average.\n  The only down side was towards the end it was a little cold.\n  I suppose being in an area with so much Mexican food could effect the rating, if this place were in South Florida or Hawaii, I'd have to give it five stars. Believe me there aren't any great Mexican restaurants there.",1
"This is my go to place for a late night bite. My usual is the 5 rolled beef tacos with guacamole. They are fried to perfection and always hot. I'm also a big fan of their cheese quesadilla. It's made on a massive flour tortilla, crunchy on the out side and gooey on the inside. \nTheir home made hot sauce is amazing. I always ask for a few extra an toss it in my scrambled eggs the next morning. Federicos is fast, clean, cheap and very tasty. You won't be disappointed!",1
This place is the best absolutely awesome if you drank and partied all night. great for a hangover open 24 hours Connie Asada burrito is the cure for all and will soak up all the alcohol don't forget to get extra salsa,1
"Had my skis waxed/sharpened twice over the past couple months. They did a great job both times. Also bought a new pair of gloves here. While I did find a pair I like, I wish they had a bigger selection of larger-size men's gloves. It took a few minutes to dig out a pair of XLs that I liked. Most of the gloves were in the S to M size range. Looked like they had a good selection of skis/boots/etc... Staff was very friendly and helpful.",1
I get my skis worked on here regularly.  They do a great job and always friendly and helpful.   My buddy bought some boots and took them back a couple times for fitting adjustments (normal when you get good boots) and they worked with him until they were perfect.  Quality shop for sure.,1
"I spoke with the owner Alan today who was able to share his personal experiences and relate those stories to what I am looking for in a ski.  There was no pressure to buy and I am excited to take out a pair of demo skis that are perfect to test out after our discussions.  \n\nI am very happy at this point, once I ride these I will be in a good position to make a decision on which skis I want to buy, I will be buying at Alpine.",1
I have gone here a few times in the past because its the only place around. I have since began just ordering online. The customer service here is terrible and they make you feel really stupid. Avoid it if you can.,0
"PAUL, my hero, my barber.\n\nFor years and years, he has taken care of me with his consistent, immaculate fades.  Why would I ever need to go anywhere else?  Well, I guess when Paul goes on vacation, Max, Tony and Roman are always ready and have all the skills and tools necessary to deliver any kind of cut.\n\nWalk-ins only.  Comfortable and plentiful seating.  Can get REALLY busy at peak times, but worth the wait.  Sports, Spike, or A&E are always on the flatscreen TVs they have mounted over the mirrors.",1
Great barber shop. Went here the first time and will be going back. The shave your neck which is key.,1
I was working in AZ for a couple of weeks and needed a haircut (fade) Tony cleaned me up just as good as my regular barber and for the same price! Looks like I found my AZ barber.,1
"OK-I realize this should not be a surprise.  But, in a stupor of holiday exhaustion, I ordered a Pan-Normous pizza for me and my kids.  My children, apparently already slaves to advertising, REALLY wanted to try it.  It turned out to be a good education for the difference between what something looks like on TV, versus real life.  ( I am sure there is a deep life lesson here, but I was too irritated to take advantage of it)  There was nothing enormous about the pizza, which is my main complaint.  I asked the guy on the phone how many people it would feed, he said 8.  Ummm-8 tiny people.  It was also, not good, but again, not surpised at that.  So I think I will be thankful that now my kids know how gross Pizza Hut is too.",0
"Dear Pizza Hut,  your dough is just horrible please take a page from Dominos and scrap what you're doing and get back in the game.   Tonight's pizza was just a mess.   Half went to the trash.   And that's only because we were so disgusted that we shared it with a less discriminating friend.  I can't believe I actually like this stuff as a kid.   Was it always this bad?  I'd like to think not,  but seriously, just stop it...jokes over.   I'm giving 2-stars only because the employees seemed to be on point and I had no issue there.",0
"For real? My latest experience with this Pizza Hut was almost something to laugh at. \n\nMy boyfriend and I called at around 9:20 for delivery on a Wednesday night. The girl answered the phone, and we stated that this was for delivery. Her first response was that \""""we're on an hour and a half wait for delivery orders.\"""" Really? A primarily delivery-based pizza place is an hour and a half on deliveries? What in the world...? \n\nAnyhow, we changed our minds and stated that it was for pickup. We decided to order one of the specially advertised $8.99 dinner boxes, but she immediately responded that they were out of the boxes. Ok, really? For a nationally recognized chain to be out of an advertised special is a little ridiculous. \n\nSo, thinking that third time would be a charm, we tried to order the cheese lovers pizza (or whatever it's called) and a side of cinnamon sticks. Needless to say, we were turned down again because apparently they are out of \""""all rectangular dough\"""" meaning the rectangular slices to make the garlic toast and the cinnamon sticks. \n\nPizza hut has a mere 4 different things on the menu (excluding variations). HOW ON EARTH CAN YOU BE OUT OF 3/4?! After going nowhere for five minutes, we decided to tell the girl to forget about our order and that we'd consider elsewhere. Just a note to this particular franchise owner, stock enough product and hire enough employees to keep up with demands.",0
If I could rate 0 I would.\nI called at 10:55 to place an order the guy answers and says can u call back when we're open and hangs up.\nI call exactly at 10:59 to place an order I go pick up my I take it back to have lunch this pizza is so salty. I couldn't eat it.,0
"This Bashas is really annoying. Not much for selection and I have often bought expired items. The self check out stations have a goal in life to piss you off and waste your time. \n\nTrying to buy a card? Put it on the scanner and wait, because obviously that card is a fruit of some sort.\n\nIn a hurry? 5 items won't scan and the helper is nowhere in sight.\n\nFeel something dripping down your leg?

"Totally never coming back to this or any bashas store. I had an issue with a very rude employee at this store (who also had a huge chew in his mouth). I called to talk to the manager about it and lo and behold it is the manager with the chew that was rude. So..I go to their website and leave a message in their comment/complaint section. It says that you will receive a response within a couple days. Never got a call back to discuss. So, the final step....a negative yelp review. Sorry Bashas I tried to reach out and you slapped me. Off to Frys from now on!",0
"Great donuts here!! Also Espolon Tequila, both Silver and Gold!!!",1
"I visited this store earlier in the week and bought roast beef from the deli section.  I noticed a plastic container with cheese samples.  As I reached to turn the dome and retrieve a piece, I noticed mildew around the edges of the dome.\n\nWhen I returned home, I was going to make a sandwich.  The roast beef had an odd taste and upset my stomach.  I returned it to the store and told the manager the roast beef was bad and made me sick.  He informed me that he could not understand that, that it takes 36-72 hours for a person to get sick.  He said he had taken a food management course and learned it takes that long to get sick.\n\nI asked if he was the manager of that store, and he said no, that he is the director.",0
"Okay store, they don't offer double coupons, only at face value.  Only come here for eggs and milks.  Surprise that they are still in business!",0
"Hard to get excited about a pharmacy, but this local store is always friendly, well stocked and has a great Redbox in it.\n\nMy kids and I are ALWAYS here for something!",1
"The pictures here (Yelp) don't show the newer Shea location in Scottsdale. Looks like central Phoenix to me.\n\nDined here last night while watching the Spurs wreck the Suns :(\n\nChicken wings are great, the hoagies are amazing, prices are very reasonable, the service is decent. \n\nA great casual place to chow and watch a game.",1
"I grew up in this neighborhood but didn't really discover Uncky Sam's until I was ready to go away to college 35 years ago. I'm 85 years old and my taste buds have over the years been replaced with the desire for the youth I once took for granted. But if there's one culinary recollection that brings a little flutter to this old man's heart it's the phantom taste of a Cheese Hoagie, that phallic masterpiece of untold proportions from Uncle Sam's.\n \nIt's huge. \n\nThey don't let me drive anymore but once in a while I want to jump in a cab and order one for old time's sake with with an extra side of the hoagie dressing. And eat it over the course of six days. It's that good. And that big. The hoagies are cold. The grinders are hot. The ingredients are slightly different for each but good god is this place good. The fountain drinks taste like they are mixed with really gross water but I gladly put up with it because the sandwiches are soooooo good. I've never really ordered anything else and can't speak to the rest of their menu but if you want a really really really good sub try Uncle Sam's.",1
"Memories, pressed between the pages of my mind ... Memories, sweetened thru the ages just like wine...\n\nOh the memories this Uncle Sam's has for me. My entire extended family used to use this as our impromptu reunion spot when I was a wee child.  We still meet up here on occasion for nostalgia's sake.\n\nMy two female cousins used to torture me and I would end up in the bathroom crying every single time. That is until I called my cousin a hooker. Nobody knew what it meant, but it stopped their constant berating so it did the trick.\n\nI cannot imagine a better happy hour. Pitchers of premium beer are $2.99 and their food is like $3. You can get a bud light on draft for $0.75 if you are into that sort of thing.\n\nI always get the cheese hoagie (Cold) with the sweet peppers. Delish. Everything here is good, though, including the pizza, fries, and mozzarella sticks. \n\nThe only reason they don't get a five is because they have horrific service. Sorry, it's true.\n\nCome. Enjoy. Watch Football. Play the Vintage Pacmen Game. Just don't let your cousins torture you for five years.. just call them a hooker from the get go. Trust me, it works.",1
"The only reason I'm not giving Uncle Sam's 5 stars is: the salads are meh and it's a bit pricey in my opinion.\n\nOn the other hand, the pizza is really, really good.  In my top 5 pizzas ever.  But what I crave the most from here are the Mushroom pepper cheese steaks.  This is comfort food at it's greasiest and finest.  I order it with peppers and banana peppers and it's fantastic.  Great wings, too.  I order them with extra medium sauce.  \n\nI've had other items here, but basically, if you want the best of the best, stick with the pizza, cheese steaks, and wings.",1
"O So good!! I usually get the Philly Cheese Steak w/ mushrooms and extra cheese. It is excellent. The atmosphere is Americanized which I love since everything around Central Phoenix caters to the Hispanics first then Americans.  Like I said the food is great, the reason only four stars is because the service sucks (Having to bring the waiter your cup for a refill every time I go there gets a little old) But other than that is definitely  worth a try!!!",1
"Eek! My sister and I went here a month or so ago, didn't have the most pleasant experience. Expensive I remember it...The service was depressing. Our waitress largely forgot about us and the other staff were all pretty apathetic. Had to wait ten minutes to get a drink refill, and the pizza was not very good. I haven't tried their sandwiches, perhaps that's their forte, but customer service certainly is not one of their primary concerns.",0
Uncle Sam's is my favorite local eatery.  My little one loves the pizza and fries and I am a fan of the Philly cheese steak which is by far the best in town (I have been to South Street in Philly several times and can compare!)\n\nThe wings and hoagies are also great.\n\nThe only reason I gave it a four star and not a five is the salads are overpriced.,1
"I moved into the neighborhood and was looking forward to a good local pizza and hoagie spot...  this isn't it.  \n\nI've given this place more than one opportunity to redeem itself, but each visit is worse than the last.  The food is sub-standard at best and the waitstaff, although 'sorry' can't/won't do anything to make it any better.\n\nIf you're hungry there are many other places to eat that won't leave you as disappointed as this place.",0
"There are two Uncle Sam's that I know of (and no, I am not talking about UNCLE SAM as in Big Brother!) and the one on Shea and 32nd street is the best.  I have eaten at the much larger restaurant on Shea and 92nd in Scottsdale, and IMHO, it lacks character.  The service at 32nd street is exceptional, and very, very fast (even when packed).  The food is good, with ample portions.  The only negative is that if you want french fries you have to order them as a side.  I think this is a shame, because while they are tasty -- they simply add a lot of extra $$ to the end of your bill.  Overall, my favorite choice there is the calzone (which has cheese and spinach inside).  I like that I can get a mini calzone and take half of it home and eat it for lunch the next day.  Tip:  go early for best seating.  Large parties are difficult, but they do a good job of seating you in the back.  Crowded at lunch and dinner.",1
"So I've been told by someone that Uncle Sams has the best cheese steaks in town. I finally made it to the 32nd & Shea location and tried these so called best cheese steaks in town.\n\nBeing the food snob I am and somewhat of a cheese steak expert, I must say Uncle Sams has SOME of the best cheese steaks in. A close second in my opinion. The only cheese steak I've have in the PHX area that was better was at Flancers in Gilbert. Flancers are by far the best cheese steaks in town.\n\nI will be back to Uncle Sams for another cheese steak and maybe give the pizza a try.",1
Love the hot honey BBQ wings and the white pizza!can't beat the happy hour beer prices $1 pints domestic!!!love it,1
"Not sure what all the positive reviews are for, I went here the other day and was not the least bit impressed. I heard good things about their cheesesteaks, and since I have never had a cheesesteak before I thought I'd try them out. There wasn't much meat in the sandwich, and it lacked cheese. I told them no onions and yet onions were still sprinkled throughout the sandwich.\n\nEven their salad was terrible, the ranch was runny and it didn't even have any croutons on it. The prices were kind of high and the place was extremely dirty. Will never go back again.",0
"It's been awhile since I've been here (now living elsewhere), but I remember the honey BBQ chicken wings and the garlic bread with such fondness.  They were sooooooooooo good, I miss those two menu items.  While I've had good garlic bread in CA, I have not found the same caliber honey BBQ wings.  It was a great after-the-game hotspot for some really good, fun food.......and YUMMY.",1
Nobody can beat Uncle Sam's when it comes to bang for your buck. This is even more true during happy hour where the prices are insane and that runs from 5-7 & 7-9. Can get very crowded and is a bit old but it never bothered me and I think it adds character. Food is hot and the drinks are cold.,1
"Never had a problem until tonight. Waited 40+ minutes for our waitess to take our food order. After years of patronage, I won't be back for a while. Sorry, but I'm a vengeful s.o.b.",0
"What can I say !!!! Maybe just that they serve it all wings, pizza sandwiches and ice cold beer plus the servers are real nice too.  Need a place where you want to grab a bite to eat without all the other stuff??? this is it!!!  kinda like the spot around the corner you have grown to love.  Here is where we came after a buddy needed help moving and dinner was on him, lots of choices and did I mention these guys get you food out \""""real\"""" fast it will spin your head.  A++ Emoney Approved... \n\nGood affordable American Food :)",1
"I have been going to this Uncle Sam's location prior to the Peoria & Scottsdale locations ever opening and I have to say, the food at this location is heads and tales above the other 2. We are closer to the Peoria location but the service and food are hit or miss, always. \n\nNow on to the Shea location. Hmmm, the food, hot, cheesy, greasy, fried goodness. You can't go wrong with the cheesesteak, order it with fried onions and a mix of the vinegary hot peppers and the briny sweet peppers..they have a 1/4 of a sandwich on the bail out menu but order the half or whole to take home for the next day..even better.  Beer battered onion rings are top notch as are the breaded fried zucchini. Both come with bangin' ranch, we always need more.\n\nI am not a big fan of their pizza, but the calzone, that's another story. Awesome cheesy, saucy goodness. When I'm in the mood for a cold sandwich I always go with the Italian Supreme, but if you are ordering to go and you get the cold sandwich ask for the italian dressing on the side, you will end up with a soggy mess. A tasty mess, but still a mess.\n\nThe only reason that I don't give the Shea Uncle Sam's a 5 star rating is they only serve Pepsi products and I am a big, big Coke drinker, rather die of thirst than drink a Pepsi sort of thing..they do have great ice tea though, just ask for extra lemon if it's your forte'.",1
"Good service, clean  & GREAT Philly cheese steak!",1
"Indifferent food, atrocious service.",0
"i love love love this place! \nTOP REASONS WHY I LOVE THIS PLACE:\n-The americana theme\n-Best happy hour in the valley\n- service is outstanding :) \n I had a philly yummmyyy\n (: its not a fancy place but it is a place you will be coming back to every week! \nWAY TO GOO UNCLE SAM'S, ITS MORE LIKE I WANT UNCLE SAM'S IN MY HOME KITCHEN !!!",1
"They are not consistent with how the food tastes one week it's good and then the next week it's horrible they tend to switch cooks often. The servers are young and incompetent waitresses that are RUDE, DISRESPECTFUL, and don't give the customers what they want!! We should get the food cooked how we want it at the prices their selling it at! They need to have a serious management reconfiguration. This used to be my favorite place now it's at an all time low! These guys need to be on the Restaurant Stakeout so the owner can see how his business is being ran!",0
"Used to get their pizza all the time, but its been a few years. Husband and I stopped today for lunch. Halfway thru my 2nd piece, a cockroach runs across our table. It had been in my husbands napkins. We showed the mgr. he said that they had been having problems but had sprayed. Don't think that I will go back. The pizza is good but apparently the old building has issues.",0
"Been customer for years, got home with my white 3 meat large pizza and wings! Wow wings always good and as expected for my 25 honey hots!  But my 3 meat white pizza was missing meat!  Every edge and  2 in from the edge had no stinking meat? I'm like what went wrong when I got home! \nWe should have called but what's the point\nWhen I have super hungry people, so next time I have to check it I guess!",0
1st day for Cardinal football.  Thought this would be perfect. They raised beer prices by a quarter big deal. But the bad part is no sound for the cardinals game and they kept the juke box going.  We complained about it and they said to bad but the Dallas game that night we could listen to it.  Last year the girls could wear jerseys during football but not this year.  Thanks but no thanks,0
Just had a cheese steak sandwich here and realize that they had NFL happy hour made me very happy and the cheese steak was awesome definitely a comeback to,1
"Tonight we are having 2 of Uncle Sam's best - the cheesesteak with mushrooms and extra cheese. The second sandwich is the All-American Grinder (lose the green  peppers and add a large amount of of jalapenos.)  all of this to go so we come watch a recordeding of the Tuesday night NCIS Los Angeles. Just could not get any better.  Hey we like eating at Uncle Sam just as much as the next person , bye you just can't beat take out from this restaurant , so fresh so hot so tasty.",1
"That awkward moment when you realise that you get what you pay for. I actually use to really like this place. Great happy hour. Good flavors on the wings. I guess the awkward part of it all is that I'm not 23 anymore and my expectations are higher than they use to be. Like tonight, for example. I placed an easy order of happy hour wings and a brew. Well... no. I got a full order. When I informed the server ( young red head with tats behind her ears and plugs) that I only ordered a small order of wings, she offered to get me a box. I figured this was so she didn't have to get management involved with the switch or what not, despite my eager suggestion. Needless to say, the evening continued. I eat one wing... literally one! A cockroach walks onto the bar. It was small and may have been a beetle, but still... ew! ! There goes my appetite!  \n\nWords of advice.  If you do decide to come to good ol' Unc' Sam's, wear protection. Serves with mediocre at best. The gals working there are 12, so I don't expect much I suppose. However,  the Peoria location is much better and cleaner ( it seems like). I'm only giving two stars because of the cheap beer and the decent wings. Not good!!! Just decent. I think the beer helps. \n\nLong story short. If you have a party and want cheap cheapness... well then you've found... omg... an other cockroach just walked up on the bar! Are you absolutely kidding me!? Im seriously about to freak out and walk out. I don't care if I haven't paid. This is embarrassing!!! DO. NOT.  EAT. HERE!!!",0
"I legitimately will never give this place another try again. \n\nThe first time we came here (boyfriend and I) we ordered a pizza, mozzarella sticks, and french fries. In the meantime, a waitress was bussing the table behind us and was extremely loud talking to another employee. And when I say loud, I mean LOUD. But that's not what bothered me. What bothered me is what she said... \""""WOW! I didn't think they were going to tip me that much because they were black!\"""" Referring to the family at the table that had just left.  This is absolutely unacceptable, and I don't care what age, race, or what establishment you work in. Advice to the owners/managers- don't hire ignorant staff! Aside from that the food was just okay. Pizza was comparable to something that comes out of a frozen-food box, mozzarella sticks came out luke-warm (meaning the cheese was hard) and french fries were comparable to what you get in a grade-school cafeteria. \n\nSecond time we were here we came for what we thought would be a quick lunch. Serivce was so absolutely slow an incompetent. I ordered a garden salad (or whatever version of that is the small version) and the lettuce came out soggy and there was water at the bottom of the salad bowl. Talk about unappetizing. The whole meal service took nearly an hour and twenty minutes. So much for a quick lunch.. '\n\nThe third and last time I came here, I came with the idea that maybe \""""the third time's a charm.\"""" Boy was I wrong. I ordered the dinner Ceasar salad, boyfriend ordered a small 7\"""" pizza with buffalo sauce instead of marinara, and we shared a side of fries. \nMy salad came out with the most unappetizing lettuce I have ever eaten in my life. The lettuce was wilted and nearly rotten, and seemed as if the romaine was cut in half (referencing the large pieces of lettuce). His pizza came out with barbeque sauce instead of buffalo. The waitress took it back, but when she did she took the tray and poked and prodded her fingers around the pizza to ensure that it was barbecue and not buffalo. Regardless of the fact that we didn't eat it that's still disgusting. \n\nAside from the terrible food and service, this place is dirty (and by dirty that's a compliment) and dingy and is nothing impressive to look at. No, I will not give this place another try. Sorry, Uncle Sam's.",0
"I will never be back. We went once for dinner upon a friend recommending their cheese steak. We ordered an Italian sub and meatball sub. The waitress brought out the food within 3 minutes of ordering. My sub wasn't even hot which was a deal breaker for me. The Italian that I had a bite of had barely any meat on it. Thank goodness the fries were worthy. To top it off, our check was over $30 which is ridiculous for 2 sub-par subs, fries and 2 Cokes. It was Subway quality IMO. I really wanted to like this place.",0
"If you're 16 this will probably be right up your alley.  The servers are all young, cute girls but haven't properly been trained.  I went here with friends and ordered a couple of cheese steaks and grilled chicken salad,  both of our steaks were cold by the time they arrived and the chicken was raw.  We told the waitress and she said...oh I'm sorry but that was it.  I don't think the kitchen staff cares what they turn out because they are chasing the girls.  It's gone down hill lately and it's sad because I live in the neighborhood.  I won't go back.",0
"Sometimes its excellent, sometimes its the worst.  Never usually anything in between.  I always order the same thing, mushroom pepper cheesesteak and hot wings.  So basically, its a 50/50 shot whether or not you will enjoy your experience.",0
"This place is just ok , not the worst divey place I've eaten at but not the best .. The wings are pretty good .. Fried Zuchinni not bad. We also ordered a calzon , no flavor .. Tasted like can and jar ingredients and was cold on the inside .. Asked her to re-heat it and still came back cold.. So we just had it boxed and I will put in the oven when we get home ! Staff seemed friendly , although no one seemed over 16 years old :-/",0
The service was good. Ill give them that. Their cheese steak sandwich was terrible. Meat and cheese and bread and a hint of sauce. Ive had a better chese steak sandwich arbys. The bread was great. The meat was over cooked and seemed like it was sitting under a heat lamp for hours. Barely any cheese and almost no sauce. Try somewhere else for a chese steak. Paid $8 for 9 inches of bleh.,0

We had a sick cat and had to find a vet near our house. Shea Animal hospital was down the street so we decided to take him there. They were so nice and friendly and loved Atticus immediately. That was in November 2011.\n\n A couple days ago I noticed our cat having a hard time breathing so I called them. Dr. Organek treated him before and she called me back and also scheduled the appointment for me for the next day. Unfortunately we ended up having to put our sweet kitty to sleep but Dr. Organek spent almost 3 hours with us and talked to my husband on the phone and answered all of our questions. She was also very sympathetic. This was 4/5/12. On 4/7/12 we received a sympathy card from her. \n\nWe are very happy with their services and would bring our pets to them again.,1

This place killed my dog!!! After changing his seizure medication per Dr. Farrington two weeks into the transition he started showing signs of abnormal behavior I called the vet office to get the Dr. advice. No call back!  Four days later he entered the longest seizure hes ever had I took him to the ER they pumped Valium into him and hours later the seizures finally stopped after three days in the ER doctors that worked there contacted Shea Animal Hospital to speak with Dr. Farrington still they couldnt get a hold of him.  I tried nursing my dog of 12 years back to health but it was clear he was gone and I had to make the tough decision to put him down.  Dr. Farrington Im calling you out your negligence has taken my best friend away and you should be ashamed of yourself!!!  Be warned,0
Dr. Larsen is wonderful! He is extremely professional and a wonderful Dr! I would highly suggest him!,1
Dr Larson at Shea Chiropractic can really get you straightened out with a minimal amount of visits. I was referred to Shea Chiro over 5 years ago by an associate. I am so glad to have such a great place in our neighborhood. I know people that drive all the way from Goodyear to use there services.,1
"La Playa is a quaint dive bar that recently got a makeover. Its glass walls were painted black which made for interesting summer visits. But now it attempts to have a beach motif, complete with a faux great white shark head biting an Arizona license plate and puffer fish. \n\nIt offers two pool tables, an electronic dart board and a pinball machine or two. Nothing remarkable there. It is well lit which coincides with its new attitude. There is also a digital jukebox and few pay-to-play digital game consoles at the end of the bar. \n\nI have yet to eat the food. Honestly I will not likely try it. \n\nThere are a few pool/lawn plastic seats to sit on outside. They have some small plastic bins for garbage and cigarette refuse.\n\nBut the drinks are great and the prices cannot be beat. There is a very gorgeous bartender there sometimes. She is actually worth the trip. She makes a great root beer shot. None of the other customers seemed dismayed that there is no (none that I saw anyway) wine. Overall a pleasant drinking experience.",1
"With football season just around the corner you need to find a place to watch your team & this place is great! Free breakfast and all the games on sunday. Very chill and you can even hear your game, plus the bartenders know how to pour a drink & are easy on the eyes. A+",1
Great place for cheap drinks! \nEverybody knows each other and you can becom part of the Playa family quick :)\nSharen ( the owner ) is very friendly and nice and she will remember your name and what you drink after one visit.\n\nGreat place to watch games !,1
"So glad my co-worker and I went and checked this place out before we did Friday happy hour with our 15 co-workers!\n\nBartender did not greet us even though all of the men at the bar turned to look...sure she saw us.  we sat down read the menu 3x.  Long day at work and the last thing I wanted to do was hunt down a beer.\n\nWe waited around for 15 min at a table and left.  We then walked 20 yards to Uncle Sam's and had beer in hand in within 5 min.\n\nI am so disappointed!  I was excited to bring my co-workers to a new place \""""for us\"""" that has fish tacos.\n\nUnfortunately we did not even have the chance to try anything other than the service.  Not a chance in hell I would take/ask my coworkers to this place.  I would have been mortified if 15 of my friends came\n in and were ignored on my recommendation.\n\nSucks cause it looked so\nFun until u couldn't get a beer!",0
"We have come here before and have had wonderful service. We came in for our second time a few nights ago and I was hugely disappointed. I had looked at their drink menu and saw one of my favorite drinks (a mudslide) and couldn't wait to do it. When my friend went to order the bar tender claimed to not have either of the drinks we wanted. My friend came back to the table to grab the menu and show her that you do in fact have those drinks. Realizing so, she then asked if I wanted my mudslide as a martini or on poured over ice...well then...last time I checked mudslides are a frozen drink, like a frozen margarita. But she explained that's not a choice which once again said frozen on the menu. I still ordered it and to say the least tasted good still. But I don't think she knew her menu, bar, or her job very well.  I wish her the best of luck with future guest. My friend loves this bar so we will be back but hopefully the next time I am there the bartender will be more knowledgeable.",0

"The chicken is good, the strips are nice and fresh, but the mac & cheese is just awful.  They started offering a \""""baked\"""" mac&cheese, but it's really just the same crap with a little shredded cheese put in.  They make you ask for tea that if only available behind the counter.  That's not a big deal if it's not busy.  When it is busy, expect to wait and it feels like your bothering them.  I tried the new fish filets as well and lets just say you might want to pass.  This place isn't the cleanest place in the world but the standard chicken is good and not as greasy as say KFC.  The people there have always been very nice and helpful.\n\n*Update* 06-04-2013 :  The so called Texas Chicken was nothing like the advertisement and was just a non-breaded fried half chicken dusted with spices. It was so dry and was something I would never want to get again.  The ads looked so good too.",0
"You truly can never go wrong with Church's Fried Chicken.  Is it healthy? Nope, but man, is it good.  Their flavor for the chicken is just so consistent every time and so tasty.  Their mashed potatoes are also great along with the fried okra.  The corn has always been bad every time we buy it...it always looks so good, but every time, it's bland and soggy.  There is a girl that works there that is quite obnoxious.  She's loud, talks to herself, and talks randomly to people with the strangest remarks.  Though she's happy...you can clearly tell her co-workers can't stand her.  Poor girl.  Anyway, for the few times we get CFC, it beats out any other fried chicken place such as KFC or Popeye's.",1
"25 years ago I tried Churches, and didn't like it then. Tried it Friday, yuk, same fatty-greasy-over cooked chicken . Other yelpers right, mac & cheese is play-dough like in nature.  Mashed potatoes & gravy in one container?? Your mom didn't serve it that way, so where'd you learn it? The only thing good was the corn on the cob! Tender juicy-excellent!  KFC May be out of your neighborhood & a little bit more $$, but it's worth the drive.",0
This location sucks. They messed up my order twice in one night and didn't even offer to compensate me. Never going back.,0
"I saw this Church's Fried Chicken place while filling up with gas at 32nd street.  I couldn't help but try them as I was a Church's Fried Chicken virgin.  My mother used to eat it ALL THE TIME in upper Manhattan in New York City where she ran a store.  I guess it was a quick, cheap lunch, but it had to be more than that as my mother was a good cook who knew how to make good chicken herself.  I walked in for the $2.99 order which seemed cool (two pieces of chicken, one side and one biscuit), but after all was said and done I upgraded to an additional side and an additional biscuit--still a good value for the money.  \nGot home with my chicken in tow, thinking of mom all the way since I was carrying her favorite meal. Wondering if I would like it.  \nMy two pieces of chicken were ample, crispy and not as greasy as I expected.  I have had chicken that begins with a \""""K\""""  and found it to be greasy around these parts so I was pleasantly surprised with how un-greasy it was.  The biscuits were soft like biscuits should be (not hockey-pucks).  However, they put some type of sweet glaze on it that I would have omitted.  I like my biscuits like biscuits--they are not dessert --they are supposed to complement the chicken.  I would have left that glaze off.  Would I eat them again.  Yup.  The mashed potatoes and gravy were good.  Glad I upgraded to an extra side so now I have one in the fridge waiting for me to dig into it.   So there you have it.  Good chicken, good mashed potatoes and a pretty good biscuit.  Yelpers are complaining about the mac and cheese here.  SO DON'T GET IT. Few places make real good mac and cheese.  And some restaurants feel that they have to add four cheeses to the Mac and Cheese to make it good.  NO, NO, NO, NO.  Use sharp cheddar and make a b\u00e9chamel sauce, etc etc.  (can't give you my whole recipe or you will make mac and cheese as well as I do.  NO CAN DO. I want to remain the Queen of Mac & Cheese in my family!!)   Now you know the real deal---it's the mashed potatoes you should go for when you go to a Church's Chicken.  So despite the complaints by some Yelpers, the \""""Boss Lady\"""" came, bought and ate Church's Chicken and liked it.  There you have it.",1
"I was referred to this practice by a colleague of mine. I was very excited to find a \""""one stop shop\"""" family practice where lab and x-ray's can be done in the office, to avoid the troubles of having to go to a lab and wait for the results, then go back into the office. \n\nDr. Sobel is a very personal man. I have no qualms with him. However, my first visit, Jessica, was quite rude and remained so with every visit.  Although I had a scheduled appointment, I waited in the lobby for about 30 plus mins before being walked back, only to wait another 15-20 mins before Dr. Larry would see me. \n\nAt first I thought it was just an anomaly. However, it was like that every visit, and the office staff was not forthcoming about running behind schedule, and very unapologetic. \n\nYesterday's experience took me over the edge. My appt was at 3:40p.m., I did not get called back into the office until after 4:45p.m. LITERALLY! I had checked in with \""""Jessica\"""" a couple of times to inquire as to why it was taking so long, she said my \""""chart was up there and will be called in order\"""", stating, \""""this is Dr. Larry\"""".  However, I noted some people were called in earlier than I that came in later. I was finally seated in an exam room and waited until 5:14 p.m. before coming out and asking what the deal was. I asked if Dr. Sobel was being over booked or this is how late he runs all the time. They said, \""""It's Dr. Sobel\"""". \""""He spends a lot of time with his patient's\"""". Although that may be a good thing, it should not be at the expense of the next patient.  it is my professional opinion, that if he spends a lot of time with his patient's, then they should schedule accordingly to allow room for that time, instead of making patient's wait an hour and a half to be seen. \n\nThis kind of management is totally unprofessional and unacceptable. Of note, Dr. Larry Sobel overheard my questioning, and while visiting with another patient, and said...\""""You can leave if you want\"""". I left and will not be back again.\n\nThe courtesy from his staff up front should've been, Dr. Larry is running an hour behind...and allow me the option to reschedule.",0
Always a long wait to see the doctor. Today waited an hour and a half with no one updating me with ones going on or an apology.

Never happy with the staff every time I've gone and this what the icing on the cake.,0
"Unless it's changed, be forewarned, the staff is unfriendly or rude, depending on your ethnicity, and you can wait up to 1 hour and a half before you finally see the doctor.

It's a small place and has been at the same location for something like 20 years, so the decor is slightly dated but we go there all the time for the fabulous food and wine. Brad is awesome as host/waiter/bartender, and of course we alwasy enjoy a visit to our table by Michelina's herself, which is always a nice touch.",1
I have been to Michelinas a couple times in the last 6 years or so. Both times the food was very good.\n\nLast time I had the eggplant Parmesan. Very tasty and a generous portion. My husband had their seafood pasta which he said was delicious.\n\nThe only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because of the steep prices. It's not very often I spend more than $20 on a vegetarian dish. Hence why I only went a couple times. But the service is great and the atmosphere is classy and romantic. It is a good place for a special occasion.,1
"Correcting some gross Misconceptions on Yelp regarding Michelina's.... PART 1\n\n   My review will be overwhelmingly thorough, to aid others I will post in a 'bullet point' format for ease of reference (I have enjoyed this restaurant approximately 10 times in the last year (I am a foodie what can I say)...\n\nHistory- Michelina immigrated approximately 29 years ago and opened her wonderful \""""Ristorante\""""(more on what this means later) and blessed Phoenix approximately 27 years ago...\n\nFood- Excellent! Italian food from the area of NAPLES (this is where Michelina is from)... Food from this region is a blend, \""""Campania is one of the largest producers and consumers of pasta in Italy, especially spaghetti. In the regional cuisine, pasta is prepared in various styles that can feature tomato sauce, cheese, clams and shellfish.(Wikipedia)\"""" PUTNESCA IS A POPULAR SAUCE from Naples...\n\nRecommendations for food: One SHOULD attempt to incorporate seafood/shellfish as a choice; however, Michelina's has many excellent 'Turf' options (osso bucco, veal, eggplant, etc...)...\n\nAppetizers: Escargots (dip the bread for garlic and butter lovers, this is the best)\n\nOysters Michelina-fantastic\n\nSALAD IS OFFERED COMPLIMENTARY (FYI)\n\nThe bread is exquisite (with butter how its meant to be churned)\n\nEntrees:\nSurf: Many fresh fish specials usually served ala Putnesca (fantastic)\nTurf: Osso Bucco (frequent special, this meat will fall off the shank and is incredibly tender, flavorful, and moist), Veal Saltimbucco, Veal Piccata\n\n\nDessert-  zabaione (with fresh berries) by far the best!!!!\nTiramasu- not bad but do yourself a favor and get the Zabione\n\nA complimentary cordial is provided (fyi)\n\nREAL ITALIAN MASCULINE COFFEE (go espresso or Cappuccino and you will be pleased (don't expect fu fu starbucks)\n\n\nDining EXPERIENCE- In Italy one enjoys the 'TABLE' for the evening (i.e. it is not a rushed affair, rather something to be savored and relished in)....(Notice it is an Italian named Restaurant (not Michelina's Restaurant) but rather \""""Michelina's Ristorante Costa Campagnia\"""" which means, \""""Michelina's [exquisite/higher end] Italian restaurant featuring food from Campagnia\"""".... \n\nService- Brad is a wonderful and exceptional server... Request him if possible... Additionally, as inferred from \""""Dining Experience\"""" above, this is an Experience to be savored... IF YOU HAVE TIME CONSTRAINTS, IMMEDIATELY INFORM BRAD, they will be accommodated (i.e. opera, symphony, movie, or just want a wonderful meal at a heightened pace).... The service WILL NOT HOVER over you as an American Restaurant will!!!!!! The exceptional service staff wants you to enjoy and relish the evening, as is done in Italy...\n\nAmbiance- The restaurant is classically subtle and expresses the 'family and regional' values of Michelina's experiences in Naples as a young woman.... Some may call it dated, others may suggest classically influenced, and yet those that appreciate the Italian cuisine and experience might suggest that it is \""""Old School\"""" in a \""""Marlon Brando\""""-esque way... For those of you unfamiliar with Marlon, Michelina's IS HOW A NAPLES RESTAURANT IS?WAS?AND SHOULD ALWAYS BE....\n\nTO CORRECT SOME GROSS MISCONCEPTIONS OF OTHERS I WILL ADDRESS them below...\n\n           \""""There is nothing eye catching about the business front at all.  It's in a strip mall and looks old.  At night, they turn on strands of tacky Christmas lights that only attract attention to the fact that the lights are so poorly hung.\""""\n\n- The restaurant is 'Unassuming' from the outside, this is a treasure, not to be shared with just anyone... It also looks old because it is, she has been in this location for 20+ years....\n\n\""""When we arrived for dinner we were greeted by an empty corridor, no host station and no host.  We could see what looked to be a bar but it wasn't a bar that I'd want to eat, drink and socialize at.\""""\n\n-Michelina's is not a bar, they have excellent drinks however. Additionally, Michelina's is family run AND the expectation (once you have been their more than once) is to walk in and introduce yourself to Brad or Michelina's son (as you will become friends to dine with)....\n\n\""""To pass the time until we were finally greeted we browsed the many framed publications touting how incredible the place was.  I'm already here...I don't need any more persuasion.  It's time for the Chef/owner to take down the \""""look how good I was\"""" trophy wall and go with a more inviting modern look.\""""\n\n-See Ambiance section above... Michelina is a remarkable woman and created this restaurant from LITERALLY NOTHING 27 years ago... She has won best Italian in AZ/Phx many times and would continue to win (however the same restaurant winning does not sell reviews/publications)...\n\n...To be continued..",1
"Very good food. Love the bread, salad and stuffed shells w/alfredo sauce. The complimentary after dinner drink is pretty awesome too. Great spot.",1
"Don't let the location put you off. It's in a run down, dinky strip center, but the restaurant itself is very nice.\n\nThe staff was very friendly, professional and attentive. The food was also very good. Our group had the salmon, veal Marsala and Lasagna. All were very tasty and included salads. They don't have a kids menu, but my 8 & 10 yr olds had no problem finding something they liked on the menu.\n\nPortion sizes were just right, except for the Lasagna which was huge! Prices were on par with similar nice restaurants in Phoenix/Scottsdale area.",1
"Exceedingly slow, even though they didn't seem that busy. Very poor quality wash. They actually smeared dirt on previously spotless areas on the interior.",0
"Bad news for any regulars here.\nSilvertouch is no longer. \nThey've sold and are operating under Arizona Car Wash.\nBobby is also no longer there.  \nProps to the Weiss brothers and Bobby for many years of cleaning my rides, and the great personal touch. \n\nAs for the new company? \nRude order taker.\nBad vacuum.\nHalf-assed cleaned.\nInside not cleaned.\n\nI wouldn't give these guys the air out of my ass to cool their soup, let alone another dollar. \nTime to find a new car wash.",0
"I had a mixed experience with this company. I am currently 29 weeks pregnant.  We hired them to pack and move me out of a 3-bedroom rental into our new place. In part, I blame myself for contracting with the on nothing more than an email quoting an hourly rate for packing and the move. If they quote you an hourly rate, I _highly_ recommend getting them to commit to a maximum time-frame for your project and have them provide a price list for any packing materials to be used.\n\nThe two men I had for the packing were courteous and relatively efficient. I was shocked, however, at what we ended up being charged for boxes and packing material. Especially, when asked, they could not provide us any sort of itemization for what was used. \n\nThe next day for the move, we had one of the same people and a new person who seemed to be about 20 with very little experience moving. Again, they were courteous and very careful in the handling of our furniture. But they were the slowest movers I've ever used. \n\nIt took just short of eight hours for them to move a three-bedroom house. There was a great deal of chatting between the two movers and hanging out in the truck. The \""""greener\"""" of the two movers also frequently hovered around seeming uncertain of what needed to be done next.  I was literally standing over them in the 110 degree heat by the end of it trying to get them to finish. It then took them close to another hour to get hold of the main office and try to figure out the paperwork. \n\nWe had planned to also use this company for my partner's move in two weeks but, based on our experience, we will be using another company.",0
"Worst customer service ever. \n\nFirst of all, I have used this company in the past and was absolutely thrilled when I used them before...but it was a different franchise...one that didn't have Delores as their GM.\n\nLet me set the stage. My husband and I just bought our first house and couldn't wait to finally move and be settled in. We called to make an appointment for 11 am about a month in advance. The day of the move, they show up at 7:30 am. We weren't expecting them so early and asked if they could come back later. The movers said that it wouldn't be a problem and that they would be back at noon.\n\nWe called the branch just to make sure that everything was still set up for noon and that's when everything started to go downhill. Delores answered and told us that it was our fault that we weren't ready (even though we never agreed to 7:30) and refused to make it right or admit fault. I asked if there was another branch that we could try and she told me that she would have Tyler, the other branch's DM, call me. (Why she couldn't have offered this as a solution in the beginning, I don't know.)\n\nI didn't know that prior to me calling Tyler, Delores had sent an email to him informing us of our situation and essentially telling him to mirror her response of \""""we'll try\"""". He also refused to help us because of this.\n\nWe spent the rest of the day calling other companies to see if anyone could move us on such short notice but no one could. We ended up getting a better rate from Camelback Movers and excellent service the next day.\n\nHowever, the problems with Two Men and a Truck don't stop there though. We were in the middle of moving (with Camelback Movers) when we get a call from Delores. She tells us that she can provide movers if we still need it. We told her that we went with someone else after she refused to help us. She then proceeded to tell me that they were still going to charge us for coming to our apartment the previous day (even though they came hours ahead of schedule AND ensured us that it was no problem for them to come back).\n\nWe, of course, had every right to argue that charge. She put me on hold but forgot to mute the line and I could hear her talking to the owner's son who told Delores just to drop it and that it wasn't worth the fight. She was determined to charge us, however, because when she came back to the phone call, she told me that they would agree to pay half.\n\nAs a company, agreeing to pay half is just as good as admitting fault. Her only argument for feeling she had the right to charge us was a confirmation email (which had the incorrect time). I hadn't noticed that the time was different when they sent it and when they called to confirm, there was no mention of time. Meaning there was no contract (neither verbally nor written) for the time of 7:30.\n\nAfter explaining this to Delores over the phone, she decided that the most professional thing to do was to hang up on my husband. She told him that she was no longer interested in having this conversation and terminated the call while he was mid-sentence.\n\nUltimately, they never did charge us (because we had done nothing wrong) and we ended up with a much better company (Camelback Movers) for a lower rate.",0
"I would not recommend this company, sometimes it just pays to pay more extra $$ for the quality of service and assurance of getting what you paid for. We hired Two Men for a total of 4 hours. Three men showed up and they had us sign some paperwork and went to work. However, they took MANY breaks and since it was an apartment complex that we moved out of, I could not see what they were doing only I know it does not take that long each time to load a few boxes into a truck parked 50 feet away. Eventually I came outside to see what was taking so long, to see them drinking and talking in the parking lot. What the heck? I understand it is still hot outside in November but it's not that damn hot, and it's completely unnecessary to take that many breaks.\n\nEventually we are on the road and arrive at the house and everything went at an acceptable pace. Two of the men took a bathroom break which was fine but when the time came to pay the bill, they charged us for another increment of time even though the man admittedly stated that we only went over by 5 minutes! Something about it being \""""policy\"""" to charge another increment if even only over by a few minutes. I think if they wouldn't have been taking so many damn breaks they would have finished on time. \n\nEven though customer service was sympathetic, they didn't offer a refund of the additional increment. A manager called us a few days later and seemed angry that his employees had been slacking off, however I didn't want to bother with the issue anymore so I told him it was fine. I will listen to the reviews more closely the next time I move and avoid this business like the plague.",0
"STAY AWAY!!!  My rating is zero stars.  \n\nI called to schedule a move of just one item, a treadmill.  I gave two men and a truck  the addresses of where it was going to be moved between and told them that where it is going to be moved to is a two story house and the treadmill will be going upstairs.  They gave me two options, one was to pay by the hour and the other was a flat rate.  The person I talked to (Austin) told me that he recommends I go with the flat rate, because if I choose the per hour option that I risk paying more if the move takes longer than expected.  Therefore, I chose the flat rate, which was $140.  \n\nThe two movers that were sent out did great work, however when they finished the move they told me that their boss (Jimmy) had called them and said that he was not happy that the move took longer than expected and that he wanted me to pay per hour for a total of $335.  I told him that I had the contract showing that I had agreed to a flat $140, to which he replied \""""Don't make me call the cops for theft of services\"""".  Feeling very confident about my position considering that my scope of work matched exactly to what we'd agreed on and that I had a contract stating that it would be billed at a flat rate of $140, I told him that I would be delighted for the police to come by.  It was at that time that he called one of his movers, who were till at my house and told them to go ahead and charge the $140.  \n\nThere are plenty of other highly rated movers on yelp, one of which I have used in the past (hint they have a 4.5 star rating with over 100 excellent reviews - they're in the CAMELBACK area) that I was extremely happy with.  The only reason I didn't use them for this move is that they said they have a minimum charge for a job and that it would not make sense for me to pay that to move just one item.  In other words they were honest.",0

"Took our Accord here to get tinted.  While the tint color was as expected, we had some bubbles.  They did tell us to go back in 2 weeks if the bubbles didn't go away.

Not sure what happened, but I am sure that I don't want them to touch my windows anymore.",0

I have a juicer so we use A LOT of produce and Food City has 80% cheaper produce than any other grocery stores in the state. \n\n2. Cheap ass spices - I recently made Puerco pibil and needed Anchiote, I found it for $2 in a small bag. The only other store I found that carried it was charging over $12, no lie. \n\nSo I can't vouch for the rest of the store, but if you need spices or produce the is THE SPOT!",1

"This library is depressing. The hours suck, (Scottsdale Libraries are open much later.) It's hot, and it's always overcrowded. The selection is disappointing, and it's hardly silent. It really sucks, because it's within walking distance of my house.",0
"Just stopped in here, felt the need to write an update. Nothing changes here. It's consistently blazing hot inside, (even on a rainy day, like today), it's extremely overcrowded and small, and the selection is still disappointing. The only reason I even wasted my time to walk in the doors here was I need to write a research paper for Friday. Being the procrastinator I am, I'm just now gathering resources for this. But HA, resources, at Mesquite?! You MUST be joking. There were barely a dozen magazines on the shelves, and the children's section takes up 1/3 of the entire building. And hey man, I'm all for children getting into reading, but really, this facility is far too small to do anything at. No cubicles, about 5 tables to study at, narrow aisles between useless materials, and not a single vacant computer station in sight. I wish Westcor included this library in it's rebuffing of PV mall, because this place is a scar on the face of the city of Phoenix, Westcor Shopping Centers, and the surrounding neighborhoods. \n\nThe ONLY reason I bumped Mesquite up to 2 stars is due to the used book corner. I wish all libraries had this....so kudos for that.\n\nBut come on Mesquite, you've got so much potential. I definitely won't be returning here anytime soon.",0
"A welcome contrast to the sprawling blandness of its neighbors-the strip malls, the Paradise Valley mall, Costco-is the small but shapely Mesquite Branch Library. It was designed by Will Bruder, the don of Phoenix architecture who also gave us the Burton Barr Library. Much smaller than its cousin, the Mesquite Branch still manages to provide decent functionality within its attractive facade.\n\nI spent a fair amount of time in the the library this summer trying to cut my utilities bill. I felt they always had the AC pumping adequately. Finding a seat, however, was sometimes a problem. There just isn't enough table space. The library seems focused on serving children, to whom most of the free space is dedicated. It's hard to complain too much about that.\n\nFor adults, there are plenty of DVDs and audio recordings. The spotty book selection is bolstered by the interlibrary loan system. The newspaper selection is OK but the magazine shelf is poor. In the Used Book Corner, I can always find one or two great books for under a $1. If you have a laptop you should bring it, since the line for the computers is always long.\n\nDespite being designed to serve a much smaller community, and undergoing serious budget cuts, the Mesquite Branch still serves the area well. And it does so with great visual flair. In addition to the architecture, Lewis Alquist's Whorlpath-an outdoor garden with terrazzo patio-is a great place to relax with a book. Weather permitting, of course.",1
"I love the story time program here! I started coming this summer after having a baby and wanting to get my toddler out of the house while beating the heat. The staff here is amazing! It is a 30 minute session of singing, dancing, stories and bubbles. We look forward to this every week now. My daughter loves the take home cut out and coloring sheet. The first thing she does is come home and color it. I am so thankful for this free program.",1
"I've been coming to this library for over 10 years. I really like it. The location is great, I can charge my car at the blink station while I'm looking at books and its open late.",1
The library sure has changed over the years! Everything is so easy to find no matter what you are looking for. I out my books on hold and have them transferred from whatever library has it to my preferred location then I get an email when it's ready and they are on a specific set if shelves! Easy!\n\nOnly complain about this location is parking. The lot isn't set up very well and can get tight.,1
"I have been to this library a few times now, usually to pick up some books that are on hold or to quickly return some books. The location is ideal and yet not. It's great because it is near the Paradise Valley Mall and if you need to get some shopping done, awesome. However, if you just want to get in and out quickly, that's a little more difficult because you are near a mall that is busy, busy, busy! Cars are zipping in and out of the mall parking lot/loop and it can be difficult to get out of the library. Plus the parking lot for the actual library is on the small side and it is U shaped. So if you don't find parking, you have to leave and come back in to circle back around. Despite this, the inside is nice and has a nice lay out. I'd recommend this library just for the convenience.",1
Great location and selection. Libraries are the best thing our taxes actually go to. The security guard here is awesome and is quick to tell idiots at the library to get off their phone or to stop talking.,1
"WOW wow WOWwwwww! At first I expected this place to be a grocery store and was a little disappointed at first, but man was I in for a pleasant surprise. This place actually has books! Tons of them! I'm from Bosnia and wasn't familiar with the whole library/rent a book concept and at first I was offended that they wouldn't  take cash for the books I had chosen! I fought a bit ....especially when the worker said to bring them back in 3 weeks! However we worked things out! It's an amazing concept! You get to read a book for free and then take it back and choose a new book! America is so great",1
"Thanks once again to the magicians at Red Devil for being the culinary hit of my recent student-oriented convention. You know how it's nearly impossible to get kids to turn things like permission slips and registration forms in on time? Well, Red Devil can accommodate! A basic order to feed over 200 was placed about 72 hours in advance (but they only require 48! Good to know for last minute big parties) and then was added to with no complaints the day before the event. \n\nThe biggest hits were the meat lasagna and the alfredo pasta with broccoli and large pieces of tender white chicken. The rolls and salads were gobbled up in no time. Red Devil even made a vegan pasta and a gluten-free salad for those with special dietary needs. Everything was delivered hot, fresh, and on time, complete with plastic ware, plates, and napkins. \n\nLast year, due to the location of the convention, I used my local McDowell Red Devil. This year, it was at my school in NoSco, so we went with the Bell location. It's great to know that there is consistency in the quality of the food, generous quantity, and outstanding service at both locations. \n\nRed Devil, te amo!",1
"We both ordered pasta dishes...so not sure on pizza; which from what I read is there best item.\nAs far as the pasta dinner......salads were crsip, fresh, dressing OK...nothing special. Dinner rolls warm but doughy or chewy. I had pasta with red sauce + meatball and Italian sausage........sauce was blah......right out of a can, sausage very average. Wife had a chicken alfredo type item...also very average.  \nService was good, meal came quickly..in and out in 45 minutes. Everythng appered very clean.  \nOverall ....I wouldn't go out of my way to get pasta type dishes...I'd give it a try for pizza and see how that goes.  Overall value is average.",0
Luckys closed so that left me looking for new pizza. I am not sure why we never ordered from here before I mean this place has been there forever!! I am glad we finally tried it pizza and wings it was gooood! The sauce is fresh tastes like its supposed to and not sweet or sugary like some other place. I am pretty picky with the pizza and ordered from here 3x now without reading about it here first. Now I know not to order anything but the pizza which is fine by me!,1
Terrible. Some of the worst service and worst pizza I've ever had.,0
Ordered pizza and wings to go with some friends last night and it was just what everyone needed. The pizza was better then average and I am pretty tough on pizza but for the price and taste I feel it beats out any of the big pizza chains that deliver. Wings had good flavor and the pizza had fresh toppings. I have ordered take out before and always good quality pizza.,1
My favorite pizza in the neighborhood!,1
"I love this place, I think the biggest reason I love it so much is because my old lady loves Olive Garden so much but I hate eating there, it's so \""""chainy\"""".  Red Devil has great food, I've eaten their salad, wings, pasta, chicken, and pizza.  It's not the fanciest place in the world but they don't try to sell themselves as a fancy restaurant.  Just a really good, family, italian restaurant.  I've always had a good experience with the wait staff, especially Dewey.  Waiters don't have to be fake or say something special to me, I just want them to be nice, and they are nice here.  Prices are good, and their \""""pre-dinner\"""" roles are amazing, much better than olive gardes geasey ass breadsticks.",1
"I've never ever had a bad meal here. Service is fantastic, menu is huge. A fun place. If you go in with a bad mood, you'll walk out in a good mood.",1
"I can sum up Red Devil in a single word : disappointing. My husband and I both have a long history with Red Devil, both together and before we knew each other. It was almost always go-to place for family birthday celebrations and we even had our first date there several years ago. In the past three years, Red Devil has declined in food quality and taste and the prices have sky rocketed. It has gotten to the point where we now push for our celebrations to take place somewhere else, because it has been a consistently disappointing experience for all of us.  Our visit today prompted my review - we once again visited Red Devil for a birthday celebration. We opted for a medium cheese people because if you opt for one of their specialties you're looking at about $15 for a medium - they also have pasta entrees that share the prices of a high quality Italian restaurant, which they are not. We were there with a group of about 10 people and the rest of the place was literally empty. It took them 15 minutes to get our drinks from the time we sat down and another 40 minutes for our food to arrive after we ordered it. On top of being slow, the waitress was also extremely rude, although she would have gotten more of a tip than she decided to add to our bill, oh well. This is very disappointing, we used to love Red Devil so much.",0
"I just experienced the food from this place for the first time. We did take-out and I really enjoyed it.  We ordered the Mediterranean pizza and wings. The wings were great. The pizza was great as well except their was quite a bit of mozerella cheese and I almost choked 2x's trying to swallow the chunk of cheese. This wouldn't discourage me from eating it again, I just might request little cheese next time!",1
"After seeing a movie at the nearby Harkins, my family and I went there for my cousin's birthday dinner. We picked this place based on the positive online reviews. The place was unimpressive looking, but there was quite a wait which I took as a good sign (nobody lines up and waits for bad food...or at least they shouldn't). After half an hour we got seated. They placed us in what looked like an addition to the building and it was freezing! They had the A/C blasting and a ceiling fan going. Our server was very nice, and our drinks and salads came out rather quick. Then it took a turn for the worse. Well over an hour passed between receiving our drinks/salads and when our meals where finally brought out to us. During that time, none of our drinks were refilled, our used plates weren't removed, and no one came to check on us until the hour mark. When our food did come out it was nice and piping hot, but it was also unrecognizable. Every plate was drowning in marinara sauce. You had to do some serious excavating to uncover your food. And the food was pretty mad. We ordered spaghetti, eggplant parmesan, and the manicotti. Ragu tastes better than the sauce that they seemingly have an neverending supply of. And the eggplant was mushy and unflavorful. To add insult to injury, the prices were absurd! They charged prices on par with higher end Italian restaurants...yet this place is a far cry from anything upscale. Maybe this place is only good for the pizza, but based on this experience I'm not willing to give it a second chance.",0
"If you like mediocre service, average tasting food, dirty bathrooms and inflated prices - Red Devil is the place for you! The pizza is okay, but expensive. The menus, salt/pepper shakers and the cheese shaker seemed grimy and dirty and the waitress seemed fairly disinterested. My companion and I shared a pizza and small order of wings.  He had a soda and I had water. The bill came to just under $30. Not worth it for a very average lunch.",0
"Friday night/ Pizza night wouldn't be the same without Red Devil.  We love their pizza, love their wings and love the exceptional service that we always receive.  Especially at such a reasonable price.",1
"The pizza was gross. We tried to get away from the typical chains and tried this place. The pizza crust was tasteless, soggy and gross! We couldn't pick up the pizza slices to eat because of the soggy factor, but it was next to impossible to cut into bite size pieces because it was tough. So weird,  Won't be back.",0
"My better-half wanted Pizza for his birthday and chose this place. we parked and walked up to a window and they wanted to take our order, i asked if they had actual seating or is this a take-out only place, they told us there was a door on the side of building. we found said door and went in, we were greeted to a blond woman who saw us walk in, turn and walked to the back giving us dirty looks. another boy came out and also gave us dirty looks. then another dark haired younger girl came out and said welcome, how many, and follow me... She lead us to the very back room, which was empty, there were no other people in this large room, yet there were many other tables open in the main dining area. We sat there and 15 Minutes later we got a waitress apologizing about the wait, telling us that she didn't know we were there because they usually don't seat people in this area unless there are a very large party. Strange. She took our order and the food was ok, the manager came by to ask how everything was, the blond waitress and other staff all walked by giving us dirty looks all night long. I suppose two men going out to dinner is a horrific sight? I will never go here again.",0
"Unimpressed with this eggplant parmesan sandwich. The bread was soft, there wasn't enough cheese nor sauce and the entire bag was soaked with grease as I opened the sandwich. Not too mention, the hours of gas that came along with downing just half of this disaster. I would even go as far to say that they put something extra in this mess to cause the damage. Maybe they didn't feel like cooking anymore at just after 9pm, but whatever happened I will not be stepping within a country mile of this establishment. This Red Devil belongs in hell.",0
Food = OK. \n\nService = What service??,0
The last time I came here for lunch it was a disaster.  The pizza was super slow and when it finally arrived it was burnt.   Decided to give them another try since I was in the neighborhood.   The lunch menu hasn't changed and it still has the same dishes - most of which are pretty heavy for a quick lunch.  You can get a small cheese pizza on the lunch menu but no substitutions so no pepperoni pizza.\n\nThe dining room is pretty dingy but the bar isn't half bad - which is clearly why everyone sits in the bar.\n\nThis time service was much better but the food was so so.  \n\nThis place was one of the first I can recall to serve a white pizza and it was decent.,0
"Went to Red Devil on Bell Rd. yesterday (07/10) for lunch.  \n\nA little background.  I meet my brother and friends once a week for lunch.  We go to a couple of different places, and about 2 months ago put Red Devil into the rotation.  My 9 year old son has been coming with us since school is out for the summer.\n\nThe first time I brought my son w/ me, he was given a customer appreciation card.  He got a free soda, and then every time we come in there, we get the card punched.  After 10 punches, he gets to pick out a fish for their aquarium.  Got his 10 yesterday and picked out a Black Tetra.  Staff has been very nice to him!\n\nSince we have been going there, service has been top notch.  Every server we have has been attentive, knowledgable, and willing to accommodate special requests.  This is a RARE find today.\n\nOn to yesterdays lunch...\n\nRed Devil has some great lunch specials under $10.00  They have several pastas to choose from and all the pasta dishes come w/ either a salad or soup.  They also have a couple of pizza's on the lunch menu for $5.99 (they call it a personal pizza, but it was about a 12\"""" pie).\n\nI have been getting the spaghetti and meat balls lately.  The pasta is thinner than a regular spaghetti and is cooked al dente.  The red sauce; while not as good a mine, is very tasty.  The red sauce is thick and not watery at all.  They give you 2 average size meatballs in the dish.  I have had meatballs at some restaurants that are so dry, you need a glass of water to choke them down.  Not the case here.  The meatballs at Red Devil are very moist and go great w/ the sauce.\n\nAs I stated earlier, the pasta entries on the lunch menu come w/ a side of salad or soup.  I have been getting the salad; it's the standard iceberg lettuce w/ croutons, cucumber, carrot and onion.  What makes it so good is the house made Italian dressing they have to go with it.  The dressing has a very good flavor and they are not skimpy w/ it.\n\nMy son had the personal pizza w/ pepperoni.  Nice sized pizza (no salad w/ this one).  Thin crust NY style and plenty big for lunch.  Every pizza I have had at Red Devil has been good.  This one was no exception.  Sauce was good and had a nice amount of pepperoni on it (about 3 pieces per slice).  The sauce and toppings extended out to within 1/4-1/2 inch of the edge.  \n\nLunches also come w/ house made rolls and real butter.\n\nI have been to Red Devil about 8x in the last 3 months.  The service and food have been good each time.  The lunch specials are a good value and the service has been great.  I hope they don't change a thing!",1
"We never had Red Devil pizza because we thought they didn't deliver, but THEY DO! So we tried them today. We got the same pizza we eat everywhere, which is sausage and pineapple. Let me tell you, we are in LOVE! Hands down, the best pizza yet! We will order there from now on",1
"I walked into Red Devil randomly, I've been past this place a million times, never stopped, but I'm glad I finally did. The service alone deserves 5 stars + and much praise.\n\n I was greeted immediately upon arrival by young man at the host stand. I was looking to sit at the bar, but it was Thursday night and football season, so there were no available seats. The young man not only walked around the bar to see if anything was available, but also searched around the restaurant to see if he could find me stool to squeeze in. He insisted I sit at one of the 3 large, patron-less booths in the bar area even though I was a party of one. Being in the business myself, I was hesitant, I didn't want a server to lose out to a party of 6 that could comfortably sit in this booth.\n\nAmber was my server. Amber was phenomenal. She greeted me with a comforting and inviting smile. I immediately told her I would move if she had other opportunities for the table, she insisted I stay even after room at the bar  opened up. Amber rattled off the specials with ease, ($2 pints, some good ones too, as  well other great specials during NFL games) gave great suggestions when I was between items ( I had fried zucchini there and a build your own calzone to go) and was amazingly, on top keeping my beer full, and making sure I had everything I needed. Again, I'll say Amber hit the nail on the head with her hospitality. \n\nThe restaurant is huge, clean, and inviting. The food was great, as was the atmosphere. Everyone had a smile on their face and was eager to help. Those are the reasons I'll be back, as well as sending many others their way. Ask for Amber! \n\nKudos Red Devil Bell Rd, and of course Amber, thank you for a great experience.",1
"I'm hanging my head in shame as I open this review with full disclosure...I've lived in the Valley all my life which, so far, has been about, oh, let's say forty-eleven years. I've been aware of Red Devil since the 70's, but I've always lived on the west side and had never visited before. Making plans with my Bestie, I decided this would be the day. We were going to a movie in Scottsdale anyway; let's have lunch at the original McDowell location....except the website sez they don't open until 3:00 on Sundays. Drats! Backup plan: visit the one on Bell Road!\n\nGreeted and seated without delay in a friendly fashion. Major props to Amber for excellent service throughout.\n\nThe bruschetta appetizer was huge. I expected, perhaps, 4 thin slices; this order was the size of Cleveland! Fresh tomatoes, fresh garlic, fat bread - deliciously presented.\n\nI would not have guessed that the soup of the day at an Italian joint might be clam chowder. Let that be a lesson to me, and yes, it was mighty tasty.\n\nB's order was pasta with white clam sauce. It comes with about 475 clams and just as much garlic as you care to request. Manna from heaven.\n\nI had seafood marinara with linguine. The sauce was perfect - not too thin or thick. Several Olympic-sized shrimp, and scallops one could shoot hoops with. My parting comment about the clams above? Oh, yeah, this, too.\n\nEnormous portions. We didn't finish anything and took all of the rest to go. In order to pay penance for all those years I neglected to visit (and because I live 60 miles away and have no idea when I'll be back), we ordered a pizza to take with us. Everything else is delicious; how would you expect the pizza to be? Thaaaat's right...",1
"You can't go wrong using these guys!  They fix all you electrical and Data problems.  They work on huge projects but they still care about the little ones too! Don't feel like your wasting their time for such a small job.  They will be there on time and will have the solution your looking for!  I highly recommend this company, and after you use them-you'll see why!",1
"It is no secret that I am not very handy around the house.  I like to tinker but when electricity is involved I tend to not deal with it.  So, when my backyard floodlights weren't working, I knew I needed professional help.\n\nAfter a quick Yelp search I found Micor and decided to give them a call based solely on their reviews.  They sent a person out to my house within a half hour and had my lights working not long after.\n\nThe best part is that I wasn't even home.  I arranged it all from my workplace.  Sure it was a little bit sketchy having a stranger in my backyard doing god knows what because of a problem I probably described poorly.....but it all turned out ok.  I tested the light after I got home then called their office to pay.\n\nI hope I don't have any electrical problems in the future, but if I do I will call Micor.",1
"HOW does this walmart of wedding dresses stay in business? As Luckie mentioned you set up the appt, yada, yada. I went 2 years ago with my best friend and not only did the sales person let us know we were wasting her time she also told us over and over we were picking the wrong style for her 'beach wedding'. She brought us about 5 different dresses that were the exact opposite of what we asked for. It was horrible! \n\nRecently I revisited looking for a cheap evening gown. Only bonus: everything is in stock so you can try on the actual dress despite your size. HOWEVER, going in and asking for a specific dress they don't have? FORGET it! The girl sent to help me told me that not only did they not have the style, the only way I could get it was if I paid in full ahead of time, and it was NON RETURNABLE! Even if I never brought it out of the store!! Calling other locations to see if they had it was a major hassle for the girl, thanks, no thanks, bye bye!",0
"Price reflects quality and service.  5/2010 purchased wedding gown, brides maids and mothers (bride and groom mothers and grandmothers) dresses.  Girls were rude and our brides maids dresses seems and straps fell apart just before the wedding.",0
"Let me first start by saying that I am only through the process of putting my dress on layaway. So, I can't speak for quality as I haven't worn it for any length of time. I did thoroughly inspect it and am very pleased.\n\nI was thrilled today when I was able to find a dress in my size as I'm a plus-size bride. Not only did I find one, but there was a large selection in my size and I loved a couple of them. Shocking! I don't usually have many choices. \n\nI had called ahead and made my appointment and asked if they had an assortment of dresses in my size in. She said they did and was very kind. I advised her I've been reading horror stories online about plus sized girls being treated poorly, etc by stores and attendants. She assured me that would not be the case. \n\nIt most certainly wasn't. My specialist was amazing. I picked out three I liked hanging on the rack. It's hard to tell what they look like til you have them out and on. I liked one, thought it might be it. Quickly ruled out the other two. Then, she said WAIT, and went and got one that had just come in. It slid on with ease and felt amazing. She knew based on all the information I had given her what I was looking for. \n\nI cannot stress enough how pleasantly surprised I am. \n\nI would advise any bride call ahead as I did. It just gives them the heads up to be extra nice to you if you express concern before hand.\n\nAs someone else mentioned there was no big upsell. No pressure. She told me there was sale on the dress I wasn't aware of. She seemed genuinely interested in my happiness. \n\nWIN!",1
"This place was just... okay. First I'd like to say that my bridal consultant (don't remember her name - sorry) was really nice and helpful. But to me most of the other saleswomen had \""""desperation\"""" all over their faces (don't know if they work off of commission, or if the higher ups are just slave laborers, or what, but I'm sure some of them would've killed for a sale). I found a few dresses I liked, but they were way too high pressure for me to be able to make a solid decision on the spot, so I decided to wait on it. I ended up finding a dress I liked better for about 1/3 of the price somewhere else. I notified David's Bridal \""""thanks but no thanks\"""" about 6 months ago. To this day I still get calls to my cell phone asking me to \""""come back in and try on the dress\""""... they're like the telemarketers of the bridal world! So annoying. Plus their accessories are so expensive, and very cookie cutter. I'd go somewhere else, unless you're new to this and need some ideas.",0
"While the sales girl was very friendly, she didn't actually listen to anything I said. I had printed out pictures of about 12 dresses in styles that I liked, but every dress she brought me was something that I didn't like. She seemed genuinely sorry that they didn't carry more styles in my size. Overall, I wasn't especially impressed by the service or the store and won't be back.",0
My sister ended up buying her dress from here but I was the one doing all the work.  They did not have any dress's pulled even though we had picked a ton of dresses online prior to our visit.  Staff was not good and very unprofessional looking employees.  Do not go to the PV location go somewhere else.,0
"I recently visited the David's Bridal Paradise Valley store while visiting my future in-laws after Christmas. My future mother-in-law really wanted to be involved in the dress shopping experience so I thought I would make my first shopping trip while visiting her. My future sister-in-law was in town too so I thought it would be a nice chance for her to be involved too. I didn't expect to find my dress as I am SUPER picky and it has taken me MONTHS to find dresses for things before. My wedding isn't until October, so I had 10 months and wasn't too worried. \n\nWhen I called to make the reservation for an appt at the Scottsdale store, I was diverted to the Paradise Valley store as the Scottsdale location was under renovation. Not a big deal as the PV store is only 20 min away. I had a terrible experience with Sierra at the PV store. They had warned me that the she would have another client, and I had informed my future mother-in-law and my aunt of this as well. It took her about 20 minutes to come greet me at the front of the store. I didn't try on my first dress until I was 45 minutes into the appointment. Sierra had pulled dresses for me but I was standing there in the slip and corset top they had me put on for 10 minutes before I gave up on waiting for her and had my aunt help me into the first dress. It was a Vera Wang I had been interested in, but I looked like a cream puff (not David's Bridal or Sierra's fault... just not a good look for me). I tried on only one of the other dresses Sierra had brought out of the 4 because I didn't like the dresses she pulled. I kept waiting for her to help me; however, Sierra barely ever came back. She only seemed to come back when she was requested and only helped me in and out of one dress.\n\nI had told her exactly what I didn't want and she kept bringing stuff that had things I didn't want. She was VERY NICE, VERY PROFESSIONAL, and handled my relatives without getting frustrated. However, they were frustrated with her. My future mother-in-law had to pull a lot of the dresses, and most of her pulls were ones I actually liked. Most of Sierra's pulls were ones I did not. She pulled some silhouettes that were nice but nothing that wowed me or really impressed me.\n\nThe dressing room wasn't big enough for the dress, much less the dress and two people. The store itself looked unimpressive. Sierra just was not a good match for me. They didn't have the Melissa Sweet line which was my fav dress when looking through magazines, but Sierra told me the Scottsdale store had the line but probably not the dress. She didn't take the 2 minutes out to call and check for me, but I did.  They had it and accommodated a walk-in. The Scottsdale store set me up with Alison and she was amazing. Even though she too had another client, she made me feel like her only client and she was SO sweet and nice. I really appreciated her and everything she did for me! Because of Alison, I found my dress (turns out the Melissa Sweet I loved wasn't it either) and I ACTUALLY feel like a bride now.  I recommend going to the Scottsdale Fashion Square store EVEN IF THE Paradise Valley store is closer. The rooms are bigger, nicer, and the seating is more comfortable for your family. They have mirrors IN THE ROOMS and the selection is much nicer. The store appears smaller than the PV store but it is SO MUCH nicer than the PV store. Trust me, you won't regret skipping PV and going straight to Scottsdale.  (Ask for Alison too! :))",0
"To be honest, I wasn't expecting amazing at David's Bridal but my recent visit was worst than expected. My sister is on the hunt for a wedding dress and wanted to check out a few she liked online in store. This was her first ever appointment and she came with her mini entourage (me included of course). As we arrived, we were greeted but it took a while for someone to take us back to fittings. It was quite awkward standing in the middle of the store with no direction or place to sit while we waited..\n\nThis is when the appointment got slightly better. Our consultant was very sweet but double booked. It was fun getting to see all the different brides trying on their dresses and having those \""""a-ha\"""" moments with what they liked but not so fun waiting 10-15 minutes for my sister to get her undergarments and then another 10-15 minutes just to try dresses on. At one point, I was in there tying her up into dresses because the consultant was busy. By the way, those dressing rooms are TINY for a bridal store!! Wow, two people were pretty squishy in there plus trying on dresses. I wish they would have given each bride her special time rather than squeeze people into time slots. The consultant was very knowledgeable about the dresses and picked many styles my sister wanted to try on. For our 2 hour appointment, she was able to try on about 10 dresses, which was great to see her in so many styles.\n\nTo make a long story short, she did find a beautiful dress but wants to keep looking. I will say David's Bridal is nice for lower budget options and for brides who need a dress quickly.",0
"I went here the other day to help my friend find a wedding dress. When we first got there we checked in and then were told that our helper (can't remember her name) was finishing up with some other clients and to take a look around. We were told to flip the dresses that we wanted outward instead of taking them out ourselves. We walked around for nearly 15 minutes after the appointment was booked.\n\nFinally the helper came over...but by this time someone had put some of the dresses back to normal because obviously on a Sunday we weren't the only ladies there. So that was frustrating. \n\nNext, it turned out they had barely any dresses in her size - what kind of bridal store doesn't carry a good range of dress sizes (she is not unsually small or large)? I surely didn't expect that. She pulled one dress for my friend to try on...which she ended up not liking (not their fault, of course).\n\nThen our helper dissapeared for 20 minutes. Because she had only pulled one dress we were just standing around. She had, I believe, more than 2 brides booked, which is silly because this is for their special day, you should make your customers feel good and that you appreciate them. I finally had to go tell a manager because I couldn't even find the helper in the store. \n\nThe good thing here is that the manager came over herself, with the helper, and helped to pull dresses - THIS is why they get 2 stars instead of 1 because at least she tried to help the situation and listened to my concerns. \n\nHowever, even despite my friend showing her photos of what she was interested in (the poufy type fairy tale dress that is very common) she kept pulling dresses that were SO OFF of what she wanted. She didn't make the bride or any of the rest of us feel good about shopping there at all.  They also kept showing her dresses WAY above her budget!\n\nSo we left feeling completely unsatisfied. It was nice that the manager tried to fix the situation but it still didn't help. \n\nWe ended up at Adore Bridal boutique, where the consigned dresses are listed by size and she found the perfect dress.",0
"I have to say, after going to several bridal shops, this David's Bridal was the absolute worst. This was the first place I went to try on dresses. I went with my mom on a Wednesday afternoon a couple months ago. The store was totally empty except for us and I had an appointment. The girl who was helping us pulled out some of the dresses I had marked online. She also gave me a special bra for the fitting...but she gave me the wrong size and did not tell me it was the wrong size (I thought I was shrinking!) because they didn't have my size. Really? It is a VERY common size. So, that alone made the dresses look weird. So I tried on a couple dresses, but wasn't really feeling them. I asked the girl (Meghan, I think) if she knew of any nontraditional or funky dresses I could try on and she brought out a few things, but they just were not my style. She didn't spend the time talking to me or looking at my picks from the internet to know what I wanted. Throughout this process, the sales lady would disappear for periods of time (don't know to where considering the store was empty) and I would have to sit around waiting. Then, I asked if I could try on a Vera Wang dress, and she informed me that they only had it in a size 4 (I'm a bridal size 8). I asked her if I could just slip it on open to get an idea of what it would look like. She refused. She held it up to me on the hanger, but would not let me set foot in it. Ridiculous! This sure as hell is not the way to sell dresses. After that move, I was done. I was totally insulted and didn't find anything special anyway, so I moved on. I would not recommend this to anyone.",0
"Ugg the worst costumer service EVER!! And not only this place... They do not hire any competent people what so ever... even their managers. I had to order a bridesmaid dress since the girl at the Tucson location was incompetent. After 4 days passed its supposed arrival (wedding approaching in a week), and not receiving it (freaking out), I called to see where it could be. Called at 11 am for the mailing tracking number... it took the manager until 8pm!!! to get back to me for a freaking tracking number. On top of that, they ended up sending me two of the same dress... just so I can keep dealing with these morons.",0
"So first off you need to make an appointment for David's Bridal really? So I called and scheduled an appointment for 5:30 on a Weds eve I arrive at 5:30 &/ told them I had made an appointment first they couldn't find it then they said oh never mind we did & by the way you're consultant is working with another bride so you will have to wait ? Well why did I make an appointment then I asked ? they took me back and grabbed some dresses for me to try on and the girl didn't even help I got the gowns on myself so why do we need appointment? I think this place is trying to compete in a market of giving great customer service where they failed miserably the girl told me after I was there 10 min she was off in 30 min but no rush ? So why tell me then you're off when I had scheduled appointment and had to wait very disrespectful of my time not helpful i would not recommend. If I was their corporate office I would rethink things they need to be more walk in friendly and respectful of people's time , I will give them their prices are great for brides on a budget and do have beautiful dresses but customer service lacks and that's huge for me . I'm still in search for my dress I did find one I liked there but won't purchase unless I get a discount for my experience .",0
"We ordered bridesmaids dresses, and they came 3 months late, and in the wrong color. We then set up appointments for alterations. When we went in for alterations, we were told that they didn't have time to do it, and to go to another store. We were then given a ton of attitude by the staff, and were denied a chance to speak with a manager. Since then, they've added us to some sort of call list, where their 800 number calls us 6 times a day, and hangs up. \n\nI wish I could give them 0 stars.",0
"I am really disappointed with the service and experience I had with this David's Bridal. Today I went in for shoes for my bridesmaids and the help I received was interrupted and just bad. They only had 3 of the 7 sizes I needed and when I asked questions regarding ordering them, their future shipments, etc. I got \""""unsure answers\"""". I was frustrated but understood them not having all the sizes I needed. When I pressed for how I was going to obtain them, she never offered helpful information. It was only after I asked do other stores ship them to your location? No. Are you getting more in? Not sure. If other stores have them and I cannot drive there is there an option? It will be $15 to get them shipped per shoe/store. This was not great information or service. She gave me a list of a few locations that had some of the sizes but did not offer to call them to confirm. I left feeling unimpressed.\n\nLater, I called the stores she gave me and 2 of them did not have the sizes in stock that I was told. Now, I work in retail so I know your onhands can sometimes be off, but this disappointment could have been halted if she would have called to verify herself. I finally got a very helpful, friendly associate at the Avondale location (Jessica) and she did not have the shoes either (like the first associate said again) but she gave me options right away. She confirmed that she could ORDER the shoes and get them shipped to my closest location or to my house. An option I never heard from the Tatum location! I was happy to do this, and I even paid the one time $15 dollar fee to get them shipped to my house to avoid going back to the Tatum location and dealing with that horrible service. When Jessica was processing my order, she even made a remark that they didn't fill out any of my information correctly in the system and had to do a whole profile with me over the phone; even though I had been to the Tatum location twice (and purchased items both times). \n\nI wasn't going to put the employees name that helped me because I did not want to be rude, but please ensure management revisits training and what great service looks like with the employees working today, Saturday. I am not looking forward to picking up the shoes I already ordered... I hope I have a better experience then.",0
"I walked into the Paradise Valley location on a whim one wednesday afternoon. No customers were in the store. The girl at the front told me to let her know if I needed to try something on. When I found something the girl up front was nowhere to be found. Someone else saw me but ignoredme. I had to ask someone for help. That girl sent a young girl to open the dressing room for me. I found her to be cold, phony and not enthused. The room was tiny and could barely fit me (i am 95pounds) and the dress together. When I came out the girl was gone. I stood there in the dress for several minutes. When she finally came over, she saw that this size four dress was swimming on my size two body but never took the initiative of pinning it. I had to ASK her to pin it. Cmon, do your job. I tried on another one and came out and again she was gone. I stood there with the dress swimming on me for several minutes til I decided the hell with this. I took the dress off, left it hanging in the dressing room and walked out of the store without anyone even knowing I left because once again, NO ONE WAS AROUND IN THIS EMPTY STORE! Common theme in these reviews. Do something about your lack of customer service because not many people will ever recommend this store.",0
"Scheduled an appointment at the expo to just look at dresses. I received a confirmation for Sunday at 12:30 and we went. The experience wasn't that great. We tried both bridesmaids dresses and wedding dresses. I have to give credit to the lady that was assigned to us. She was helpful to the extent she could be. They had obviously overbooked and so the only time she had available was to take our dresses, hang them up, and give us rooms. She was nice but waaaayyyy overworked. We didn't need much help with the bridesmaids dresses, but when it came to the wedding dress, it was difficult because I had to wait to be given different dresses. Not all fit in the tiny room they give you. At one point I had to wait naked for awhile because the corset didn't fit and I had to ask my girls to hunt the assistant down to get a new one. My initial dresses didn't fit just because the large corset underneath, but rather than noticing the pucker, she just clamped me up. At one point I was switching the dresses out myself. I completely blame management for overbooking. On top of that the dress I did want was 'on sale' for $550. With the discount from their advertised sale it would have been $500. Looking online it was available at $500 on their website and a plethora of other websites (so no great deal.) will not go here again or suggest anyone else do so. Will go to another location and definitely a different day of week.",0
"I live in NY but my wedding is in Phoenix. Since I found my dress at a lovely David's Bridal in New York, I assumed I would have a wonderful experience here - boy was I wrong.\n\nI made an hour long appointment to shop my Matron of Honor's dress, a flower girl dress, and dresses for my mother and MIL. \n\nI arrived for my appointment on time and had to wait 15 minutes before my consultant came over. We picked out all of our dresses in 30 minutes and were told by the consultant that there would be no problem..\n\nWell that was a lie...\n\nMy MOH dress couldn't come in Iris unless we got it from the warehouse. The warehouse takes 12 weeks to ship! My wedding dress took 4 weeks, but a bridal party dress takes 12!?! It would arrive 2 days before the wedding, but that was NOT guaranteed. We spent the next hour trying on dresses, despite me asking can you tell me which dresses come in Iris? Every dress we selected didn't come in Iris - finally the manager helped us out and gave us a list of dresses.\n\nAdditionally, the moms picked out dresses and again were told yes they came in the purple they wanted. My mother's and MIL dress didn't even come in purple! They both ended up getting dresses from the bridal party line. Which caused another problem since we couldn't get the purple we wanted.\n\nFinally after 3 hours we were ready to check out. The original consultant had put everything in wrong. My mom was assigned a dress she never tried on. My flower girl's size was incorrect. The purses we were written down not to be dyed (we wanted them purple). It took forever to fix.\n\nNo, I'm sorry were given. No here's a coupon for your trouble. Instead here's a 15 dollar charge per item to ship.\n\nPlease, DO NOT SHOP AT THIS STORE!",0
"I bought the most stunning bridal gown and matching veil at this David's Bridal location. My designer, Ariana, deserves all the credit for finding it for me. She knew what I was looking for and she suggested dresses I didn't even think to try on.  I expected to pay thousands of dollars for such a beautiful and unique designer gown.  Alterations are very affordable, too. The Assistant Manager, Erica, was caring and very helpful and she made sure our experience was nothing short of wonderful. Thank you, Ariana and Erica!  With your help, I found the perfect gown for my special day.  I can't wait for my wedding day!",1
"Let me start off by saying that as soon as I purchased my bridesmaid dress I was no longer assisted in any way possible. It's like as soon as they got their hands on my money, I didn't exist.  I was called about 3 weeks later and was told my dress was ready to be picked up. I went in the next day and the zipper was ripped before I even touched it.  I asked if alterations would be able to come see and assist me and the sales girl rolled her eyes at me.  As soon as alterations came out I showed her that the zipper was clearly ripped and she said yeah I can fix it and walked away, I'm like hello can you stand here minute and see if I need help anywhere else with the dress, and she had already started helping somebody else.  Again I had to hunt down another salesperson for help.  They told me I would have two weeks to pick up my dress after the alterations were done.  Two days later I received a voicemail that my dress would be available to be picked up, so I called back asking if it needed to be picked up tonight or of I still had two weeks, and the person on the phone was like, \"""" I don't know what's going on with your dress, so I don't know what to tell you. \"""" I'm like can you please find out, is this so difficult to verify a simple question and she replied \"""" if that's what they told you, then I guess that's true.\"""" I am completely Unsatisfied with they service at this store.  I work in retail and would never treat a customer the way I have been treated by several of these employees.  I am usually not one to write a yelp review, but I actually signed up for an account to post one because of how horrible the service is here.  The only reason I shopped here is because my friend who lives out of state is having all her bridesmaids purchase here.  She, too, knows about the bad service and will be contacting her location as well. \n\nIf I could give no stars I would. Will be contacting manager and corporate.",0
"I got a \""""low-reg\"""" fade and it was $12. The building says $9.99, but that's for Wednesdays only. They apparently used to have Thursday specials as well, but all the signs have had it removed. I forgot the other prices, I'll probably snap a photo next time.\n\nWent in and was actually surprised that it looked as nice as it did. It's not an elegant, $20 barbershop, but coming from San Diego, I was pleasantly surprised they had something other than cheap seating. It looks like they tried to make it look old school and classic, but tried is the key word. Overall, I dig the feel of this place.\n\nThere was only one barber, a middle-aged Russian (I'm assuming) lady who was friendly. Didn't talk, but I'm not one that likes to converse with barbers, so I prefer this kind of feel - only mentioning it because some people look forward to telling their barbers their life's stories. \n\nI would definitely go back here again. I only knocked off 1 star because at the end she gave me clipper burn cleaning up those pesky bottom neck hairs. Not a huge deal for me to be honest, but it does sting a little bit. However, the fade was so good, I can handle a little weakness leaving my body ;).",1
Creepiest place ever. Didnt even get out of my car after a group of shady people started staring at my in the parking lot. Don't go here.,0

"I ordered a fountain pump from these thieves, and they charged my credit card and never sent me the pump. Further, they then refused to respond to any emails, and I am still trying to get my money back. Do not do business with these people.",0
"They are very unreliable and disorganized\nThey will sell you a part at retail, then charge you to come out to replace it under warranty, but charge for their labor.  Even when they make a faulty installation!  That was dishonest in my opinion.  And, they wouldn't return the install fee even though it was botched!\nAlso, even if you have a warranty problem, they will take weeks to come to your house or business for a quick fix.  Generally its twice: once to look, second to repair, generating a 6 week process(you have to get back in line again).\nthey keep bankers hours; no Saturdays, and close early.\nThey have received other bad reviews because it was complained that they are untrustworthy and unreliable.\nThey did an estimate on a big job that would not have solved the problem(thank the stars for a great concrete company), it only would have been a major expense straight down the drain.. They recommended a new fountain and after taking out the old.  What was needed was a revamp of the concrete and keep the fountain.\nHeather in there front office is tough, unaccommodating, and surly.   Other personnel seem to not to  be with it.\nThey are horrible about returning messages of any kind.  \n\nDon't be fooled.  there are other people who can work on your fountain.",0
"The sign for this place cracks me up.  The jokes go, \""""Hey, it's Pot World.  Wanna get some pot?\"""" And then my friends would giggle like they actually had been ingesting some of that particular substance.  Ok, when I was younger I giggled too.  Ok, sometimes I still giggle.  Whatever.\n\nI felt like we'd been talking about the place long enough that I had to actually go in there.  It was pretty cool.  They do in fact have all kinds of pots.  I'd say at least 85% of them are of the teracotta variety - though size, shape and color are so different that there is still tons of variety.  Prices aren't too bad really for what you're getting.  And folks let us look around a bit more leisurly, which was nice.  \n\nWhere else can you go and look at nothing but pots?  This place beats the heck out of going to Home Depot when working on your container gardening.  You might find exactly what you want.  You might just bring your camera and take a picture of yourself with the sign.",1
Wow! I won't be going here. I called to ask a simple question about whether they carry an item and was treated like I was stupid because I don't know the details of their business or what kind of inventory they carry. If this is how they treat their potential customers on the phone I'm afraid I won't be one of them.,0
"Make sure you really want what you are buying because you can't get your money back!  Only a store credit.  We recently bought a ceramic frog to hang on our wall in the back for decoration.  when we came home our son advised not to hang as it was too heavy.  i called immediately (about 1 hour after we were  at the store) to ask if we could return it since it had only been a short time since we purchased it.  we were told \""""No, store policy is no refunds!!\"""" I said you have not even been to the bank to deposit the cash I gave you.  He said No you can have a store credit but no money back.  I did not want a store credit so I kept the item and have it displayed on the ground.  Make sure you want what you buy because you are kissing your money good-bye!\nReally bad customer service.  Also quite rude when I called.  Buyer beware!!\nIf I could give no stars I would!!",0
"I am so glad I stopped into Home Fabrics!  It is located right next to Discount Tire on 32nd St/Cactus.  Rather than sitting in the tire shop (that smell in tire shops give me a headache), I went over to Home Fabrics.  They sell rugs too, beautiful rugs and the price is amazingly cheap!!  Like $50 -$100 for huge high quality rugs.  I didn't buy one YET, but I plan to head back and pick one up once I decide exactly which one I need.\n\nThe fabrics are an even better deal!  I signed up for their newsletter and email alerts and get info about sales and classes.  I don't know how to sew, but I know how to use a hot glue gun.  Maybe this is my year to learn?",1
"This store gives me mixed feelings. On one hand, it's great that it is so open, on the other, at first glance the store seems empty. After perusing the aisles I decided there was a lot to choose from, but all the fabric seemed to have a similar style. The store sells durable, darker colored fabrics (generally) that have a classical style. The prices are good and it would be easy to use any of the materials for drapes, upholstery, etc., unless this style is not up your alley. I would not go here searching for funky, colorful fabrics for your home!\n\nThe staff is generally helpful if you have any questions, but they can also be a bit snippy (hah... fabric puns). Several times I have asked them for something and they have told me that I was incorrect/looking for the wrong thing. Maybe I was looking for the wrong thing, but I don't want to be told so bluntly!",0
"I am learning to sew, I love the staff at the MESA store",1
"Very spacious, open store. Easy to navigate aisles and admire the different fabrics. Selection is pretty good, found quite a few fabrics I liked. Not much in the way of notions or tools however.\nWas least impressed by the two ladies at the counter who completely ignored me as I walked in and as I left. Seen claims of great customer service in other reviews - this was not my experience at all.\nI will probably still stop by again, but I was far more impressed by Fabric Depot, not too far away on Cave Creek - their selection is positively huge (especially compared to the selection here) which makes it a lot easier to look past their spotty customer service.",0
"Some really great fabrics - some a little strange, admittedly.  But the prices are $10- 15 dollars cheaper per yard at another store I was at, even some of the same fabrics.  Not a lot of staff, but enough to do what was needed.\n\nThey will cut you a swatch (of anything that has more than a yard) from the full width of the fabric. It costs one to two bucks which will be applied to any fabric purchase you make.  Much easier to use than a 2x2 square! \n\nI'll be back!",1

"I love this place.  Its really funny that we all live nearby or grew up nearby and never visited!  Ive driven by it about 5,000 times and never once went in.  Well they finally put up a sign advertising happy hour and wing specials, so I had to go.  Im a wing whore.  The inside was exactly as I had expected.  Old school cowboy bar.  They have a MASSIVE back patio for eating and smoking, complete with Horse Shoes.  \n\nHappy Hour is RETARDED CHEAP.\nApps are normally $3-5.  Cut that in half.\nBottles of domestics are $2.\nMy Vodka Cranberries are like $4.\n\n$5 personal pizza is huge, can easily feed 2 people.  Comes with 2 Toppings.  The wings are huge and delicious.  Well worth the $.30 each happy hour price!\n\nI too have now been there about 30 times in the last 6 months.\n\nIt gets a 5-star rating because its everything I expected and a retardedly good deal.",1
"I'm not even sure where to begin.  This place is so weird!  They call themselves a saloon, and from the outside, that's exactly what it looked like.  They also have a sign out front that says no firearms allowed, but they have some weird iron sculptures of guns on the walls inside.  Strange.\n\nAnyway, we were hungry after work, as usual, so we were looking around for something new and interesting.  After giving up on searching for something closer to our current location, we gave in and decided to give this place a shot.  After all, who can resist cheap food?  I had to stifle laughter when we walked in.  I don't know what it is, but this place gave me the giggles!  We stood at the hostess table for a few minutes before we were acknowledged and then a table was cleared for us.  Our drinks were brought out quickly and then we ordered.  Honey Mustard Chicken Wings and Fried Mushrooms for the both of us to share, and a Turkey and Bacon grilled sandwich for me.\n\nNow, you will be sorely disappointed if you come here expecting any sort of creativity with food.  This is straight up generic as it comes food, but they at least do it right.  The chicken wings were piping hot, meaty, and had a pretty good flavor.  I'd probably order a bolder sauce next time.  The mushrooms were really strange.  They were fried, but their breading was soft, and not crispy at all.  I like the outsides to be crunchy, so they weren't my favorite, but I had plenty of ranch to dip them in and make things better.  Now, when my sandwich came out, I stared at it and was disappointed.  It just looked sad, especially with the straight from the bag wheat bread it was made with.  Let me tell ya, don't judge this book by it's cover.  My sandwich was packed with turkey and simply loaded with delightfully salty, crunchy bacon.  It was a really good sandwich, I'm just sad that I was too full to finish it!  The fries were, well, just fries.\n\nI'll probably come back to this place sometime when we're in the area again.  The food is solid, the service is decent, and you cannot beat the prices.  I think we got a soda, 2 apps, and 2 sandwiches all for under 20 bucks.",1

"My son and i go to Wagon Yard, or atleast used to, about every other Sunday morning for breakfast. Today was the last time. Our waitress, to use the term lightly, was a middle aged, petite woman that looked like she woke up from a hang over. Our drink orders came out and my son noticed that his Dr Pepper tasted like syrup gone bad so we flagged her down and requested something else. I fully realize that this was not her problem, but this was the best thing about our service and food that occured during our visit. I had a breakfast plate that the menu indicated would come with eggs, potatoes, a hamburger patty and toast. My son had a hot pastrami with fries. Nothing to difficult about this order! The plates came out and i asked for tobasco. The waitress went off and got my tobasco and dropped it off a table across the room that didnt request it. We got a laugh out of that. So i ate the majority of my eggs without the normal condiment i enjoy just so they would not get cold. Once she did come within range of our table and i gestured for the tobasco once again i was almost done anyway so it was kind of pointless. Now on to the hamburger patty. I am a bachelor so i am very well versed in what a next day reheated burger patty tastes like. This was not even that good. I asked it be medium. It came out charred, crumbly and just plain bad. My sons pastrami did not appeal to him and i could see that it was undercooked as were the limp mess that were the side of fries. We both gagged our way through this mess. At this point i realized they had completely stiffed me of my breakfast potatoes. We were dropped the tab on the table without ever once being asked how are food was or if we needed anything else. When the waitress came for the ticket to run my card i stopped her and explained that i was jipped the potatoes on the menu and that my burger patty still had the spur marks where the cowboy kicked it she made zero attempt at an apology or providing any sort of customer service. Instead she came back with the bill run at full cost and dropped a stryrafoam carton of potatoes on the table stating she thought i didnt want them to begin with. A strange remark considering they are clearly listed as being part of my brweakfast and i never once requested they be left off. Again no apology was forthcoming. No offer to discount a really bad meal. I have friends in the food service industry and i know they work hard for their tips so i am usually one that gives no less then 20%. In this case i grudgingly paid the bill in full on my card and left a quarter for her troubles. That is about 20 cents more then was deserved. Do yourself a favor and avoid this hysterical mess of bad bar, a bad restaurant and bad people running it. Goodbye Wagon Yard and good riddance.",0
Recently went because I had heard that it was under new ownership and wanted to see if it had changed.  We went a few years ago and the food was good but the service was just ok.  Since the last time we were there the place is clean and everyone is very nice.  We love their food as it is your traditional classic american food.  We look forward to the new volleyball courts and wish the new owners luck.  I recommend the tex burger.,1
"Seriously, the charm of this place is the people. It's been through allot in the last couple of years, changing hands and reverting back to the owner who had it for decades. This last loser stole everything of value, defaced the sign and closed the doors leaving an entire staff of loyal employees jobless because he couldn't get a liquor license. It WILL re-open. The bar tenders know how to pour a good drink, the food is cheap and good but the staff and patrons are like family. Think \""""Cheers\"""" in the west. Can't wait to be able to walk in again and welcome back June and Eliot. :)",1
I honestly diidn't expect much but our waitress was great and the karaoke host made the night very enjoyable. Most importantly cheap drinks :),1
"Im only giving 1 start because I can't give 0.\n\nThe waitress was pleasant and extremely helpful, but not dressed appropriately.\n\nThe Food was inedible. We ordered a Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich and a Steak&Fries. The sandwich was bland, the cottage cheese tasted rancid, and the fries were way overdone. We ordered the steak medium rare, and it came well done, tough, and smothered in pepper (no other flavor at all). When we sent it back, the replacement was Raw inside, and grey. We did not feel safe eating it.\n\nThe manager comp'd the steak (but not the fries!) and we were not thrilled but then it got worse.\n\nAs we were towards the end of the (spectacularly disappointing) meal, a live baby roach ran across my fiance's plate. This is unacceptable and I will be reporting this place to the AZ Department of Health",0
"a whole in the wall bar, but thats why ppl like it. they have karoake nights which is fun and its very laid back, not usually is a big crowd. the bar stuff is nice and the chili is good. they have pool tables, dart, bean toss, and a couple arcade games. pretty cheap as well.",1
"HAHAHA..this was an adventure gone bad.\n\nMy friend and i saw this while we were hanging out. We were hungry and thought....why not, maybe it is a diamond in the rough.\n\nNOPE!!!\n\nit's just rough. The burger i had was bland. no seasoning at all. I've eaten better burgers off a george foreman before... ...\n\nfries were mushy  \n\n\nand it was awkwardly quiet and dead in there.",0
"Call Jon Taffer, this bar needs rescuing!! Hubby and I were out for a birthday adventure day and thought we would try it. Should have turned around as soon as I used the womans room. Filthy, smelled horrid, gross. Felt like pressing my luck so ordered a couple of whiskey and sevens. Holy hell...not sure what well they got their whiskey out of but I couldn't even finish it (and that says a lot!!) Hubby ordered hot pastrami sandwich, he said was fine. That was then. Hubby has spent a lot of time in the bathroom since we've been home, that's all I'm saying. I ordered a 1/2 sandwich with cup of their house vegetable beef soup. The soup was rancid tasting. It had bubbles around the edge?! Ended eating my wonderbread Oscar mayer turkey sandwich and haven't had screaming diarrhea yet....You can be a dive bar without being a nasty bar.",0
First time I have ever seen a roach crawl across the table as dinner was being eaten.,0
"The biggest shock of my recent culinary exploits was that The Wagon yard, a dark dingy looking place I'd passed by a million times would turn out to be not only a place I would enjoy eating, but a place that I would find myself visiting at least three times a month. The first time I stopped in it was almost out of desperation for lack of other close by open breakfast options. When I stepped inside it was exactly what I'd always imagined, dark and divey, with occupants at the bar just before eleven A.M. I was greeted almost immediately ajd told to sit anywhere id like, this wasnt the reception I'd come to expect from similar locations. I found a breakfast menu waiting at the table, the options were what you would expect to find at places like this, \""""two eggs plus this and that\"""" and \""""pancakes and such\"""", the prices? insanely low, Id be so user to eating at overpriced breakfast establishments in Scottsdale so I was delighted to find that this place had full meals for extremely low prices, yet a part of me remained skeptical. I had a two egg platter with sausage and wheat toast. I was shocked that they used real egg, and tasty ingredients. I was in love, the service was quick, honest, down to earth, and all around pleasant.  since my first visit I have been back enough times to fill one of their loyalty cards and treated myself to a ribeye and eggs at a discounted rate, and even then I wasnt let down, the steak was quality and cooked just how I liked it. I'd recommend this place to anyone who, like myself, would never think to give this place a chance. like the saying goes; \"""" you cant judge a book by its cover\"""", visit The Wagon Yard and treat yourself to a pleasant surprise.",1
The last tome I was in I was waiting for my motorcycle to be finished woth service next door. The wings tastes awful and the fries were clearly frozen store bought. The place still smelled like rotten feet. Later that night I got terribly sick and had diarreah for hours. Clearly the chicken had turned. Will not go back! Truly awful!,0
"I'll go ahead and start by making the bold statement that these guys don't care about quality. I have an old Cadillac that was driven by a 90 year old man up until I got the car. The car was in perfect shape until I was rear ended. I decided to take it to auto body world since they're down the street from my house. I made it known on multiple occasions that I wanted the car exactly how it was before the wreck and they assured me that it will \""""look brand new.\"""" I didn't notice how bad it was until I got the car home. Oh, a side note, they bring you your car when \""""finished\"""" and park it in shaded/covered parking so you don't notice their shoddy work. Long story short, there's parts listed on the paperwork that they supposedly bought to replace the damaged parts yet the damaged parts are still on the car. Weird. They replaced chrome parts with plastic and got overspray all over the front of the car. The trim doesn't fit together how it's supposed to and it has bends in it....it's not even flush to the panels. When the trunk was hit the latches were bent severely and they just did their best to bend them back even though they needed to be replaced. The most annoying thing....when I open the trunk it's supposed to open all the way without having to touch it.... It now only opens a quarter of the way. And, conveniently, all of the sudden the interior left speakers don't work anymore. They certainly did when I dropped the car off. WTF! If you want your car to look like it came out of Maaco then go to Auto Body World.",0
Ask for Jonathon or his wife.  They are the owners and do an excellent job.,1
"I went to Bella Nails on a suggestion from a friend who told me how good their prices are. $10 for a mani, $16 for a pedi, and $25 for a mani/ pedi. I wasn't expecting much for the price.\n\nThe atmosphere isn't great, the location is iffy, but other than that it was amazing! Very nice staff. My nail tech must have spent about 10 minutes massaging my legs and feet. 1 hour later I still feel like melted butter. I spent half as much as I normally spend for a pedicure but my nail tech gave one of the best pedis I have ever had. \n\nI'm hooked. The wait was pretty long so I'm going to start making twice monthly appointments. Highly recommended.",1
"I have been coming here since I started teaching down the road 5 years ago.  My friend suggested we get a mani/pedi and this place ended up being GREAT!  The staff is very friendly and professional.  They are very up to date with all the new nail services such as gel, shellac, and metallic.  The atmosphere isn't the best (not new), but its still nice.  The prices are amazing and they give the best leg/arm massages ever!!  I come to this place almost every month and have always left very happy!  :-)",1
"My mom and I went in without calling on a Saturday afternoon. They were able to do my mom's pedi and then my gel mani back to back, which worked for us since we like to chat while our nails are being done. \n\nThey didn't have an abundance of polish colors and a lot of them were outdated, but my mom found a color she ended up being really happy with. I'm very happy with the gel French mani I got, but we'll see how long it lasts. \n\nThe shop is clean and the employees are friendly and efficient. The total for both of us was $44. We will definitely go back.",1
I'm sitting here watching them NOT clean my cuticles after I asked them to redo it. Definitely won't be coming back here. How did this place get 4 stars??,0
"Subways are supposed to be very uniform, but this was not. The meat was mediocre, nothing tasted fresh at all. And to top everything off, the employee insulted me, and my clothes, and was hitting on my sister. It was a very unpleasant experience.",0
"I love this location and I am glad it is close to my home. The service is always great and the food fresh and tasty, the friendly staff takes their job seriously and know how to please their customers.",1
"I feel sort of strange reviewing a bank, but it is a place I frequent often so it seems ok to review. Plus, at my old job, my crazy boss dealt with SEVEN different banks of which he had me personally take deposits to each (sometimes on the same day, fun drive...not) so I feel well qualified to judge it in comparison to other banks.\n\nAnyways, on with the review already...I love Desert Schools. I don't see myself ever switching to another bank for any purpose. I have been banking with them for 4 years and have never had even one issue. In fact, they often resolve issues for me, such as removing those nasty little NSF fees. I always have a really pleasant experience when I go in, all of the tellers are super friendly and are well-trained. I also never have to wait in much of a line. \n\nIn comparison to the several other banks I used to deal with, I feel that DS takes the time to educate each of their employees far more than other banks. I also feel as if they don't pressure you to open other services. Many of the the banks that I used to deposit at for my old boss would constantly hound me about opening up another account, or line of credit, etc. \n\nIf anyone talks about bank issues, I always find myself raving about my wonderful banking experiences!!! Thank you Desert Schools for being awesome!",1
we opened several accounts here at desert schools because they are a credit union not a bank\n\nwhat i don't care for is the cold environment\nthe staff are friendly enough and knowledgeable\nservices will do \n\nthe environment though is more cold than one of the big banking institutions\n\ni like they are local to arizona though so we'll stay!,0
"Had a membership savings account with them and didn't use it for some time (it is a savings account afterall!).  After recently taking a look, they had been taking 10 dollars a month from the savings account for limited activity.  They stated we should have received something in the mail notifying us, however, we never did.  We are still trying to get all our money back.  Beware if trying to save money in a savings account!",0
Updated since they did finally give our money back.  Still beware.,0
There is something wrong when you try and use a shared branching system and you are told that you are second rate and will have to wait for all the other customers who are members to be helped before you will be helped,0
"I do not recommend this bank due to terrible customer service, terrible website. Unfortunately I am attached to them at the hip with a mortgage until I can refinance. They literally have the worst bank website I have ever experienced. All you can really do is check balances. It usually takes multiple calls to get anything done. They repeatedly fail to send documents properly likely because they dont know how to properly update addresses. I have called many times to get addresses updated and it always reverts. I get the feeling that the employees dont care. The only reason that I would recommend would be to keep you money in a local bank since the big guys like Wells Fargo, Chase, Citi, JP Morgan etc are crooks. Stick with well rated banks like USAA.",0
"Do not use,  Manager Danielle in the call center is the most rude shady person I have ever talk to in my life.",0
"i'm not sure if this is the walmart branch, but it doesn't matter.  i moved her and opened an account at walmart (which i absolutely despise), but it was close and i don't know the area.  i came here with a cashier's check from my other bank. so for 10 business days i had no money.  so i called a day earlier so i can buy some food and the girl asks the supervisor that if i have proof that the check has cleared then i could access the money. so after some calls i get the proof and when i call back they tell me i can only have a portion of the money. even though it has cleared, i can't even touch my own money.  what bullshit!!!!!!!!!!  because i was new.  who fucking cares if i am new.  if i have money that the check has cleared, then i should be able to use MY money.  total bullshit.  also, when you call each person tells you different information.  i don't think the left hand knows what the right hand is doing in this place.  i plan on finding another institute and will make them give me all cash so this shit does not happen again.",0
"I would for sure give this place and their employees a negative rating.  DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE.  They are for sure people of Walmart.  In less than a month, they have cost us $200 dollars, but won't admit to it, no matter how far you go up the ladder.  None of these people know what the fuck they are doing.  My son now has no birthday present for his birthday tomorrow because these stupid condescending  assholes fucked up and they won't admit it.  No accountability for anything!!!!!!  Even though it was not our fault.  It was CLEARLY their fault.   But they are a bunch of fucking idiots that, combined, don't have an IQ of a wet noodle.  They talk to you like they haven't a clue and just keep repeating the same bullshit over and over.   Which to a logical person should make sense, but not them.  The left hand does not know what the right hand is doing!!!  One employee tells you one thing and next tells you something completely different.  In less than a month, I have closed out my accounts there.  I wouldn't wipe my ass with their ridiculous policies that they think they might know.   Except they don't know shit!!!!!!!!!!  DO FUCKING BANK HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  BOTTOM LINE!!!!!",0
"All my daughter wanted to do wash cash her  friggin' birthday check from her grandparents. And so you know, we tried at two Desert Schools branches!\nYep, that was the major issue that dumbfounded these mental midgets at Desert Schools on a Saturday morning. A lousy $25 dollar check. Why was it so confusing? Because my daughter just turned 12 and according to these idiots at Desert Schools, she wasn't able to cash her check because she didn't have a \""""government issued ID.\"""" What 12 year old kid has a driver's license or state issued ID? NONE!!!\nMaybe I should be more understanding. I'm sure it's the 12 year old girls of the world who are trying to swindle financial institutions out of their hard earned money, 25 dollars at a time.\nDesert Schools, you lost another customer, but more importantly, you really should be ashamed of yourselves for treating children this way!",0
"They're not exactly a model of kind or friendly customer service.\n\nThey rejected me for a checking account. That isn't a problem, it's how they treated me after I was told; like \""""It's time for you to go\"""".\n\nA modicum of decency would have been nice, not getting shuffled out the door.",0
Just nasty! Very cluttered and overpriced.,0
"Workers and sales associates make or break any business..and I was lucky enough to get a great gal to help me a few weeks ago at this Goodwill. I was part of a 'mama gaga' act and I needed to make a Lady Gaga costume. The cable guy was coming to the house and I only had a few minutes to shop for a dress that I could turn into one of Gaga's famous fashion statements. I went to the dress section, which also happened to have an associate hanging up dresses. She asked if I needed help. I told her what I was doing and she took me into the bridal section (which are full brides gowns - great for customs or anyone on budget), she helped me look for a dress in the section she was working and she pointed out one last section where I might be able to find something. Sure enough, I found a dress that I could modify. I couldn't believe how helpful she was; she had worked with a family member doing pageant gowns and gave me some tips to turn my dress into the Gaga fashion statement I was aiming to achieve. I told her she needed a job at a department store, she was so helpful and friendly...and my dress was a hit!",1
"I've never had a bad experience here as far as customer service goes - I'm usually just in and out since I know what I want. I just grab it and pay for it.  However, my low rating is based on what I experienced here recently.  \n\nI attended a wedding this past weekend and decided I was too lazy to do my own makeup and being in a hurry, I just felt like having someone professional do it so that I look extra nice, since it is a wedding.  And what a coincidence that MAC does your makeup for free with a $50 dollar purchase, and I needed to grab some items anyway.  \n\nI arrived 15 minutes before my appointment, at 2:45 pm.  I was greeted really nicely and was told my artist had just arrived.  Very shortly after my artist walked over and greeted me and told me sit in one of the chairs.  She then asked me what kind of look I wanted to achieve, then proceeded to go get the makeup.  I thought so far so good, as I felt I described to her what I wanted overall, but I wasn' t specific to the point as to what exact color I wanted, seeing how she is a \""""make-up artist\"""" and I just trusted she would use what flatters my feautures and skin tone.  \n\nI don't want to drag out the story more than it needs to be - but my exact feelings at the end of the makeup session was that I could've made my self look better than she did.  I asked for a smokey eye, in which she slathered on black and grey eyeshadow and just blended out the edges. There was no definition or depth or any kind of contrast.  I also told her I wanted a cat eye look, in which she proceeded to make me look like an ancient egyptian.  The lines she drew were way too thick, and instead of a subtle \""""wing\"""" at the end of my eyes, she literally I kid you not, literally drew fish hooks.  I was horrified , and told her nicely that maybe the look was a bit too dramatic for a wedding.  She giggled sympathetically and toned down the wings/hooks, but even the toned down look was still super dramatic.  So by then I was just whatever about it, because if I had her wipe off the eyeliner, it would ruin all the other makeup on my face and it would take longer to apply it again, and I was in a crunch for time already.  All the while, ever since she applied the eyeshadows, there was a bunch of fallout on my cheek and below my eye.  I thought to myself she would probably brush it off at one point but she never did.  I pointed it out to her and she said \""""Oh, Okay.\""""  And as she proceeded to attempt to remove the fallout, she giggled and said \""""This is what happens when you try to do things in a hurry.\""""\n  \nUmm..........are you serious?\n\n\nShe spent half the time I was there running around the makeup floor searching for supplies.  From what I gathered, this make up artist was new.  Not sure if she is just new to this location or new as a makeup artist in general - though my instincts point toward the latter.  Even if she was new to the business - like seriously, people who do makeup tutorials on youtube do a better job. Whoever deemed her acceptable as a makeup artist should seriously have their own license revoked.  \n\nI was very disappointed with my face when she finished.  I looked like I was going clubbing.  In ancient Egypt.  Even when I go clubbing, I don't put on that much makeup.",0

Well we could not find them because of inadequate signs and we asked an employee who told us where they were. She failed to mention that they too were closed and we would have to walk again to get to some working restrooms. By this point my son is literally dancing because the new, not opened restrooms were quite a walk from the front of the store. We finally get to the restrooms and my son tells me that he does not even want to go in there because it was so filthy. The restroom was absolutely unacceptable. \n\nI decided to call the number on the wall to make a complaint but was unsuccessful because the number was out of service. It takes me 15 minutes to track down a manager. This idiot was the rudest person I have ever met. As I was speaking to him he started to walk away from and I just about lost it.

Today, I practically watched a ghetto women beat her children and scream at them bc she wanted to check herself out in a pair of walmart's hottest sunglasses and they kids wouldn't stop asking her questions. It was so bad that my daughter told me she was scared. Customers were staring, the employees did nothing. So embarrassing. The remodel is most likely going to look great when finished ...

"I generally like Walmart far more than I should and defend their sourcing ethics and quality far more than I'd like - that said, there are some real jerks working at this particular Wal-Mart, including the cart caretaker, the frozen foods produce wench, and the dude haphazardly chucking heads of lettuce into a bin to ensure their short shelf life.  \n\nDon't get me wrong folks, I know your job sucks, but at leas try not to make the customers shopping with you feel bad about their decisions.",0
"Closest to home and LAST CHOICE when I need to shop WalMart -- I WILL go OUT OF MY WAY to avoid this store whenever I possibly can and you should too!  \n\nThis store is on the center of a middle/upper-middle class area and it's run as if it's in a war zone.  The impression I get is almost complete apathy and disorganization -- that no one cares and/or no one gives a damn.\n\nThey got me with their \""""one stop shopping\"""", but in the end it's not worth it and I'm starting to spend more and more time and money at Costco, Home Depot, Target, Macy's, Sprouts, and Fry's, etc, etc.\n\nThe worst part is that there are 6-8 associates and 1-2 managers that I encounter regularly and are really, really nice and really trying to do a good job.  My heart goes out to them.  And they're the ONLY reason this store gets 2 stars from me and not just 1!\n\nAnd the only reason I'm filing such a scathing review is in hopes that someone in management will take notice and do something.  You can see from my other reviews that I'd rather rave about great experiences than complain, LoL!\n\nHere we go!\n\n1. I have 2 qualified service dogs and was accosted on one visit by one \""""greeter\"""" who demanded to see their \""""papers\"""" and told me that if they bit someone we (WalMart) won't be responsible.  These are 2 toy Yorkies who were sitting calmly in my cart as I entered.  When i told him politely but firmly that there is no such thing as \""""papers\"""" for service dogs and that it was against federal law and store policy for him to ask, he called the undercover security guard who was also very rude.  I tried to call the number posted on the door for just such an occasion but it took me to a complete dead end on their phone system\n2. Store is FILTHY most of the time -- except the one time that I could clearly see that there was a group of VIPs touring the store from corporate that day\n3. I observed one jewelry counter associate being so incredibly rude to a customers it almost brought tears to my eyes and I had the complain (the customers themselves seemed a bit intimidated, they were not \""""native\"""" English speakers)\n4. BIG, BIG disparity in service level -- some associates are SO nice and some are soooo rude!  I know it's WalMart but if management is doing its job...  Oh, no!  I forgot, IT WAS MANAGEMENT -- 2x -- that was rude to the point of hostility!\n5. Basic items out of stock for MONTHS! What's wrong with their forcasting system???  Just a few examples: Smart Balance margarine (3# size), Great Value Parmesan cheese (all sizes), Arrowhead water (1 gal), Huggies Naturals wipes, OUT Puppy Pads (size varies), and more. And this is not after a busy weekend, this is Tue afternoon, etc.  I found all these items at the next 2 closest WM stores, so they ARE available from their warehouse.\n6.  Premium items (e.g., Evian water (6pk), Ghirardelli chocolate chips, etc with no shelf tags (not priced).  This is consistent with the few higher end items they do carry\n7. So called Supercenter doesn't even stock a few bottles of Perrier or Pelligrino (or substitute); other WMs in Phoenix do\n8.  GREEN meat in case still for sale -- it was marked down, but come on!\n9.  Other reduced food that's obviously spoiled (e.g., wilted, browning veggies)\n10. Items that are marked down in every other nearby store in the city that I've visited (about 6) have still not been marked down at this store\n11. 1/2 off bakery items after 1 pm -- even though they've been re-ticketed with a new UPC, it's up to the cashier to remember to take 1/2 off at the register - do you think they forget sometimes?  And no option for customers to do it at the self-check (and no instructions to ask or remind the cashier)\n12. More expensive packages of meat stocked in the slot labeled for the less expensive cuts and/or smaller packages\n13. Site-to-Store online order pick up system -- a complete circus, don't bother!  I spent over an hour trying to pick up 2 items that were sold online as \""""READY for pick up TODAY\"""" and was insulted by front end managers and patronized by the assistant store manager\n14. Ladies room disgusting mid-day, mid-week (i.e., not an especially busy time)\n15. Store is uncomfortably cold in the grocery area and uncomfortably hot at the other end - I've never experienced this at any other WalMart, Target, etc with a similar setup\n16. Consistantly out of disinfectant wipes at the doors -- even at off peak days and times\n17. Guest/partner vendors allowed to harass customers (COX subscription sales)\n\nThe list goes on. And on,  And on....\n\nI've reported some of these things to management and was assured that it would be changed (e.g., no instructions about how to get the 1/2 off on bakery) and it never has been.  \n\nIf you're in NE Phoenix, save yourself additional stops and an unpleasant experience and shop at the Tatum and Cactus store, which has improved A LOT -- or better still go to Northsight, which is always a good experience!\n\nDon't say I didn't warn you! ;-)",0
"I also would never step inside a Walmart but could not resist the $99 iPhone sale. I'll give them one star as most people seemed well intended. But I was amazed at how poor the service was. It took almost 45 minutes to purchase a phone because the manager helping us didn't have authority to log in to the main computer. The store was severely understaffed. Several workers had their shirts half tucked in. Their walkies on blast. Workers yelling down aisles. Zero sense of urgency to complete a sale. Our salesperson repeatedly shared that he hated the iPhone (that I was intending to purchase). I could never imagine this conversation at Best Buy. \n\nI wasn't going to report this ridiculously awful experience because, again, the man helping me meant well. I place 100% of the blame on upper level management not trusting their staff, poor training, not investing in their staff's well being & not passing on authority to put customers first. \n\nWhen I purchased my iPhone, I asked that the terms of my data plan not be altered. They assured me several times that it would not. When I got home, I learned that actually they had changed my plan and it took two days of speaking with AT&T to revert back (my plan is amazing and no longer offered). After the unnecessary headache of getting my plan reinstated, I thought it important to leave a review. \n\nI'm very happy with my phone, certainly at this price, but if at all possible stay far away from this store. At least until Walmart starts training and supporting their staff properly.",0
"Worst customer service!!!!  Went to return a storage box that did not fit our Christmas tree.  When the sales associate saw the box she automatically said its non refundable and it was a clearance item because it was a Christmas item.  I told her that it was not on clearance and it was not a Christmas item.  I even told her it doesn't say anything on the receipt.  She said \""""It doesn't matter\"""".  So finally she went to a manager and the manager said that it was not a Christmas item and can absolutely be returned for a full refund.  I think the employees should be educated on what can be returned and what can't.  Another thing is she should have dropped the attitude right from the beginning.  So if anyone needs to return something to this location,  see a manger first and avoid dealing with an associate who is rude and doesn't know what they are talking about.",0
"Horrible customer service. There are so many people working here and when you need their help, they aren't there to help and make you wait for them. I hate coming to walmart for this reason!",0
Has this place ever heard of a mop? The floors are FILTHY! Can't you hire somebody to mop the floors? Every floor in this place was filthy. ALL OVER THE STORE!!!!!,0

"You may say to yourself someday, \""""Self, I swore I'd never return to this Walmart, but I am right by it and need to get a - insert product here - that they do carry at the cheapest price, so I'll just...\"""" Just Stop.  Drive further, even if it grows your carbon footprint, even if it costs more.\n\nWe'll start with the parking lot.  You WILL almost be hit by someone before you park.  There's always a group of employees congregated by the door on smoke break.  They look miserable.\n\nThen there's the overall atmosphere.  Quiet, like a warehouse.  No smiles, not even on employees' faces.  Even though it's the middle of the day, it's not crowded, making you wonder what's wrong and a bit scared for yourself.\n\nProduct availability is akin to what I imagine it was like in Communist Russia.  Lots of empty space on shelves and the most common basics you need might not be there...like romaine lettuce, for example.  There's a good chance you'll have to go to another store after shopping here because Walmart didn't have it.\n\nWalmart's prices are no lower than anyone else's overall.  They wanted $1.99 a pound for a whole chicken that I ended up buying at Trader Joe's for $1.29 a pound...for an organic chicken.\n\nWe haven't even reached the worst part yet.  Checking out.  I stood in a line, 3rd of 4 customers.  Customer 1 was trying to pay with some kind of check that the cashier couldn't identify.  Wait for manager, wait for manager.  Line at dead stop.  During this, Customer 2 with his \""""girl\"""" and baby was yelling into his cell phone how he \""""can't hang right now because I'm at the Walmart with my girl and baby...\"""".  Cashier still waiting for manager, holding check up to the light as if it's going to show her a hidden Presidential face to prove its authenticity. \n\nIt's got to be more than a coincidence that the rapid rise in antidepressant use happened right about when Walmart went national in the U.S.\n\nDon't go here.  Go somewhere happy.",0
"I would put negative star if available. The workers their are so rude ave are not costumer friendly.  Not to mention they don't even know their own merchandise.  There's a little crazy foreign last who works in their dressing room who needs to be fired.  Rudest old lady ever! Their management needs to be replaced,  if their employees can treat people like that.   I hate shopping there but when your on a budget,  you have no other choice.  Thumbs down twice!",0
This walmart is definitely a total shit and some of the employees suck.u can't find anything here also I went @8 pm to buy a cake and there was no one at that counter.they also closes their customer service center @10 pm.if u go at 10.01 pm u will find it close.how punctual they are!!then why it is written that they provide 24/7 customer service.. Ughhh..,0
"I try to understand why people can be so rude. But to be rude over and over again is just unacceptable.  You have to be great full you have a job.   My boyfriend and I went to go return something,  thinking it was 24/ 7 customer service environment,  this lady that seemed to have been working the customer service desk, walked by us, gave us a really snotty answer and said it's closed. This was after waiting 30 MINUTES  to get someone to the electronic area. We hand to hunt down workers 2 times. Finally, got some one to help us, and ended up waiting longer after we asked to speak to the manager about the attitude, and the waiting for a worker to assist us. He was very polite, I wish I knew his name because He Deserves to be recognized.  How ever, all the cashiers seem to have the worst days ever. I don't know why? I feel like the customers seem way happier than the employees, and that... that is strange! \n\nAnother day my boyfriend went in to purchase a new razor. This was around 10 pm. The razor was in the lock box. So he asked an associate to help. The associat went to grab some one and no one came.... then, he saw another associat,  asked to get someone with a key, that associat located someone with the keys... and... the lady told him.. I can't find the key, walked away and never came back. He waited 15 minutes thinking someone would be coming back with the appropriate key.\n. NOPE.  Let's just say, our well earned money won't be spent at this location any more. I hope the employees realize that there life can get much more worst, and hope they know they are worth a smile. It would look better on there faces!",0
I came in for motor oil and spark plugs and learned 3 different languages and may have contracted the Eboli while there.,0
"So I'm picking up an item at the Site to Store and this place is a disorganized cluster fuck. Nobody knows where anything is, got the email this morning saying the item was here but nobody can find it. Managers are rude and store employees are yelling and cursing at each other. Avoid at all costs.",0
We've gone to this Walmart a few times. On our last visit the store was in such disarray that we couldn't find what we were looking.,0
"Just moved to this area and decided to come here for some grocery shopping. It was one of the smallest unorganized walmart I have been to. 2 people can barely get around one another in the same aisle when going opposite directions. Parking wasn't bad. Clean as any other walmart. Won't be back, luckily there's no shortage of grocery stores",0
"Every single time I walk into the walmart at bell/tatum I regret it.  3pm on a Wed. Customer service has 13 people in line. Walked in the door to 8 people in line. The front end manager, Sheila, told me rudely to move and stop blocking traffic in the aisle. However once we blocked traffic they found 2 more cashiers for this nightmarish line. Always worth it to go to a walmart further from home over this one.",0
"Nice guy behind the counter, but very stingy on the meat. I asked for 2 dishes, both \""""Large\"""" meaning extra meat but it still was paltry. I asked for a meat/chicken combo w/brown rice and he got it right. I also asked for a large white meat chicken with NO rice, but more veggies. I guess that was too complicated.\n\nBoth dishes served in a plastic bowl 5/6th full of rice, a thin layer of veggies and a thinner layer of meat.\n\nIt took exactly 75 seconds for my order to be passed to me. If this was McDonald's , that'd be normal.  For a teriyaki place, that's an obvious indication of 'pre-cookery' so who knows how long ago the meat was made.\n\nI just moved here and I really hope this isn't the best Teriyaki this area has to offer.\nI also got some chicken wrap thing, which was actually pretty good, well 2 of them as that was my own \""""delivery reward\"""".\nPaid $19 for the entire order.\n\nI won't go back since I'm not into paying all that $$ for a huge bowl of rice and very little meat.\n\nThis place would not last 1 week in Seattle.

"I remember going to Sam's back in the day in Vegas and it was a fresh, easy fast-food spot. Yeah, not anymore - at least not this one. We walked in and the place looked like a strip-mall Chinese food place that hadn't been updated in decades and we wondered what had happened. The place was dirty. You can't see where the food is made, and maybe that was a good thing. We still ordered, and ate, cause we were too tired to stop anywhere else and hoped the food still stood up to memory. The drink station looked like it hadn't been cleaned in....a long time. Food and randoms all crusted in the corners of the containers the plastic utensils and sauce packets were in - yeah, no thanks, we will use our utensils at home. And yeah - the food was gross. Didn't seem fresh at all and just soggy. Seems like Sam's (at least this one) has seen it's Golden Years and now is just in decline. Oh well.",0
This place used to be really awesome back in the day. Now it sucks. Maybe others are better but this location is no bueno.,0
The food isn't bad but the older Hispanic gentleman who works the cash register has poor customer service skills and could use a couple lessons on manners. Nobody wants to take food from a jackass.,0
"If you like dealing with people who have absolutely no personality, smack their gum, and with slower-than-necessary cadence say things like, \""""...well, unfortunately...\"""" then this is the store for you. I needed something at the \""""print center\"""" and they just couldn't be bothered. It was all about what they couldn't do. Believe me, I get that it's an office supply store, but come on, most of what they've got I can get someplace else and that exactly what I'll do.",0
"Found what I needed fast, store seems organized, but when I went to check out, the line has 5 people, and we have one person to check is out! I see 4 other workers just standing around and no incentive to help out! Will not return to this place, can just go to target or Walmart for anything they offer here.",0
"I have been ordering from here for awhile.. I dont really like it and there are better options for chinese fast food. But they are fast and cheap which is why i usually order from them. \nSome of the dishes are really good. While most of the dishes seem like a very cheap ripoff of what they should be.  All the sauces taste like they came right out of a container, and for some reason they bread everything! Even the sesame chicken.\n\nI will order from here again but i will stick with the lo mein.",0
"I moved into the area 1 year ago and have been going there for the year, the owner has a horrible energy about him, but  he has never been completely unpleasant to me, and I like his staff.

I could not understand what he was trying to say to me, and got super huffy and made me feel like an idiot.  I WILL NEVER STEP FOOT IN THERE AGAIN!!!!!!!!!  I don't care how clean the place is, a business owner should not treat any guest  like he treated me today.  Shame on him!  \nI support small business, this owner will NOT get mine.

This nail place is terrible. Theres one across the parking lot that at least doesnt change prices on you.,0
This place may be 'clean' however I ended up with nail fungus because of this place! Manicures may be okay but never get a pedicure unless you are prepared to take medication for three months to get rid if the fungus! Will never return,0

"We have been Jiffy Lube customers for 15 years.  They are quick, convenient and they do a great job.  Why mess with a good thing, right?  Recently, we had some difficulty with our Suburban.  We thought it was just electrical problems relating to our 4x4 switch.  When we took it to our mechanic they said there could be a possibility that our transfer casing was tampered with.  There are only two shops that touch our cars: Jiffy Lube and Gruelichs.  We called Jiffy Lube and spoke to the manager on duty, Gus.  He was very open to listen and actually came over to the mechanics to inspect the vehicle.  Gus notified his supervisor and sent us to the Jiffy Lube Customer Service representative, as per their policy.  We thought we were going to get the run around.  Mind you, it was during 4th of July holiday, so it did take some time.  We eventually were contacted by the rep who was going to send out the District Service Manager to OUR mechanic to inspect the problem with us!  They did not try to attempt to deny responsibility.  They, in our eyes, were taking as many steps as they could towards accountability.  Just to be sure that there was no bias, Gruelichs asked a third party to open the transfer casing and inspect it.  If it was tampered with we would know immediately.  This morning, we all stood around at State to State transmissions as they opened the casing.  What we found was that JIFFY LUBE WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE!  It showed normal wear and tear.  As hard as it was for us to swallow that we would have to pay for what is a common repair to older GM 4x4 vehicles, we were glad that the establishment that we had trusted for 15 years with our three vehicles was still reputable in our eyes.  They did everything right.  From the local manager, Gus, to Judy the Customer Service rep, to Darren the District Service Manager, they all listened to the customer.  They came to us, even with the possibility they may have to pay the bill.  They were kind and considerate.  I have to say thank you to Jiffy Lube for not dismissing us.  Thank you for years of good service to our vehicles and our family.  Thank you for putting the customer first.  Good job guys!",1
"3 oil changes here, every time is constant upsales. worse, they over-tighten the oil cap every time, causing the cap to break on the next change so they can charge for a replacement.",0

"I found Faust a year ago when I was looking for a vet close to my house. I had a really good vet that I went to but it was an hour drive away. I had a friend that took her dog to Faust and said they were great. So, I reluctantly gave them a try... \n\nAnd I am so glad I did! Both vets there are fantastic. Sympathetic, knowledgeable, and willing to provide lots of options for treatment. They have spent alot of time with me on the phone, answering many questions. They even call me monthly to see how my sickly cat is doing. And they are very patient. My cat is a PILL in the vet's office. He doesn't like anything being done to him. It took 3 of them to hold him down to take blood. But they are sweet and patient and have found ways to work with him. \n\nTammy and the other office staff are wonderful. After my cat threw himself and his carrier off the chair in the waiting room, the peed all over the floor, Tammy rushed to help me clean it up and minimized my embarrassment and concern. \n\nOzzy and I love Faust!",1
"My pets have been visiting Faust since Bonnie was there, well over 20 years.  The staff is incredible and I can't say enough about how awesome they are.  We also bring our dogs to Faust for not only the best in vet care, but for overnight boarding as well.   They go above and beyond.",1
My partner and I had an amazing experience today. We were here purchasing all parts to build a large gated garden. ARTIE was phenomenal! He walked us through the whole project from every little detail - he even cut our boards to size. Thanks Artie for making our experience so pleasurable!,1
"We found this place by chance, thank goodness. It is the best appliance store I've ever been in! Randy Rice has assisted us with several purchases. That guy knows EVERYTHING about the appliances they sell and never makes you feel like he's hard-selling. We've ended up with exactly what we hoped for each time we go in. The delivery and installation is always on time and trouble-free. No, they don't have the super cheap brands like big box stores, but they do have a moderate range of appliances (like GE) as well as luxury models (like Miele).  When you are looking for quality appliances and expert knowledge, definitely go here!",1
"This place was referred to me by my friend's neighbor. I was told the prices were good and the sales people were knowledgeable. What I wasn't told was this place operates like a used car lot. There is an \""""up\"""" system and you are basically treated like a piece of meat. The sales person was very pushy and made me feel like I was obligated to make the purchase there because of the time that I spent with them. The prices were average when compared to the other locally owned independent stores. I was basically almost strong armed into putting down a deposit. It takes me a lot to write negative reviews but I am hoping this review will help prevent this experience from happening  to someone else.",0
"This is a fun little place in Phoenix.  I went to visit my aunt and we were out and about looking at some furniture stores nearby and just kind of stumbled in to this place.  We ended up spending a long time having so much fun looking at all the crazy stuff in there.\n\nWhen you first walk in, there is a display of windchimes and I instantly fell in love with this peacock one (see photo).  I snatched it up right away and was trying to figure out the best way to hold it and still walk around without it breaking when the lady at the counter offered to keep it up at the counter while we browsed.  So nice.\n\nThey have all these hilarious tin and wood signs that my aunt, mom, and I stood in front of laughing like idiots for about 10 minutes.  They have interesting furniture, little knick knacks, and some pretty cool wall art.  After we had fun looking at all the stuff and I mentioned I would have to be careful with my peacock because I was flying back to Vegas, the lady at the front wrapped it up for me in so much bubble wrap that there was no way it would break in my suitcase.  And the best part?  They were having a sale, so it was 20% off on top of all the fun and great customer service.",1
"I have searched and searched for a dentist in the North Valley...and I was happy to find these guys a few years ago. They are very thorough, and they don't try to sell you things you don't need. I had a great dentist in Chandler, but after moving up to North Phoenix, it seemed that every dentist I went to want to do extra work and some didn't even want to clean my teeth. I am a 'teeth person' and take my dental work seriously. I wasn't thrilled when they told me I had a cavity last week, but then again they had been 'watching' these teeth for over year, so I know when he said I needed to get it filled, I really do need a filling. While cavities and fillings aren't my idea of a 'great way to start your day;' I don't mind it with these guys.",1
My family has been using this dental office for over 10 years now!  The staff really cares about their patients. I love this place. Not a fan of getting dental work done but I surely wouldn't do it anywhere else,1
"I am a bit partial to this bar... Our Band (Screaming Ant) plays there all the time. The bar it'self  has been around along time and shows it's age... But what's inside are the nicest folks I ever ran across in my life...  \n\nIt has pool, Large tv's for Sport games! Live Music!\n\nThe entertainment draws from some of the best rock  bands in the valley and brings some good ole rock and roll that you you just don't find anywhere else!\n\nNow,  besides the playing there I have no relations with anyone in the place, and all I know is that when I ask the owner if I could use the bar for an event to raise money for my sister, who has been diagnosed with cancer.

"Boring.\n\n1) just a cover band\n\n2) I don't mind having my ID checked but a second time as I'm putting it away from the first time? I realize that most of the crowd there was 40+ so they may not be used to the under thirties but really trust your staff, or coordinate better or something so I can finish a sentence and sit down without being interrupted a second time\n\n3) it's not too small but something about the layout made it feel really cramped\n\n4) CASH only or maybe there was a minimum. I remember it was an issue and don't expect them to warn you about it when you order your drinks. There is a sort of visible sign that you may or may not notice.\n\n5) Service could have been much more helpful and overall wasn't that friendly.\n\nWe won't be back. I just didn't really find any good points. Boring, loud, poor service bordering on rude, kind of a hassle just to get a drink unless you always carry cash.",0
"I think the people who work in this bar are some of the nicest you'll ever meet.  It's kinda divey but the drinks are very cheap and the band rocked (ReGroove).  There is a dance floor which is pretty generous, the band area is elevated and there are pool tables.  The bathroom is mediocre and the tables are all raised with stools which can get tough on the body if you're there for a while............but again, the staff is awesome, they have great bands and prices can't be beat!",1
"It's basically a hole in the wall that has live music.  The only problem with this joint is that you can't count on the bands or the guy at the joint that books them.  Without the band you're just stuck in a joint paying too much fit your food.  The regular customers are a good group of people and the staff has been there forever, so yeah, this could be your 'Cheers', but don't expect free refills or decent prices.  Everybody will know your name, though.",0
"Very very odd place. Will not be returning, extremely loud, forget having a conversation with anyone. We were by the front door and this stage on the other end of the bar, and still couldn't hear each other. \n\nDef a dive bar. Mostly men, keep a close eye on your wife or girlfriend. They'll be snatched if you're not careful. Lots of HOG members and other motorcycle clubs present. This crowd makes me somewhat nervous, and my husband is a 250lb biker.",0
"This was my neighborhood Big Lots.  I bought stuff for my apartment here.  I bought gifts here.  I spend way too much time here wandering up each and every aisle waiting for the perfect thing to jump out at me.  \n\nIf you've never been to a big lots, picture a Wal-Mart, squeezed down into a space not much larger than a Walgreen's.  Food, games, toys, crafts, kitchenware, cards, candles, frames, linens - all the departments are there - just much smaller.  And you could have a different grouping of stuff there every time you go - theoretically at least.  Some brands feel like they are always there, but it's hard to know which ones unless you've been going for quite a while.  \n\nTo me, Big Lots is like a sport.  The competition is how good a deal you can get.  If you're willing to take a sticky bottle, dented can, or sometimes just an old label - it can be amazing.",1
"I was really surprised at how much good stuff they had at Christmas. I was looking for gigantic bows and I found them there and more! The gal that stocks the place really takes pride to make sure everything is where it should be and knows it like the back of her hand. You ask, she knew exactly where it \""""would' be if they still had it. I will go back.",1
"Staff is cool, stuff is cheap, did I mention that the stuff is cheap? There really shouldn't be any reason to lower the stars for a Big Lots being a Big Lots. I hate a lot of things, this place isn't one of those things. If you're a regular, they'll definitely make you feel like one, even if you don't show for a couple months. Go in, say hello, but some stuff, repeat! It's a nice little local junk shop :)",1
Love this store - especially their clearance section.,1
I use to shop here all the time when i lived close by. Its a smaller book store but you can find books at some of the best prices in town. I often have payed just one dollar for books by great authors. If you love books and like them cheap this is a place to check out.,1
"Half Price Books is way over rated.  (1)  Has a lot of old, mangled paperbacks, mostly romance, (2)  Current and best sellers are meager, probably picked over by the staff, (3)  Bring in a current or best seller to sell and if you get a penny on the dollar, you're lucky.  You would be better served to donate your books to Good Will and taking the tax deduction.\n\n I used to go to this store a lot, but when they opened their Camelback location, it sure seems the way they financed it was to rip you off on the amount offered to buy your books and the quality of books in-store went way down hill.\n\nMy father-in-law had run in to the same problems, he being also a prolific reader, and he has quit going to Half Price Books.",0
"True story (and I hope someone from HBP sees this): I walk in the story today and ask the clerk for any books about celiac disease. She gives me a blank stare like it's a new band she hasn't heard of. \""""It's a dietary condition where you can't eat wheat or gluten, you know that gluten-free thing?\"""" It still doesn't register. No light bulb. I volunteer a suggestion: \""""The health section?\"""" She refers me to the cookbooks. Seriously. I'm not making this up. Considering the number of restaurants that now have gluten-free options, I would recommend - other than buying some of their staff a clue - having a \""""celiac\"""" book descriptor somewhere in the shelves. It's nearly impossible to find a book about celiac (and I'm pretty sure there *are* books about celiac) in HBP. Not the best place to go if you're looking for non-fiction books about celiac: lights on, but nobody home.",0
"Terriable. They broker the shipping of books on line. I ordered 4 books, they sent one directly and it was written in, yellow, smelly and disgusting. They refunded my dollar but not the four dollar shipping. I threw that book away. The other three books came from different shippers/resourses and all claimed to ship on the same date, I received one and then another 4 days later and the last I never received, when I contacted HPB they asked me to contact the shipper. DON'T BUY BOOKS HERE!!  There are much better sites to do this from.",0
"The book continues to live on! I love books. There's just something wonderful about holding a real book in your hand while you flip through the pages and enter a different world. Sadly, the tangible book seems to be over taken by the world of electronics, but luckily shops like Half Price Books keeps the book alive. \n\nThis shop is full of used books at reasonable prices, as well as DVDs, VHS (I kid you not) and other electronics and paper products. The best part is that they also buy your old books! Will you get a lot of money for them? No way. Sadly, you get about what feels like 1/10 of what you paid for it, but at least they buy them back at all! If you decide to sell your books, they will give you a coupon that's good for 10% off your purchase! This is a great shop to visit if you're looking for used books or if you need to sell some books.",1
"Located next to Target this book store has a nice selection of both used and heavily discounted new books as well as music, calendars and other fun stuff. This is not like going into one of the big chains where you can sit down drink coffee and read their product. Store is a little small. You may bump into someone if you are spacing out. Just say excuse me and continue enjoying yourself.\n\nI love to get my cookbooks here when I am experimenting with a new type of ethnic cuisine. They also have several selections by famous chefs and TV shows that you would see on some of the cable channels. Picked up a Triple \""""D\"""" cookbook on my last visit. Nice.\n\nToday I picked up several books out of the kids section for my new granddaughter. Had to get some Curious George in fact a bunch of them. They were only $1.99 each. These were my favorite as a child. Who doesn't like stories about a Monkey that gets into trouble and his pal The Man in the Yellow Hat.\n\nWhen you get tired of your old books you can trade them in or sell them for cash. Trade in is always a better value and then you can walk out with a fresh batch of reading material in the same visit.\n\nThey may not have exactly what you are looking for but it is always worth doing a quick pop in to see. You never know what you may score. Ding! Turn the page.",1
"NEVER sell anything to this place, they will rip you off. They will give you 1$ for a hardback book and sell the same one for 20$ the next day. Try Zia record exchange when selling dvds,  much more fair and honest.",0
Very helpful staff w/ selling and inventory. Will definitely come here again!,1
"Nice staff, great store with decent prices.  I like to get calendars here because it's a lot less $ than anywhere else.  We also like to root through the vinyl albums and have purchased many.  Make sure you check the condition, some are pretty trashed.",1
"First time visiting and upon entrance, I regretted not having the collection of CDs and DVDs to donate with me, but after receiving $13 Half Price offered for the 30 books* I brought in (that's 43 cents per book), I will not come back to sell anything else.  I was going to leave the books at work so that fellow readers could get enjoyment from them.  That thought gives me greater pleasure than the $13 in my hand.  (Changing Hands gave me $11 for four books just four days ago.)  Most of the books I brought had binds that weren't even broken- some were even brand-new!  I should've just taken them back.\n\n*Some of the brand-new titles I brought in: Culture Shock! (three editions- Britain, Philippines, Australia); Sara Gruen's Water For Elephants; Lahaye/Jenkins' Left Behind; Tim Lahaye's Revelations Unveiled; Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient; Alice Sebold's The Almost Moon; Lisa See's Dreams of Joy (hardback); and many more that were in very good condition.",0
"This is the best palce for nails and pedicures. I've been going here for 10 years and I love it. There shop use to be down the street from my house and then they moved up north and I followed them (which was a 45min drive) but well worth it. Young always does my nails and he always remembers exactly hows I like it so I don't have to tell him when I want them shorter. I am very picky about my nails and I've tried to other little shops by my house but they only end up lifting or breaking. Not to mention my acrylic fills last alot longer when I get them done here. Plus people always compliment me on my nails wherever I go, even when they are three weeks in. So even if you don't live in Paradise Valley it is worth the trip to get your nails and a pedicure done. Plus the prices are reasonable.\n\nI have to say I moved to California and I've already tried 5 different places and none of them compare to Splendid Nails. I miss you guys.",1
"I unfortunately did not enjoy my experience here. I was greeted by a few Asian men, one assisting 2 girls, and one watching tv. They told me to sit at the nail station and I would be helped shortly. A little Asian girl came out from the back and asked me very few questions before getting started. She went to put the nail on to start my acrylics, and she dropped a couple on the floor and attempted to put them on my nails. Then she didn't use enough glue, and the nails kept falling off before she was able to shorten all of them. There were a few other Asian employees there who were all talking in their native language, and completely ignored me. One of the men said sorry, that they were telling jokes. I was not happy with the cleanliness, professionalism, or their manner.",0
"I used to come here a long time ago when I lived in the area and since I recently moved back to this side of town I decided this was close and I'd start coming back here. Well, unfortunately I won't be coming back here ... Ever. And here's why...\n\nI came in today as a walk in and was asked \""""what I need\"""" and I said I wanted gel, then was told ok \""""one minute\"""" and so I went over to the seating area to wait, as I knew \""""one minute\"""" was not going to really be one minute and that just meant I had to wait, a strange way of Asian nails places to get you to stay and wait? When really I'm usually okay with waiting and expect it if I don't have an appointment. It's be nice if there was more accuracy in that regard, but oh well I'm used to it who cares right?\nWhatever so I'm sitting there waiting and 2 girls walk in and seem to have been familiar faces to the owner (so I assume) up front, the same guy who \""""greeted\"""" me (if that's what you want to call it) there was \""""hi how are yous\"""" exchanged and they were asked what they want they said \""""both wanted a full set\"""" then were told to wait over in my direction. They came sat right next to me and as he was finishing up with his customer and she was paying he yelled \""""would you like a pedicure too\"""" and I assumed he was talking to me because I was next right? But before I could say anything the girls answered yes. So he went back to his station and motion to come over and sit down, again I'm thinking this is me because I had been waiting and therefore I was next (or should have been) the two girls said quickly \""""both of us?\"""" And he shook his head as they got up to walk over there and sat down. At this point I was like really? That's not cool. It's one thing that I was skipped but another thing that I was not even acknowledge nor did he say \""""I'll be right with you\"""" or something of the sort. Kind of rude, but I continued to sit and wait for him or someone to motion me on over but as I looked around and realized that was not happening any time soon, I just got up to walk out. As I was walking out he nearly screamed at me \""""WAIT JUST ONE MINUTE\"""" again and I politely said \""""no thank you\"""" and continued out the door. \n\nObviously he took precedence over the two girls, one because they were familiar customers, and two because they were spending more money than me. \nI came in gym clothes with no make up on and looking kind of haphazard from working out... Had I been all dolled up I have a feeling I would've been treated differently, based on how I was treated alone. \nIt's too bad because I am a loyal customer who is in the service industry myself, therefore tip very well. \n\nWORD OF ADVICE: you should really think about they way you do business, especially when there a 15 other nail salons within a half a mile to a mile radius. \nThanks. But like I said, NO THANKS.",0
I used to go there all the time because it is right around the corner from my house. They are all so rude and the pedicures are short and very expensive compared to others. Last time I went was 6 months ago and spent $65 and wasn't happy with anything! Swore Id never go back. They don't listen and over charge! \nWell today they were the only place open so I thought everyone deserves a second chance so I went back. Again pedicure was horrible and expensive. The young guy is always so rude. I asked him to file down my nails. They are so crooked it's not even funny! Waist of my time and another $60! Never again! \nUnless you've been going here forever they will treat you bad and overcharge you! Find another salon fast!!,0
"Not sure I would even give this place a 1 star. I visited the one in paradise valley mall. The girl wouldn't talk to you other then tell you to move your feet. It's the worse pedicure I have ever had!!! She cut my cuticle, grated of to much skin causing it to bleed on both feet. The bottom of my feet are raw and it looks like my 7 year old niece painted them. When I called back to let the owner know they had cut and made me bleed all I got was oh sorry. I will never be going back here! Horrible pedicure!",0
I've been having my nails and pedicures done here for only a couple of months.  So far they have provided great service with good prices.,1
"I just made my last trip to this Brand.  After 4 months of having my nails done every two weeks and a pedicure about every 6 weeks, I will no longer patronize this brand at either of their locations.  \n\nThe reason?  This afternoon I went in for my fill and after things were started I noticed the nail clippings from the previous customer on the towel covering the work station.  I was grossed out.  Then I felt goo on my forearm near my elbow from a previous customer.  Needless to say I am way more than unhappy with today's experience.  Whats worse, is that the customer after me, was put through the same thing as I did not see the towel changed, cleaned or anything.  This is disgusting and I won't be back.",0
"These \""""residential suites\"""" are nothing more than a run down, dated and dirty cheap hotel. Typical low class residents, guests and especially \""""management\"""". What a joke! They will try to get $$ from you anyway they can. My son was going to rent a studio here, but after we experienced the \""""management\"""" first hand we decided not to proceed. Kept his money anyway. BEWARE! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED NOW TWICE by your fellow Yelpers! Stay clear of this dump and their minimum wage staff.",0
"Are you a blonde, or considering going blonde?  After years of frustration I finally found a hairdresser who is a genius with color! Her name is Lisa Fournier and she has been with Grandstrands for many years. I have been using her for almost 10 years.  Make sure that you plan ahead when making your appointments, as she is usually heavily booked! You will LOVE your color, and for those who have long hair, she isn't scissor happy like many hairdressers I have come across. I moved since starting to use her and now have a 35-40min. drive to get there, but it's worth it!",1
My children can be very shy but Craig knew exactly how to make them feel comfortable and they actually enjoyed their haircuts!  For a great cut and supreme customer service I definitely recommend Craig as a stylist.  He has been my hair consultant for many years!,1
"This is actually the worst American Eagle I have been to. The standards were fine, but only because it seems that's all they pay attention to. We felt like the associates were allergic to customers. We didn't want to mess up their denim behind the cash wrap but they didn't want to help, despite hearing us struggle and look over from 4 feet away but just kept talking to each other at the counter. I actually had to move out of one of the girls way as she squeezed by me and i was the one who had to say excuse me. Maybe she was mute, im not sure. As we walked to the fitting rooms, 2 of them walked out passed us and back to the registers to chat. We stood there waiting and finally had to walk up and ask for someone to open a door. We both made a purchase, as the whole store was 40% off but I feel like just returning it all.",0
"My brother swears by the AE jeans - its what he wears.  They don't work for me.  I will admit I have some nice button down shirts given to me as gifts over the years - that's what I went into look for today.  I went through several shirts and sizes up front, wondered the store a bit, looked at some jeans and other shirts as well.   There were 2 associates on the floor.  Neither acknowledged me in any way shape or form while I was there.  On a visit after this initial review - same exact scenario but I was the only one there on a weekend evening - I was acknowledged by an associate whom I stood in front of and she informed me of their sale going on.  I have shopped there a couple times previously and don't recall a negative experience with service - they just must not be trained to be proactive.",0
"Pure Fitness as a whole I like. No contracts, the people going there are actually there to work out and not to be seen, (ex. LA Fitness). Plus you get complimentary training sessions. However, this location I will NEVER return to and its all because of their new GM Adam. I had a free pass and he was the one that I had been assigned to for my fitness test and 1st training session. I had already explained that I planned to join but he wouldn't stop the full court press of selling which I didnt like at all. I wanted to use my weeks free pass THEN join. He wanted me to give him money right then and there when he hadnt so much as given me a tour yet! Anyway, I told him I wanted to wait and then he starts asking when I get paid, is it a money situation, etc..if made me VERY uncomfortable.\n\n I went ahead with the training session and he knew in advance that Im not inactive but going to the gym is not something Ive done on a consistent basis in a very long time. Now I enjoyed the workout but from what others have told me..he pushed me way to hard for my first time out of the gate. My arms weren't sore, I know sore, Im okay with sore but they became weak for FIVE days, that I had trouble sleeping they had that irritable and restless feeling, and it hurt to use a freakin' date stamp at work! \n\nBut the reason Im not going back..I was surfing them online and saw how easy it was to sign up online so I did. That way I wouldnt have to worry about remembering voided checks etc.  Well I called Adam to let him know and he went off on me.. just short of yelling. \""""Great, now I lose the commission the gym loses the points.. you can understand why Im upset right.\"""" and he went on for about 5 minutes. I was stunned at how unprofessional he was and he's the GM??? If they work on commission they should give you a heads up \""""hey I know its easy to sign up online but we work on commission so I would appreciate it if you went through me if and when you choose to sign up\"""". I would have respected that. OR if when you sign up online it allows you to put in the name of the person you have been working with so it doesn't circumvent them. But I was floored and pissed that he came at me like that. \n\nPs. Of all the Pure Fitness this one is the smallest, visually unappealing and has the worst customer service. I did sign up and I love the one I go to now...but this one I will never step foot in again",0
"Pretty decent so far. \nI think the monthly trainings are great and Andrea has really helped me. I think I've lost about 7 lbs in the last week and a half. Usually they will try to upsell me on training which I thought at first was a little annoying, but I just advise them that I cannot and leave it at that. It doesn't bother me anymore. After using a machine we are to wipe it down for the next person. The problem with that is half the time the paper towel dispensers are empty...\n \nOne thing I suggest to them is to rent/buy the vacant suite next to it. The gym is growing and it probably would be a good thing to do. :)\n \nOverall I enjoy the gym and think the equipment is suitable.",1
I want to give a shout out to Sam who works filling up balloons. She is an amazing and dedicated employee. I came in on Monday to get three balloons made for a photo shoot and she went above and beyond to help me create the look I was trying to achieve. Sam seriously spent a solid 30 minutes with me and was so kind. \nI greatly appreciated this excellent customer service.,1
"There are lots of children's resale shops in the Valley to choose from, and I've been to most, but the first time I visited Other Mothers will be the last time.  My first impression walking in the doors is that Goodwill has better looking stuff and in better shape.  The stroller selection is decent, but a little overpriced for what you get. The clothing section of the store is a mess of tall racks that you can't even see over and is not very enticing at all. \n\nMy main gripe is that I brought in several items that were in great condition (a contrast to their selections) and I received an insulting meager amount for said items.  Secondly, they are very slow at evaluating and pricing the items that I was immediately handed a pick up slip and told that I would have to come back at 4PM for my cash (It was 11AM).  For an almost new, great condition baby swing, for example, don't expect to get more than 15 bucks for it.  Moments later after bringing in the rest of my items, I was then told that I would have to wait two hours more to come back and pick up my cash or credit.  The reason?  Because other people were bringing in stuff too.  So, if you believe in first come, first served, understand that Other Mothers doesn't believe in this simple courteous policy.",0
"I can't believe there aren't 100 other reviews on here! This place was THE WORST! I will not return here nor will I reccomend it! I walked it with 2 bags full. I went to the back where there were 2 employees finishing up with another lady. I should've taken it as a hint when the lady said \"""" No I'll just take my stuff and sell it on Craigslist. I can get more out of it that way!\"""" I stayed to wait it out. Big mistake! The lady left with her stuff. The 2 employees didn't even acknowledge me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Instead they proceeded to talk crap about the lady that just left! Their exact words \""""What makes them think we even care? Take it or leave it. I don't care\"""" Hello! I was standing there! They still didn't speak to me as I got up and left! Other mothers! You suck! Hire people who CARE....who WANT to work!!!!!!!! I went to Kid To Kid on Tatum & Thunderbird.....SO MUCH BETTER!",0
"I hate this store and the ONE on bell !!!!!!  They rip you off , when you trade in .... always messy , always all over the place NEVER AGAIN !!!",0
"I agree, I had a similar situation when I went to the one off of Bell and I-17. The place is a mess, the staff was rude and when I brought in stuff for consignment, they told me i could come back the NEXT DAY for my credit. When I did return they had taken one item (out of 3 big bags of hardly used or brand new baby clothes). \nI have bought several things from this particular store, but if you are looking for shoes, they are filthy and smell horrible, the toys have missing parts and are grungy, yet they still take them.\nI did go ONCE to the store off of greenway and also witnessed the women in the back (consignment area) trash talking a customer that they had an earlier conversation with. I love consignment shops for kids clothes, as a mom you learn how to make a buck stretch. but I suggest going to once upon a child off litchfield, or going to hissyfits. I would not suggest Other Mothers.",0
"Visited the store on 32nd Street in Phoenix today...The only good thing I have to say is that the prices are super cheap. If you can handle a really dirty store, with a really dirty floor, you can find some great deals.\n\nPersonally, I'd rather pay a little more and get a clean shopping experience. Also, we had to look through a lot of WalMart clothing as well to find any upscale bargains.",0
"Open on weekends, incl. Sundays! Yay! \nKnowledgeable guitar teachers! Yay!\nMore reasonable lesson fees! Yay!\nAcross the street from the movie theater! Yay!\nConvenient location w/ plenty of parking! Yay!\n\nSkip the other place a couple blocks away and go here.",1
"It's hard to get a music store right and also make money at it. I've worked in music stores, taught in music stores and am a music teacher. AZ Music does it right. There aren't many like this around any more. \n\n*The employees are friendly and quick to educate you about anything you may wish to know. \n\n*The repair facility is top notch. Don't be scared away by the $50 bench fee for pro audio repairs. I had my Mackie amplifier repaired here. Rex is the master and it was a pleasure to shake his hand.\n\n*They offer lessons which are the bread and butter of most music stores these days and I've heard great things from students and parents about their staff in that respect.\n\n*They are fair priced and do special orders.\n\nLong story short, GO TO AZ MUSIC!",1
"TERRRRIBLE!!!!! RUDE SERVICE!\nFirst of all when i was checking out the guy asks me if I'm a illegal immigrant. (yet i speak perfect english) then he starts this whole rant about illegal immigrants stealing jobs and robbing America's economy. \nSecond a complete rip off on repairs. They don't give you an estimate for the job before hand either, the repair was supposed to be done in a week it took then 2 and a half weeks. \nWILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN!!",0
"Horrible!! In September 2013, we took my daughter's Yamaha trumpet in for a minor repair. In January, they still had not repaired it. In February, when we returned again not only had it NOT been repaired, they had somehow caved in one of the valves. They did not charge us, but in no way did they offer to try to make it better or even apologize for the additional damage they did. A completely shameful way to do business. Customer beware.",0
I came into this Sally's at 8:30pm (30 minutes before they close) because of a coloring Catastrophe. The two girls working rolled their Eyes when they saw a customer had entered the store. They Were already counting the drawer as if it were 5 min. Till close. I had questions And was Ignored even though there was no one else in the store. My roots were the same color as Ronald McDonald's for pete's sake!! Ladies help me out here!!!?? I love Sally's but this location really let me down.,0
The price is right!  The staff is attentive and caring.  Tina does an excellent job on our dogs and also has helpful tips with our dogs.  \n\nMickey has been going here for several years and goes in looking like a pound puppy leaving looking like a show dog!  Minnie our newest addition has gone in a few times and each time she looks fantastic!  They even put a feather in her hair and she's gotten alot of compliments!\n\nDogs should'n't be caged and the cubbies that they have--I feel make our dogs feel more comfortable when they are a little shaky from being left in a somewhat foreign environment.  \n\nA++++,1
"Tina, from Critter Corral Pet Grooming on North 32nd Street in Phoenix, groomed my scaredy cat Max.  This is a quiet shop (no barking or whining when I was there with beautifully groomed dogs that were so happy and darling), and the lovely groomers who work their own tails off.  Very professional.  Tina groomed Max so cute that he knew it and was strutting his stuff when we got home!  Excellent shop!",1
"I am so happy to be able to take my big guy here to be groomed. He is 150 pounds of hot mess.(He is a Newfoundland) When I bring him in its because I haven't done what I should be doing on a daily basis like  brushing and he's all tangled up and he comes back looking amazing! Laurel is great with him and really makes sure to not stress him out and always goes above and beyond my expectations. I also like the fact that they don't throw him in a cage, the dogs get to be out in their stations and everyone is very friendly there. Money well spent. I am going to be moving soon out of the area and I still will be making a trip as needed to take him to her, I have a great trust in her work. Thanks!",1
Horrible placed an order said they couldn't find the address then said they were at the address knocking and ringing the doorbell none of which was true.  When talked on the phone they said they knew where it was they deliver on the street all the time not a difficult address or a hard one to find,0
These pizzas used to be really good.  Great sauce and a nice thin crust.  Now the sauce has no taste and the crust is thick and doughy.  Can't tell the difference between the box and the pizza.  Pass on this one Wal Mart has a better pizza in the frozen aisle.,0
"We have had the pizza before and didn't eat most of it which is why I called and asked about a special for the wings, which are awesome! The female employee had major attitude issues (AKA bitchyness)  and the Manager lost his patience after the first few sentences. The conversation went...\n\nSardella's  special, Large cheese 16 inch pizza and 40 wings for 29.99. The wings alone are 28.00 even.\n\n I call and ask for the special but instead of a large I want a medium, I don't want to waste it because we cant eat a large and the pizza is just meh.\n\nThey tell me they cant do it.... I ask why not and state that they would have to use less ingredients and less effort to make a smaller pizza for the same price therefore making more money on their end.... \n\nThey say well we cant change the special... I say but I'm not asking for something ridiculous... I just WANT LESS PIZZA FOR THE SAME PRICE. Again they say they  cant change the special. I ask them to make a small exception by shrinking the size of pizza they would have to make. They reply with \""""well if I make exceptions for you I would have to make exceptions for other people but I can give you a medium for 5 dollars more...\"""" I decline and state I will be paying more to make a smaller pizza which is counterproductive to having a special. They get irritated and I fear they will spit in my food... \n\nI gave up... GOTTA LOVE EDUMICATED PEOPLE!!!   Or is there something I am not understanding in the pizza industry ???",0
"We ordered 3 pizzas and one of them was so undercooked that it was inedible.  The mushrooms were canned and there was no flavor. The manager first hung up on me when I called and when I called back he had a major attitude problem and took no responsibility for the lack of quality control from his employees.  This place was a waste of money, do not waste your time, appetite, or money here. We will never order from here again.",0
My husband and I stopped in 30 minutes before close  one evening. We ordered a large veggie pie with 1/2 side add sausage. The motz was minimal and mediocre. The sausage tasted like pre-packaged crumbles. The mushrooms were artificial and straight out of a slimy can. The crust was under cooked and forgettable. The only ingredient that was worth a darn was the sauce.  I've baked far superior pies in my own oven and they came from a freezer.,0
"Got the works pizza on a Monday to try the place out for half price.  We really wanted to like it, but the pizza is truly lacking, toppings were not even or abundant.  It would be hard to pay $19(full price) for a pie that weak.  Needless to say we'll try the place again.",0
"Ordered pizza and wings from the store at 32nd Street and Greenway.\nPositives: Order was delivered quickly and driver was awesome. Food was hot. Wings were outstanding.\n\nNegatives: Pizza was NOT what was ordered!\nI ordered a medium pepperoni with EXTRA SAUCE and EXTRA CHEESE.\nWhat I got was a medium pepperoni with NO SAUCE and REGULAR CHEESE!\nWhy did I get charged for extra when I didn't get it, and NO SAUCE! \nI MEAN NONE AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nVery disappointed in the pizza.",0
"I heard they sell the Westin Heavenly Bed (well, the version of it) and they do and we bought it Sunday at 5:30pm, they said they could deliver it that night!  HOLY COW!  That's awesome.  Even though we had it delivered the next day, we were very impressed with the same day delivery option.\n\nMichael Christie was our guy, he was knowledgable and professional.  Not a salesy type of guy and we liked that about him.  \n\nThere were many options to choose from in all price ranges.  As we were matress shopping, we found it a bit odd to be laying around on different mattresses in public and discussing what we liked and didn't like about each one-- but in Mattress Firm, it wasn't as odd feeling as some of the other stores we hit up that day.\n\nBuying a new mattress feels like the best thing we have done in a long time.... the one we picked out is AWESOME so far.  The price is pretty hard to beat BUT if we see that exact same mattress for a cheaper price at their store or any other store, they will refund the difference PLUS 10%.  \n\nThe delivery guys set it up in less than 15 minutes and gave us the 5-8pm time slot and arrived just a bit after 5pm-- loved that.  I hate sitting around and waiting and waiting.\n\nIf all goes well, we won't need to buy a new one in at least 15 years so let's hope I don't review another mattress store until then.\n\nBTW, the Heavenly Bed knock off is a Simmons Beautyrest Classic.  They say it is the same bed but without the Westin tags on it.  We got the upgraded one for a bit more firmness and the pillowtop.  I want to lay on it all day.  \n\nSweet Dreams.",1
"Unbelievable!  Within 2 weeks I have had 2 great experiences with the store manager and the interim store manager. I bought the wrong bed and box springs for my 88 year old mother. I went back today and the interim manager, Jacob Tinsley, was superb. Jacob demonstrated the utmost professionalism in supporting my problem, his competence in communicating and understanding his inventory, and took every precaution possible to ensure all of our transactions were complete and accurate. With Jacob's support, I bought another set for my mother and kept the great buy I relieved last week. I would recommend Mattress Firm to anyone, and especially Jacob. \n\nJust when you thought it couldn't get any better, because I had asked for Clyde, the store manager that was in vacation, Jacob credited the sale to him. Every company should have a Jacob on their sales team. Thank you!",1

"With having a car comes a lot of annoying responsibility. Tires are definitely an annoying responsibility. \n\nDiscount tries to make things as easy and painless for you as possible, which I appreciate. Sure I LIKE my car, but I'm not one of those people who is obsessed with it. Because I know practically nothing about cars, I appreciate how you can bring your car to Discount and have them check your tires without an appointment to make sure everything is OK. Also when I have had to bring it in they have always been very fast and the guys working there do great customer service. Although they work as fast as they can, I would have someone come with you in a separate car so you can escape for an hour out of the oil smelling lobby with no recent magazines.",1
"NEVER go here.  This place will rip you off eventually.  I sent a friend here who knows little about cars - she told me the customer service reps were making prank calls to other stores as she was waiting for service.  THEN they installed the wrong size tire on her car - four of them, in fact, which could have damaged her struts.  WHY?!?!?  \n\nAfter her experience here, I realized that they had failed to follow basic instructions of mine when I had bought several new tires, with the end result that I drove around for six months with no spare tire (partially my fault, of course, I should've checked that the tire floating around my trunk held air - I might've noticed the large gaping hole in the tire at some point).  I hereby resolve never to return to Discount Tire.  Apparently, they're managed by Neanderthals.",0
"I almost wasted $260 on an unneeded tire. I brought in my car to fix a flat, it had a nail in it. After waiting almost an hour they told me it was unrepairable and tried to get me to buy a new tire. They were originally purchased at Fletcher's so I brought it there instead, hoping it was under warrantee. To my surprise they fixed the flat with no problem and I was on my way in 30 minutes, didn't have to spend a penny. Sham on you discount for trying to take advantage of a lady.",0
These guys rule!!! Per chance I got there about half an hour after they'd closed and some guys were still locking up. They STILL took me in and fixed my flat at no cost! You just don't see that kind of friendly service anywhere!,1
"Great service.  They won't try to sell you anything that you don't need.  If you prefer to have a different types of tires that goes to your vehicle, they will tell you why and why not it works or don't work on the car.  They want what's best for your vehicle.  They don't work on commissions, so feel free to ask as many questions as you possibly have.  I recently bought 4 tires for 2 of my vehicles for the President's Day special.  It's good deal when you know what you are doing.  Give them a try if you haven't done it before.  I know I'll go back again for more of their great services.",1
"The best chiro I have ever been too.  He has really helped me with lower back pain, with out all the violent cracking.  Seriously, give Dr. Keith a try you will love it.",1
OMG I had chronic back pain for years--he is totally awesome.  Im so happy to finally be pain free!!!,1
"Creations in Cuisine catered my wedding in September.  We had a burger bar set up. The burgers were under cooked, there were no vegan options as we requested, and they ran out of food for our guest. Simply put, we were not satisfied.",0
"We used Creations In Cuisine Catering for a Christmas/Holiday party for our work.  They were spectacular.  The food was amazing, the setup, the employees, everything was immaculate.  I didn't hear one bad thing about them from anyone at the party.  Actually, most of our employees wanted their name so they could use or refer them in the future.  \n\nThe quality of food was unsurpassed.  The appetizers and dinner were out of this world.  \n\nThe staff and chefs were amazing.  They were so nice, helpful and attentive.  \n\nI would highly recommend if you are looking for a caterer in the Phoenix area that you give them a call.  We were not disappointed and will definitely be calling them again in the future.",1
"APD is not only the best paintball shop in Arizona but one of the best anywhere in the southwest/west coast. Matt and Jon are the best guys around, super friendly, incredibly knowledgeable and the prices are always fair. The fact that they have been here for nearly 12 years says it all - no matter where you are in the valley this place is worth traveling for.",1
"I find Harmony House Music a great place to shop for almost all my music needs. The review before me I find to be a nervous shopper. The staff watches you to make sure they meet ALL your needs. I found the staff very friendly and helpful. I bought a New Fender Ultimate Chorus Amp, So for him to say what he did about their line is just not true. Yes they do allot of catering to students, it's called Bread and Butter, and I fully understand that. No they can't compete with the large chain stores with allot of the famous brands, But they do carry some. They  will go out of their way to make sure you are a satisfied customer. As for the antique side of the store, I have found many little trinkets of my likening. If you don't go look you wont know it's there. Over all I find Harmony House Music a great place to shop.",1
"The original review for Harmony House is outdated and inaccurate.  I found this place to be an absolutely excellent music store. These guys are helpful, friendly, offer honest advice (regardless of their cut in the deal).  \n\nThey keep a nice stock at reasonable prices and are authorized Fender and Gretsch dealers. They also have a nice stock of pianos, though I don't know too much about that.  No, I am not affiliated with them in any way, except for being a satisfied customer. I absolutely recommend.",1
"The sales staff must be paid on commission here because they will not leave you alone...EVER! I think if I told them I was contagious they would still fight over who got to \""""help\"""" me shop. I am an independent shopper..if I want help than I will ask, but usually I just want to shop on my own. To over-priced and annoying for me to come in again.",0
"I had the most horrible shopping experience here today.  I went to go get a new pair of jeans and when I walked in the sales associate came up to me and asked if he could help.  He then proceeded to argue with me about what size I am.  He finally let me try on a size that is one size smaller than I wear.  I tried them on while the whole time he stood outside of the dressing room telling me about how everyone calls him \""""the jean guy\"""" and that i should tell all my friends to come get their jeans from him.  After I tried on the jeans that were so tight I could barely breath he then told me that I could NOT try on a size larger. I was so livid I threw the jeans down and walked out. I will never go back and I will not be telling my friends about \""""the jean guy.\""""",0
Buckle is 'the' place to shop when you are looking for a pair of jeans.  What I value about Buckle is their customer service.  They know their products and I go into a dressing room and they are always right there offering up different styles and sizes until I find a pair that best suited to me. \n\nMy daughter shops there as well and when a pair of jeans she bought there became prematurly worn (9 months after purchase) she brought them back to the store to see if they would stand behind their product and they did!  She came home with a new pair.  \n\nI endorse Buckle!,1
"very poor customer service, i am only going to arrowhead Buckle from now on!! completely ignored at pv and there selection was poor.",0
"Terrible experience...not like the stores.  The corporate heads have lost touch with the customers.  Never experience corporate till now....I sent back items which were not what I ordered and received a note saying that they have been retagged....did not know what this was until they explained it to me.  As I have bought thousands of dollars from them and referred many friends who have done the same....I was stunned.  As I got shifted around to corporate management who have lost touch with the customer experience...it became apparent that they did not want to help but make excuses for their mistake and put blame on me.\n\nWhat I did find from the managers who are friends at the stores that I did shop at was that this is happening more lately and she heard that they need to move slow inventory to reduce inventory....hence tagging items incorrectly and then sending them out.  When you try to return them they blantantly blame you for shady practices and if you make waves they ask you not to shop at their store.  This way they can get rid of you without having to replace anything....hence move inventory that they can't sell and financial books look good.\n\nI am appalled at this experience with On Line and Corporate....if you want to move slow inventory put it on sale or donate it.....don't make me pay for something I don't want.  Be wary of ordering on line!!!!!!  Also make sure you check the quality of what you buy....with jeans check the alignment of the back pockets since most are crooked and shirts check the seams also since mis-aligned.....you are paying a higher price so expect higher quality and top notched customer service.  Also I would recommend Nordstroms, they have the same price products sometimes cheaper, with better quality and exceptional customer service and return policy...they stand by what they sell.",0
Best sandwich in town!,1
"This deli may seem out of place as it is set in a corner lot dominated by a Food City and other Hispanic oriented businesses.  Those who went to the old Chompie's in the same shopping center might even have missed it.\n\nHave been getting lunch here for quite a few years now.  It is a real Old World family run deli.  The meats in here are wonderful.  I think a Polish family owns the place.\n\nThe have a list of sandwiches that are all HUGE, super tasty and very affordable ( with tax around $7). Skip those chain subway shops and get a real sandwich here!\n\nAs mentioned by Daren, this place might take cash only.  I think they do take debit cards, but you have to order a certain $ min....be safe and take cash.  This place gets busy at lunchtime and there are about 3 tables in here.  Better to take you grub to a less crowded spot to savor it in peace...\n\nWarning: You will go for lunch and want to buy about 10 lbs. of deli meat!",1
"Every review I have read is right on!  I had no idea what I was getting into when I stepped foot into this little family owned deli.  Old school - quality meats, great sandwiches.  The sandwiches feed two people for $8.  All I have to say is if you don't try it you are just straight foolish!!",1
Wow! Best Sandwich this the valley - Try the #12 you will not regreat- they even ship this sandwiches to NYC,1
"This is the best deli ever! How could it not be with the hours of operation? This is a serious family operation. \n\n If preserved and smoked meat products are your thing then his place is your local Mecca. The meat case is glorious. Bring their home made weiners to any party and you will be the hit of the party. The Hungarian Salami is melt in your mouth good. \n\nBring some extra spending money and stock up on some of their pantry items which are very unique and very tasty. They sell a product called Ajvar (sp?) that is a spicy pepper compote, it make everything delicious, sandwiches, pasta sauces, just add it to sour cream and use it as a dip, bomb!\n\nI have yet to have one of their sandwiches as I try to avoid bread but every time I am there and someone else orders one, my mouth starts watering as the lady behind the counter slices piles of meat for their sandwiches, those mothers are huge!",1
You can not get a better sandwich in the valley than the #12. It is the best anywhere plus everything else there is terrific. Best meats you ever wanted.,1
"Fantastic place to buy really good quality home made produce and at such a reasonable price. A tiny little place, but really is worth the visit. The lady running it is an absolute diamond, I tried so many nice cured meats. I asked for some English styled back bacon, it was a no :-( but then she brought out a tray of freshly cooked belly pork for me. I hadn't got home before it was all polished off - beautiful. The Polish sausages were a real hit and really large. They made an already good toad in the hole top draw.\n\nLooking forward to another visit!",1
Been here once. Got the Italian special & the European sub. Both were really good! I tried both & couldn't decode which one I liked better lol. The sandwiches are actually 2 sandwiches when you order the full sandwich so you get huge portions! Not bad at all for $7 & change. Lots of other European goodies that I had never seen. Sweets too. I tried the kinder country chocolate bar. The girl at the counter said it was Germany's most popular candy. I can tell why! Yummy!!!,1
"They have teaworst, so they're awesome. Buy teaworst.",1
"This place is AMAZING!!!!! It is the BEST Euro deli around! \n\nWhen you walk in, you are greeted with an aroma of their homemade meats. The market is quaint with some very unusual yet delicious grocery items. But the best part about this place....their kielbasa sandwiches. Oh, and their amazing owner who is always so nice and helpful.\n\nWe love \""""eating in\"""" at one of the two small tables and just enjoying wonderful food and feeling very much at home.",1
Authentic and fresh. It's always great to see your meat sliced in front of you. Hot pastrami on rye took me right back to my childhood in Manhattan.,1
"So....You say you want authentico?? My family secret shhhh! This place is owned by a lady named Maria. We have dubbed this place just \""""Maria's\"""" we have been going here for year's!! When the white folk's around me say let's go to Valley Luna I have to school them on what's real food. This food is pure Jalisco and it is what it is! If you want some good home style cookin' in this part of town I would stop in for a bite! You better believe that this place gets busy for dinner so plan accordingly or don't go at peak times for those who don't like crowds. This is a nice little place w a bar and tv's. My sibling's would live here if they could my sister swears by the green chili burro, not for the weak as it brings the heat. I don't eat meat so I get the norm cheese enchiladas, chile relleno, etc all super in my book. I will take pics soon in the meantime here is a recent write up about the place http://www.azcentral.com/ent/dining/articles/2008/03/20/20080320elconquistador.html\n\nP.S. Closed Monday's",1
"The service was fine, and the atmosphere, while nothing special.\nThe food was not that great, it was not as i was expected from the reviews here i read on yelp.\nsorry, i must had gone in at the wrong time. nothing more to say and very disappointed..will try again next month when i am in that area.",0
"Yes, sometimes the service can be slow. If you are in a hurry, I'm sure that there is a taco shop somewhere close to you. If you are looking for THE BEST Mexican Food restaurant in Phoenix, El Conquistador is it. I cannot recommend this place enough to everyone I know. The old location used to be close to my house, but we still drive 15 miles out of our way to come here every week. The food is consistently outstanding. My favorite is the enchiladas verdes con pollo. Delicious!!!  The new location is at 5350 West Bell Road, Suite 123-124, Glendale, AZ 85308.",1
"Food here is decent, but not worth the surly service.\n\nThe owner's husband didn't even have the consideration to get off the phone the entire time we were there. It was plastered to his ear even while he was waiting on us. It was obvious both of them hated having to work there.\n\nWe asked the owner, who was sweet as pie last time we visited at the old location, how she liked the new digs. She kind of shrugged, mumbled something about the \""""economy\"""" and quickly ignored us to go fawn over some other table. Hmm, oddly I know of several independent restaurants that are thriving, with lines out the door, despite the \""""economy.\"""" Maaaayyybeee, and this is just a wild guess, it could be the fact that people don't want to spend their hard-earned money for so-so food and shoddy service. Just an idea.\n\nOh, and all of those signs that are posted everywhere with stern warnings about not using a credit card unless you charge $15? Totally against the contract you signed with Visa, Mastercard, et. al. You either take credit or you don't. If I want to charge 5 cents, it would be a real jerky thing to do, but technically I could. Take the signs down. They're obnoxious, for one, and against the rules for another.",0
"What a lot of people don't understand about El Conquistador is that it is on par with the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld. You do not go there for ultra-friendly and speedy service, you simply be happy that you are seated at a table about to eat some of the best mexican food in the world...maybe second to Los Dos Molinos, but hey that's all the way down by South Mountain. Mark and Maria are wonderful people churning out some incredible food. My all time favorite is the El Conquistador burrito enchilada style. It's filled with steak picado, chile relleno and beans and smothered in yummy green sauce.",1
"I was desperately in need of mexican food one day at lunch or else I was going to rip someone's face off... it was just one of those days and luckily I drove by this place.\n\nDefinitely 5 stars for Maria, who I gather owns this place, as she was really nice and inviting. I needed to get my food to go, which wasn't a problem and I ordered a carne asade burrito which came with a side of beans and rice - oh I also got a bag of chips and salsa too! That was a plus, especially since I wasn't expecting it.\n\nWhen I finally got to sit down and eat my food it totally appeased the burrito beast inside me. There was a lot of food and the rice was delicious too. I think I spent around ten bucks...not too bad. Also, just a note - they only accept cards with a $15 minimum so if you plan to spend less than that, bring cash!",1
"I may not be the world's most careful person with phones, but this time, my phone breaking was NOT my fault!  Since my phone is under a year warranty (suck it iPhone!) we were told that we could take it to a Sprint Repair Center and get it replaced.  We took it to one, and the guy tried to blame the broken phone on me, when it was clearly a manufacturing defect.  He then directed us to this store and said they might be able to help us.  \n\nWe came in and were immediately greeted by someone and sat down so we could get the phone issue resolved.  Pretty awesome so far.  The guy looked over the phone a bit, did some stuff in the computer and then handed me a receipt saying I could get my replacement phone in just a couple days!  He even activated my old phone so I wouldn't be communication-less.  Sweet!  \n\nI was really impressed with this Sprint store.  The employees are all very helpful, they're incredibly knowledgeable and they have a fun sense of humor.  Plus, the crazy lady next to us was entertainment.  I was very VERY happy with my experience here.",1
"Walking in to this sprint store is a drag, no one greets you and if you do get lucky enough to get the help of one of the employees, in my experience, they act like its such a chore to tell you about their phones. When I went, there wasn't a single customer in the store besides myself and my sister, and 4 employees were chatting away! One tore himself away from them just to inform me that all the phones i was looking at were the exact same and he cant say that any are better quality than the other because there isn't a shred of difference between them- the epic 4g, evo shift and evo 3d. I was like ooookay and left having felt none the wiser about getting a new phone.",0
"Okay, so I finally decided it was time to get rid of my old flip phone and upgrade to a smartphone.  I was super excited.  My grandmother and Iare on a family plan together and she lives in Tucson.  She mailed me my phone and was told that I can just go to a Sprint Store up here and have it activated.  I took my phone into this store and the associate, I think his name was John, told me in order to access the account, he needed the pin # or the answer to the security question.  I didn't know either and I used the store's phone to call my grandma (since sprint had turned off my service a couple days before) and my grandma was giving me a lot of answers that were not the right ones.  I was really upset and couldn't believe that this was so difficult.  I asked to speak to someone else and he said that they would tell me the same thing.  At this point, I'm the only customer in the store and two other associates are wandering around and I know they can tell I'm upset.  Neither of them came over and offered to help at all....He told me that my grandmother had to call customer service to reset the password.  Well, that's a whole other story.  Well, at the end of the day when I met up with my husband (after he had a few beers) he took my phone played around on it for literally less than a minute and magically, it was activated.  \n\nI can't believe that this person is in customer service.  He is an idiot and should be fired.  When I was extremely upset, he showed no emotion at all and couldn't help me at all.\n\nThe next day, my husband and I went into this exact same sprint store, to get my contacts transferred over and I just wish that guy had been there.  We did however, let one of the managers know of the situation the day before.  I'm not sure if anything will be done about it.\n\nIt's best to avoid this store.",0
"This location has always been helpful in the past.  In the last few days I've dealt with several of their staff resulting in the one star rating.  Uninformed hosts, (the people who check you in). I was lied to, by being informed that\nmy phone was worth more as a buy back then it really was.  Given the spring in this person's step, I guess he was getting some bonus for selling me a new phone and/or renewing my contract.\n\nOnce I was making the purchase and renewing my contract (now dealing with someone else, a sales manager or floor manager)\n\n1. I was told my old phone was worth less than what I was told by the host person.\n\n2. I was told that I would not be able to use the money from my old phone toward the purchase of the new one.  I was only able to use it for accessories that I didn't want.\n\n3. I was lured into spending less on the phone by purchasing extra monthly costs like mobile hot spots.\n\n4. I ended up spending $235, after being informed that I would be spending less. About $180.\n\nSo I walk out with my new phone having spent more than I wanted and feeling like I asked enough questions, and was basically lied to in order to get bonuses from the sale of the phone and renew my contract.\n\nSo after having my phone for a few days (iPhone 5) I don't like it.  Over-hyped and under delivered on all fronts. \n\nSo I return it, after I learn that I could have gotten a much better deal by just purchasing online.  I was told that my old phone had been sent out and that I was only able to receive the buy back value. I was asked for my card in order to return the money back to my debit card.  I leave thinking I could go online and order my new phone.  \n\n5.  I was not told that it would take 5-7 days to return my money.  They could have mentioned that.\n\n I returned the phone Monday morning.  It is now Wednesday morning, and I do not have the money, or a phone.\nWhen I made the purchase the money came out of my bank account immediately, not in 5-7 days! \n\nSprint, why are you holding on to my $235!\n\nIts not what the staff was telling me, its what they were not telling me.  It is clear that the staff is motivated by bonuses and not helping the customer.  I certainly hope that this store is not holding my money hostage  just because of the bonuses they did not receive when I returned the phone or renew my contract.",0
"I'll keep this short - do NOT sign up for Sprint service while living in Phoenix, AZ. They do not plan on rolling out 4G LTE in the Phoenix metro area until late 2013 at the very earliest. 4G is not currently available. 3G service is spotty and slow. Calls drop constantly, dead zones everywhere. There is nothing you can do as a customer to get out of your contract after the initial return period, either. I had AT&T for nearly ten years before switching to Sprint, and I made the switch to save a few bucks a month. Huge mistake. See recent service comparisons in Phoenix here:\n\nhttp://www.rootmetrics.com/compare-carriers/phoenix/phoenix-october-2012/\n\nhttp://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2405622,00.asp\n\nOnce again, stay away from Sprint in Phoenix.",0
"This review pertains to Sprint National, not a particular Sprint store.\n\nQuite frankly I'm surprised that all of the Sprint reviews aren't one star.\n\nUnfortunately we've been with Sprint for 13 years.  We get a discount on our plan so we're kind of handcuffed to the rate which is good, but it's the cell phone service which is awful.\n\nIf you're considering Sprint and you live in Arizona, take this into account:\n\n-Cell coverage is spotty everywhere, including central Phoenix.\n-Forget about internet.  I could drive back home across the valley and use my computer quicker than using my Sprint phone.  I don't even attempt to use the internet with my Sprint phone any more.\n-No 4G areas and none on the radar.\n\nAnd I'm not even mentioning their poor/extremely frustrating customer service.",0
"Not for the location but Sprint over all.  HATE IT, HATE IT, HATE IT!  Lots of dropped calls and just plain bad reception.  And this is in the heart of the city too.  Central Corridor.  I wish I could change!",0
Sprint salesman are worse then used car sales man.,0
Communication issues... Bunch of rednecks around this place. A word of warning. Ask for your credit card back because the cashiers just forget it and then if you call back they pretend to have returned it to you...,0
"As Jana described, this location is hit and miss. They seem to move stuff all over the store and an item you think should be in one section, is in a totally different area. It is near impossible to find an employee to point you in the right direction to find what you need. \n\nIf Lowes was closer, I would rarely come to this store.",0
"A few weeks after I became a homeowner, a friend of mine asked my how many Home Depot runs have I made.  What a great question.  The answer:  Way too many.  Since I purchased my house, I have had countless projects and little tasks I've needed to take care of.  This store gets most of my business since it's the closest hardware store to desert ridge.  And I'm glad it is.  It's a great place to shop.\n\nThere's always a free employee wondering around that will drop whatever he or she is doing to help me out.  They always tell me that the more expensive item is better, but show me the cheaper items that meet my needs (and that's the one I almost always walk away with).  They also know how to translate my 'I don't really know the proper way to tell you what I need, because I'm a novice at all this stuff' speak, and make sure that I leave with the right materials that I need to get my job done.",1
"Terrible customer service. \n\n1.) I went to return something I bought online. The guy was irritated I didn't print out my order confirmation even though I had the packing slips. He repeatedly told me how much longer it takes him to complete the return. I offered to look up the confirmation in my email but he said that wouldn't work because he can't scan it through my phone -- uh really? Starbucks scanners work just fine if you have a digital gift card. \n\nI didn't mind waiting the extra 5 minutes it took him to complete the return but he had no problem repeatedly telling me what an inconvenience I was. \n\n2.) I needed help getting a shower head to fit. The first guy was nice but wasn't sure so he referred me to someone else. That guy was rude, condescending, and short. I though Home Depot was supposed to be helpful? \n\n3.) I went to pay and then leave and remembered I parked on the other side of the store. I paused for a second to determine what the best way to exit the store would be (not in the way of anyone, just literally stepped away from the register after paying) and some guy asked me if I had a problem? Uh? I can't just stand here, receipt in hand, for 1 minute? \n\nWill not return to this location.",0
"I swear I am here every frikkin weekend for one reason or another.  This place, like all the other Home Depots, offers everything under the sun for the home and provides excellent service when you can track down a sales associate.\n\nThe thing I hate about this place, and I know it probably isn't their fault, is the parking lot.  It is one of the most horrific layouts every conceived.  The perimeter is a maze of bullsht and I almost get in an accident every time.  I would literally slap whoever came up with the design.",1
"I've done a lot of online shopping, but my recent experience going through this store is the worst experience I have ever had! We ordered a wine cooler for my son on 12/19/12 as a Christmas present, knowing that it would be a late arrival. We received a couple emails stating that the cooler was in shipment, but we had no means of tracking it. On 1/1/13, we received another email that stated that our order had been \""""lost of damaged\"""" during shipment and charges on our credit card would be reversed. We re-ordered on the same day and heard nothing for the next 10 days. Today (1/15/13) we called and they said the order still had not been processed and they were blaming it on the vendor. We finally cancelled our order and will go to one of their competitors to order a similar item.",0
"Home Depot what is this place? It is full of everything you need when working on your house and then some. I've been coming to this location since they opened and remain a loyal fan. Honey do lists are welcome and treated with importance.\n\nThis location is pretty good when you need help or advice. You will see the same people working there several years or more. Makes me feel comfortable and gets me in the mood to kick some orange bucket and get something done. Great rental department if you are in a bind and do not want to purchase the equipment. Life savor a few times.\n\nWow. What department do I spend the most time in on a normal visit? I would have to say electrical, plumbing, lumber, painting, garden center and I think the flooring section next.\n\nStop me already. I cannot get out of here without spending a few Franklins. Definitely the place to get your stuffs. Got to get the crew back to work. Me myself and I and maybe a friend or two. Beers on me fellows. I hope we actually get something done. Yikes!",1
"The return service here is fantastic. I bought something online and then lost the original box, and I'm not even sure if I had the correct receipt. But the guy at the return desk was awesome. He had to get on the phone and pull some string, and got our return to go through. I knew, going in, that we may not be able to get a return, so I am so thankful for this guy that worked so hard for us. Wish I could remember his name, but everyone there has always been fantastic!",1
"My contractor was illegally detained at this location this week.  An overly enthusiastic plain clothes (cop?) with a picture of a badge on his cell phone accused my contractor, and friend of theft (and later changed his tune to say fraud).  With a receipt in his pocket for the roofing materials that he 'stole' that this private dick refused to look at aggressively cuffed him and shoved him around to the back room and interrogated him for well over an hour before Phx Police came on site.  His shoulder was hurt, the cuffs were on so tight circulation was lost in his hands, and all the while a full paid receipt for all the goods was in his pocket.  Right before the police arrived he finally looked at the receipt and said \""""Its from yesterday you thief!!  You lying thief!!\""""  This date on the receipt was Sept 5 2013.  Guess what day it was....Sept 5.  Now, the rentacop changes his tune and said \"""" I never said you stole, you are committing fraud\""""  Once Phx PD was on site, they quickly realized that there was no crime, no theft, no fraud and demanded my contractor be released, which he was.  But he continued to be harassed and threatened by this guy.  they also tried to keep my roofing materials, which the PD wouldnt let them do.  \nI just bought a house down the street.  I am remodeling it starting with the roof, then the paint, then the flooring, then the bathrooms.  I was set to spend 30-40k at this store in the next 3mos.  now, that money is going to Lowes on FLW down the street.  They screwed up bad.  I have also offered the services of my (very good) attorney to my contractor, and that ball has started to roll.  This went well beyond normal detainment/suspicion and civil action will be prompt.",0
"I bought a hedge trimmer, blower/vacuum, and mower. When I got home and opened the box it looked like it had been opened before and later found that it was missing 2 of the 3 attachments. Then I opened the hedge trimmer. There were black marks by the motor and had obviously been used before and refurbished. The mower was fine. \n\nSo 2 of my 3 items had been previously owned and returned/refurbished. If I wanted refurbished items I would have bought them on eBay for 1/3 of the price.",0
"I mean come on guys, its Home Depot! So yes obviously they have pretty much any tool imaginable, paint, lumber and all your other home provment needs.

"We purchased an extended warranty on a Ryobi trimmer. It was told to us at purchase with this extra warranty just bring it back and we will replace it. Well, that does not work. During the first 3 years you must return it to Ryobi and they will determine if it needs a tune up $80.00 or if it defective. REALLY.  As far as I am concerned, won't start, its defective. The extra fee plan that Home Depot sells you will only work after the 3 year expires, so I would guess you need to wait 3 years and then return to home depot. Makes no sense at all. Meantime, I just buy another and put the junk Ryobi in the shed and wait.",0
"I just moved to the area. I'm planting an herb and flower garden in our backyard. I can't say too many great and amazing things about the service. It's a big box store so my expectations aren't high but this store exceeds in all categories. Emily was my assistant she was amazingly knowledgable, friendly and helpful. Everything from helping me select items to loading them in my car. I could not be more appreciative of her skill and friendly disposition.",1
I was very surprised by how nice everyone was. Usually we go to the one in jersey city and everyone there is so good.,1
"I love Saba's! They have a great selection for vegetarians and the best tabouli I have ever had.  Their fatoush is great, also but be prepared to wreak for days.  The only thing I wish is that they would bring back their afternoon happy hour.  I loved going in there and ordering about 6 appetizers and sharing with friends. Maybe for the summer???",1
"There are three things Saba's does undoubtedly right. Firstly, their gyros; they are great and some versions are very unique like their buffalo gyro! Next up would be their fries. They are cooked perfectly and are firm and crispy on the outside yet warm and mushy on the inside (I love my fries like that). Lastly, their lemon rice soup. Let me stress that everyone, unless they're either repulsed by or deathly allergic to lemons, needs to try a cup of this soup! I remember when I used to come here and it was only served on Thursdays and Fridays. Lately it has become so popular that Saba's serves it every day (That should say something). \n\nEverything else that I've tried at Saba's has been good but the three above mentioned items are great and my favorites. They are what keep me coming back and should really be considered for anyone visiting this restaurant.",1
"If you're looking for true Mediterranean cuisine, this is definitely not the place. It's not Middle Eastern either, this is a gyro joint. Every good review about this place has to do with gyros, which is American Cuisine. Otherwise, the reviews regarding falafel and rice, etc. are from people who've lived in Phoenix for too long and don't know any better.\n\nI started by ordering the Saganaki, (fried cheese). I haven't had this in over 10 years, but I remember how much I loved it. The table-side presentation was quite nice, but the quality of the cheese was not. It was tough, not tender and juicy like it should be. I ate half of it and left the rest.\n\nFor the entree I ordered the chicken shish kabob. I was very hungry and this was quite good, but not memorable.\n\nDessert is where everything goes downhill. The baklava was good, not as moist and flavorful as it should have been. But the Turkish Coffee was a disaster. It wasn't Turkish Coffee: There was no sugar, no cardamom, the coffee was poor quality and so was the water. Turkish Coffee is supposed to be \""""sweet and strong\"""" not weak, bitter and without flavor. Please remove it from your menu or invite me in to teach you how to make it. I've been making it for many years and look forward to it when I see it on a menu. Unfortunately, I am usually disappointed. \n\nThe term \""""leaves a bad taste in your mouth\"""" is exactly that. The last thing served in a restaurant is the most memorable. I would have given more than 2 stars if not for the coffee, but I came in mainly for the coffee!  Coffee is not expensive, learn how to do it properly.",0
"I absolutely love this place!  You won't find a better baba ghanoush in the valley!  You have to LOVE garlic to like the baba!  I'm just warning you, your significant other and/or friends must really LOVE you too, because it sticks around for awhile!  The must have is the Flaming Cheese!  What a show stopper!  It's soo cheesey, greasy and lemony! You must also get the lemon rice soup, so good!  Their gyro meat is meatier than most gyro's I've had and has a little bit different seasoning as well.  I recommend the Sleepy Gyro if you want a salad!  Just try this place out and you won't be disappointed!",1
"Ick.\n\nIt was one of those evenings when you toss dinner options back and forth, but nothing really sticks.  \n\nIn retrospect, we should have stayed home.  Even in the barren, food-less space that is my kitchen, I could have done better.  However, lured by an ad boasting a \""""World Famous Gyro\"""" for the bargain price of $5, off we went.\n\nUpon arrival, we were quickly greeted by a man I assume is the owner, shown to a table, and given menus.  A few minutes later, he came back to tell us he would send someone over to take our order.  Great.  Strangely, the waitress that arrived to ask us what we would like to drink couldn't/wouldn't take our food order, as someone else was actually our waiter.  Huh?  Well, we finally were able to order from our real waiter (who was very nice, by the way and the ONLY reason for 2 stars vs 1) and our World Famous Gyros arrived shortly.  \n\nUh, no.  What I found on my plate was a pile of sauce wrapped in paper.  The entire gyro was drowning in tzatziki.  Now I happen to really like tzatziki, but but not to the point that I cannot even identify what I am supposed to be eating.  I scraped off as much as I could, but then only tasted overly salty meat, soggy lettuce and yes, sauce.  After a few bites, I waved the white flag of surrender - I just couldn't do it.\n\nGuess you get what you pay for....",0
"This isn't much of a place for the \""""expierience\"""" but the cheap eats and decent food paired with fast and efficient servers makes this an easy 5 stars. \n\nThey have a few items you can make vegan, the Gyro lunch special is great. You can get just the Gyro for $5 or make it a combo for $6.50. For that you get a nice pita wrapped around some of the better falafel in the valley with lettuce, tomato and tahini and a good portion of a side of fries or other side of your choice.  It's not the best I have ever had but compared to other Falafel offerings in Phoenix, which are downright horrible at times, it's pretty good. \n\nThe service is always friendly but not overly bearing and the servers are usually always the same people at lunch and they are always on top of things and now whats up. The food comes out fast so it's great for a quick lunch spot while still getting sit down service.",1
"Stopped by here for a quick lunch. Looks like a great diversified menu with plenty to eat! It'll take several visits to try everything you want, but I'll base this review on just one.\n\nWe had the saganaki (Flaming feta) for an appetizer. While the taste of the dish was solely melted feta with a little oil, watching the guy light it on fire right besides your table was just awesome. \n\nI personally got the Chicago gyro with fries. The gyro meat was nice and crispy, while the flavors balanced quite nicely. The sauce falling off the pita actually made it more enjoyable, I'd say. The fries were also pretty crispy.\n\nGood value lunch, and I would recommend if you're looking for a fix in the area.",1
"I love the gyros here. They pile on the meat. Great service as well...not going to lie, don't get the baklava it was not good. I have had a couple salads as well and they were very tasty!",1
Excellant lamb shank that falls off the bone. I have also had their gyro and is spot on. I little small so you might have to wait on peak times.,1
"Been here 3 times ate twice. Gyro pita was ok, lamb schwarma had almost no seasoning and last night there were 3 people at the register an no one bothered to acknowledge me let alone seat me, while the \""""wait to be seated sign was up.",0
My 2nd time there. As good as first time. Small little 15 table hole in the wall that serves great food. Good prices and filling portions. Highly recommend the steak kabob very tastey. Will be back,1
"We've eaten at Saba's for years now, and the food was always good. Last night we got our dinner to go, and it was pretty bad. We had the calamari appetizer, which has always been wonderful. Last night, it was undercooked, it was practically raw, and it smelled fishy. If we had been dining in, I would have returned it. I had my usual Falafal sandwhich, and it also wasn't very good. The Greek fries were soggy and limp, not crisp.  I don't know what was wrong, if it was just an off night, of if they are going downhill. I have no desire to go back, and it was one of our favorite restaurants. I give them 2 1/2 stars, because they used to be 4 stars in my book.",0
"Their food is good but their service is so poor I'm never coming back.\n\nTonight was the last straw. I placed an order to pick - up, arrived to get my order and, after waiting 10 minutes and ringing up my order, they finally told me the food I ordered was unavailable. They did refund my money.\n\nThat's the third time that's happened to me in the past six months. It's the last time.\n\nI used to eat here twice a week. A family runs this place. The old man is grumpy and distant, the daughter seems to go through the motions. The son is friendly, courteous and on top of his game...unfortunately, he can't be there all of the time and the rest of the staff doesn't know how to provide even mediocre service.\n\nIt's hard to give your money to people that just don't seem to care.",0
"Fantastic Mediterranean food - I had the chicken shawarma and steak kabob, both were delicious. The baba and hummus were some of the best I've had, and the portions were large. Eating the leftovers tonight. I'm always on the lookout for good shawarma, and this place more than met my expectations.",1
"Stopped in for lunch on a weekday. Service is nothing special, but the food is pretty good. \n\nThe $5 Gyro special was a good value, mint iced tea was refreshing, and the lemon rice soup was AWESOME. I don't know how I had never had this soup before, but I am very excited to grab lunch there again sometime soon.",1
"Noticed the Big WORLD'S FAMOUS GYRO sign out front. walked in, very nice and friendly staff. awesome service. Unfortunately the gyro I got was really soggy, the meat and sauce was everywhere, not fresh, and the bread had a very distinct burnt taste to it. The fries were gross... I don't know what went wrong with this place, but it was packed out with people eating awesome looking salads.... I guess I ordered the wrong thing",0
"I've been here twice in the last few weeks and both times I walked away happy.\nIt's a bit of a hole-in-the-wall dive sort of place but don't let the old tables, chairs and dark interior influence you.  \n\nThe service is very good.  The servers seem to work together so if someone walks by they'll check on you and get you a refill or whatever. \n\nMy first visit I had the \""""world famous gyro\"""".  Although I've searched and searched I can't find where they got the \""""world famous\"""" designation.  It's a good gyro. The pita is light and fluffy.  I'm not sure about \""""world famous\"""" but it's pretty good.\n\nI had a lamb Shawrama on my second visit with a side of balsmati rice.  Again, the pita was very good but I found the dish to be a bit on the bland side.  I'll stick to the gyro in the future.\n\nThis isn't the kind of place you'll want to bring a first date, impress your future in-laws or celebrate a major life event. But, for a good meal with great service at a good price - go for it!",1
"Dropped in for lunch and what a little hidden gem ! Menu outside got our YES to come in .. So many delicious sounding choices was hard to choose from ! Open the door and what cute decor , I was expecting like a taco shop feel or sandwich shop but it's a cute little restaurant hole in the wall place :)  (which I love). We got the fresca pita and world famous with spicy feta fries , so good you just can't stop eating no matter how full you are ! Flavor is good , all the meat is fresh , chicken in mine was all white meat :) no fatty gross pieces . We will def be back !",1
"I've been a customer of Saba's almost since the day they opened. I've seen it go from a very quiet, hidden neighborhood gem to the bustling destination restaurant it is today\n\nIt's still an \""""unfancy,\"""" strip mall, hole-in-the-wall location - the only difference is, a LOT more people know about it and love it, as much as I do!\n\nI can't think of a single thing on their menu (and I've had most of it) that didn't leave me happy, satisfied and wanting to come back the next day\n\nAt least half the time, I've made a meal out of the combo appetizer plates, so I got a taste of many instead of just one. Each one of the many is better than the next. Spanikopita, dolmades, baba ghannouj, tabbouleh (I could live on tabbouleh!)...all wonderful! A more recent appetizer on the menu, are the spicy feta fries (french fries, hot buffalo wing sauce and melty feta) sounds \""""unusual\"""" but is highly addictive. And, as odd as it may seem, I'd like to give a special shout out for their rice. There's something about the basmati/vermicelli that is deeply flavorful and I always want to bring extra home with me. In addition, I'll order the prawns for take out (so the sauce is on the side) and eat them plain...just so I can save the sauce to use on a second meal. If they made a soup out of the prawn sauce...I'd drink it!\n\nMy only \""""complaint\"""" about Saba's is...I used to live in the neighborhood, and it was easy to be a regular patron; but I moved out to Fountain Hills three years ago, and it's no longer quite as convenient. I do wish you'd open a location closer to me!!!",1
"Saba's is one of our favorite local places since the service, food and menu prices never disappoint!  \nOur family of four is routinely sat within minutes and the service is always prompt, polite and welcoming. \nWe have recently tried to incorporate more vegetables in out diet so we have frequented Saba's more often and continue to enjoy this great establishment which has the best falafel pita, hands down!",1
"I wanted to write this review, as a what not to do if you own or run a restaurant.\n\nMy wife and I had lunch at Saba's , the service was very good and the waitress was polite and attentive. The food on the other hand ...  \n\nTo start we ordered the Hums and the Baba-ghanoush, this appetizer came out on white plate looking like baby vomit, the Humus was fine, runny and not any better than store bought, the Baba-ghanoush was sour and tasted past it expire date.\n\nNext we ordered two Gyro sandwiches with French fries, the Gyro was only 8 thin strips of meat on a soggy pita, 5 out of 10. \n\nnext is where the fun began. we went to pay our check, and we where asked the typical \"""" How was everything\""""  ? we at first said \""""fine\"""". \n\nOwners, \""""fine\"""" this is the nice way customer say \"""" nothing special\"""" . \n\nAs we where asked the question, my wife mentioned that the Baba-ghanoush was sour just so the manager or owner that was taking our money would know and maybe go and check on the batch. \nWhat we got was excuse after excuse on why it was not maybe good, everything from we do not have a recipe \"""" we just taste it\"""" to there is a new guy working. \n\nAt no point did she take it off the bill or look like she was going to do anything at all but take our money and tell us to have a nice day. \n\nIf you do not care about your customers comments just  \""""Do not Ask\"""" but when you do ask do something about it !!!.  \n\nNeedless to say we will not be returning.  \n\nManagement or ownership does not care one bit about the food it is serving !! \n\nThis always make me think  ..  do they care about the sanitary conditions in the restaurant?  do they care about the cleanliness ? or is it just too many years doing the same thing, \""""restaurant burnout\"""".  \n\nIf it was the owner shame on her, if it was management, ownership should know and make the necessary changes.  \n\nNever the less the saying goes, one unhappy customer will tell 10 more people abut the bad experience, and this is exactly what I will do. \n\nRichard",0
"Love Sabas!  Great gyros, salads, baklava-we have been taking out and eating in for years. Everything on the menu is great. Quality is consistent and food is fresh and well seasoned. A family run restaurant that is a great find!!",1
"bad food,",0
"I had the falafel pita sandwich and greek fries.\n\nThe fries were nothing special. Just regular fries with a couple globs of feta and basil on top. The fries themselves were not coated in any sort of spices. Failed to meet my expectations based on the description in the menu.\n\nThe falafel pita was also quite unspecial. Just the basics (Lettuce, Tomato, Tahini). The falafel itself was better than most falafel I've had locally, but it was either overcooked or cooked in very dirty oil because the outside was black (No, not dark brown... Black), and it tasted slightly burnt.\n\nThe staff was friendly enough, but while I was waiting for my order, several of them  gathered near the front counter and had several personal conversations within earshot of me. Nothing they discussed was inappropriate, but the congregation of employees behaving so casually made what at first appeared to be a reasonably nice sit-down restaurant feel much more like a low-class diner.\n\nI'll keep looking for better, but this is unfortunately the best falafel I've found in this neighborhood. :(",0
"I have been here a few times and I have never been more impressed then \""""meh\"""".\n\n1) The space is small and cramped. There is very little room to move around and it is dark in side. The paintings and murals on the walls are nice.\n2) The food is average. I love gyros, but theirs is nothing special. I like My Big Fat Greek Restaurant's more. You can get better french fries at McDonald's.\n3) The customer service is ok. Our food came quickly, they tended to our needs/wants, but they did't make our experience memorable.\n4) Their lunch prices are great, so I guess you get what you pay for.",0
"This is my favorite Mediterranean resturant.  George and Liz run the family resturant with authentic family rescipes.  I have a couple of favorite dishes, Shawarma Chicken, Falafel (best ones in town) and Lemon Shrimp Pita  are my top 3 picks!",1
Have been coming here with the family for 20 years.  Family owned and always delicious. I like their mint iced tea and fattouch salad. The sleepy gyro is always great too. My dad loves the falafel pita and my aunt comes all the way from Chicago to have their spicy feta fries.   Try it out!,1
"Terrible food and over priced. I'm happy to pay for just about any price for quality food but $10.51 for a chicken shawarma pita that contains mostly lettuce and yogurt sauce!  I give them minus one star....\nDon't go here unless you want to overpay, leave hungry and have subpar food.",0
"One of the best  hole in the wall Mediterranean places in town.. if you're looking for a super causal small place to have a quick exotic bite, this is a great place. .Parking is plentiful and service is exceptionally fast...\n Their gyros are really good & the housemade dressing for the salad is nothing like I've tasted before. It's unique and so flavorful and tasty. Awesome feta fries and chicken salad too. .Everything I've tried is fresh tasting and super yummy. . All the cooks are Mediterranean so you know the food is authentic which is a definite plus and a must! My husband and I have been here at least 10 times and have never been disappointed..\nI highly recommend this hidden gem!",1
Best food in this town if you like Mediterranean that is. Run don't walk and get over here it is scrumptdillyious!  Sleepy Gyro Salad is my favorite!,1
"I had the amazing butternut squash soup, well selected five piece cheese platter and sommelier's flight selection. They were all perfect. Saba's Mediterranean Cuisine has a great ambiance, and very friendly service. I fell in love with the chocolates which were recommended by our friendly server.",1
"We started Desert Dawn 4 years ago and it was the most wonderful experience for my son, his now kindergarten teacher is impressed, now my 18 month old goes here, all the teachers and staff are amazing, loving and caring. They know every kid by name and the kids feel like they are part of a big family. \nThe kids love the huge playground, learn about gardening and caring for animals. They often have fun things for the kids, magic shows, balloon show, Halloween & Christmas parties with face painting and a lot more fun events.\nI know some families who left and a few months later are back, others let their kids enjoy being kids one more year and stay at desert dawn.\nSome teachers have been at desert dawn for years and you can tell they love what they do. Ask for a tour and you will want to be a kid again to have the same experience!!",1
"We were invited to a party here this weekend and....\n\nThe employees don't care about their job.  The food is disgusting, even down to the watered down soda!  \n\nI asked for a table to be cleaned and the employee just smeared it around, I ended up cleaning it up.\n\nHold a party there and Chuck E. Cheese is lackluster and the employees can't even fake a good time for the kiddos!  The tables are jammed so close together that when kids are sitting back to back, another child can't even get through.  I saw multiple childeren trying to squeeze their way out and ended up falling and throwing their tokens everywhere... this included my own child.  \n\nThe \""""games\"""" eat your tokens and good luck finding an employee to get the token back!\n\nThen to top it all off, it is not the cleanliest place and  I got a stomach bug from there and am still miserable 2 days later!\n\nKids love it, but we need to be their protectors and keep them away from places like this. \n\nSpare yourself, find another venue for a party!",0
"Just went to this location and my family and I are very disappointed. First off the stamp girl didn't greet or say good bye with no smiles. The girl at the ordering register was nice but she's the only one working that area, when she asked for help her fellow employee ignored her. Never saw a manager! Not that I exactly needed one but hey maybe I could describe the food in person instead of yelp. So the soda was watered down, the pizza was greasy and tasteless. I asked for blue cheese and ranch with my wings and only received ranch. My wife refused to eat and so did my 15 month old son and he was hungry. Paid $36 bucks two drinks medium pizza and small wings. That's the food experience, will never go back.",0
I was in and out of here so quickly!  They made me feel welcomed,1
"I would give this 4.5 stars and not 5 stars because sometimes the head cashier chick gives me the stink eye when I go in.\n\nThey have a great selection of dog and cat food. Not just the standard stuff that Petco and Petsmart have, but real organic and high quality stuff. Of course, that means some of their food is more expensive than you will find at Petsmart. However, they have some stuff that are less expensive for your pup or kitty, such as collars, toys, catnip, treats... Its kinda dark in there, and smells like a barn but worth going in and checking out. Plus, its right next to grovers park :)",1
"Pet Food Depot is great!  They only carry high quality feed in this joint.  The staff is knowledgeable and willing to make recommendations.  More often that not, these guys even load the ginormous bags of food in to my car for me! The food and treat selection is amazing and the prices can't be beat.  If you are looking for Kibbles 'n Bits, you won't find it here, but if you want the best for your pet, come check out everything Pet Food Depot has to offer.",1
"This place is good depending on what you're looking for. I'm going to write this from a reptile enthusiasts' view. Simply put, this place is the worst. Animals all housed improperly, I've seen some snakes that were rescued from here, it smells, and it has been this way since the 90's. If you're looking for reptiles, avoid this place!",0
"Very friendly & helpful staff, they carry specialty dog food at great prices. Love coming here for my fur kids! They also offer low cost vaccine clinics on saturdays",1
"Went to get my dog's food at the Pet Food Depot (Cave Creek/Grovers) and I saw a bunny in a cage on the floor, scared. He/she had food and a carrot but no water. I told an employee and after a bunch of \""""that's not my rabbit\"""" comments, finally someone gave the bunny water. The sweet young man who checked me out told the manager that a customer wanted to buy 2 parakeets. The manager said to put them in a paper bag because they're out of boxes...really, a paper bag? The young man said the customer specifically wanted the birds in a box and the manager said \""""we don't have any boxes, should I grab one from the sky\"""" and walked off. What a huge turn-off! I found out that the manager is the owner's son. \nI have been coming here for 8 years and this was my last trip here. There is a store a little further away (Western Ranchman at 32nd St/Paradise) that sells the same specialty dog food I buy, so they will be getting my business from now on. I have always been treated well here but after the flippant comments from the staff in front of a loyal customer, they obviously do not care about me or the animals they sell.",0
"Horrible horrible experience.  Is selling puppy shots that are not refrigerated.  Also did not tell us that the shots needed to be refrigerated, although what good would that have done since they weren't in first place.  Went to return them, they refused.  The guy named Bob says he was the owner, refused to give his last name.  I asked for more information he refused, and as he wheeled by he cursed me but I heard it.  I left the defective shots there, so now he has my money and the shots.  AVOID at ALL COSTS.   I have since learned parvo distemper shots not kept at right temperature can kill puppies.  I brought this up with the \""""owner\"""" Bob and he said he didn't care",0
"This place is great.  The store looks better and better everytime I go.  We've been shopping here since 2007 and have always had friendly, helpful staff.  They stock great toys and offer good community minded services (vax, etc) There's something for everyone.  Even the customers are nice!",1
"This place it's great. Really reminds me of a country feed store. They carry everything you need for any size pet, the staff is very helpful & they have the best prices around. I was paying 10\u00a2 pet cricket at petsmart & they sell there's in bulk 500 for $20. Which is a lifesaver when your son has 2 growing beardies.\nAnd I love how there's always baby chicks & ducklings chirping away. They're so cute!\nP.S. anyone looking for fly/flea spray for pets or livestock- AVON SKIN-SO-SOFT spray oil is the best cheapest non-toxic bug/mosquito repellant out there.

"Rude staff! Terrible customer service.\n\nI went in Saturday 8/30 around 4:30PM. I was in a rush to make it to the Vet Clinic that closes at 5PM. In the midst of my rush, I realized I forgot a leash for my 80lb retriever. I figured it wasn't a problem since they have leashes in the store.\nI walk in with a squirmy puppy in a dog carrier bag on one shoulder, while trying to walk my 80lb dog by his collar. I walk up to the grungy-looking cashier and say, \""""I'm so sorry but I was in a rush and forgot my dog's leash at home. I am just going to the Vet Clinic, so can I please borrow one?\"""" Clearly he sees I have both of my hands full. The jerk says, \""""No, but they might have one back there for you.\"""" REALLY? \nI was previously warned by a couple family members to avoid this place like the plague, but I thought I'd give them a fair shot. \nI will never recommend this place and I will never return. This place has forever lost my business. But I will always recommend the place that is just a few minutes away with wonderful customer service!",0
2.5 stars: 2 hours for a detail and no wi-fi :(,0

No problem if you want to get something to eat while they wash your car, they will hold it for you until you come back which is convient.",1
"I always have the hardest time at car wash facilities because I feel like the cleaning is always sub par, no matter what *package* I purchase.\n\nI have dogs, and my dogs have lots of hair. They don't call them German shedders for nothing. So when I pay $25 plus for a car wash, I'm really wanting them to vacuum the car really well. That's never the case. Apparently, the only way I can get my interior dog hair under control is if I get another interior detail package. \n\nAlso, how hard is it to wipe a dashboard? I always have to remind them to wipe the dashboard and console. At this point, I could have saved myself a grip of money and done it myself.\n\nAlso, watch out for the coupon specials. Not all the employees know how to honor them and will try to charge you for something else entirely",0
"BF used to praise this place and his truck always looked good, but I think when they changed companies the place is not as good. First time he took my car here it came back immaculate. Now, I've come here three times since (we bought coupon packets) and windows aren't cleaned as well as they should and ive asked two separate times for them to vacuum my trunk and both times it wasn't done. I've gone to full hand car washes in other towns that are cheaper and take more time really doing a good job on your car. Not going back here again.",0
Terrible experience. Always trying to up-sell. Took my wife's SUV thru yesterday.  Paid for the top of the line wash. Interior wasn't complete. When I pointed out the dirt the attendant handed ME a rag. Thanks for nothing!  My last visit to this place.,0
"For those parents who need to take kids in for their first haircut, or one of the first few haircuts, I strongly recommend a place like this. Cool Cuts has a nice play area for kids while they wait including video game stations for the older kids. A basic cut is $16.95 which is average. You can find cheaper prices at Stupidcuts and Hateclips, but you will make up the difference by waiting at least an hour for a moron to cut your child's hair badly, and your child being scared to death in the process. Spend a few bucks more and go to a shop that specializes in kids. The kids get to sit in a regular chair or a special car or airplane chair and watch a video from a decent selection while the snippers do their work. My little boy just had his third haircut ever, and Maryam (sic) did a great job. I think she set the land speed record for cutting hair. He was seated and done within 5 minutes, and all that while having a screaming fit the way only an 18 month old boy from my family can do. They will use scissors if the child can stand it, and clippers if she has a squirmer. I recommend calling ahead for a reservation or you will have to wait (or shop with your wife while waiting!).",1
"As a former happy customer of Lollilocks at Desert Ridge (which sadly closed), we decided to come here for my 4 year old daughter's haircut.  I was very unimpressed with the atmosphere, cleanliness, and employees.  \n\nThe older woman that cut my daughter's hair barely talked to her, other than to ask her what video she wanted to watch. I feel that if you're going to cut kid's hair for a living, you should be a person who's good with children.  She then proceeded to spend the next 10 minutes trying to sell me hair products.  I finally just walked away after trying politely in vain to let her know I wasn't interested in buying anything other than the haircut.\n\nThe place seemed like it was in need of a remodel, didn't look particularly clean, and the full court press on the hair products was a complete turn-off.  I won't be taking my kids back, unless I'm desperate.",0
"I will not be getting my sons hair cut at Cool Cuts for Kids again. \n\nYou see last November we had his first hair cut done there, and then we left town for a couple weeks, where we noticed that it was grossly uneven in the front (it was nearly an inch longer on one side of his forehead) We hadn't noticed because we nearly always do his hair in a style that had hidden the mistake. \n\nwhen we returned home, I called the location that I had taken him to, only to be told that because it was over 1 week since the cut that I would have to PAY for another cut!!! \n\nI was thoroughly disappointed at the lack of customer service! so sad, $17 for a child cut that is not even right is too much.",0
If I could possibly give no stars I would. I have been to this location now two times. First time I had an appointment and I waited for 35 minutes with a 2 year old. This was the second time I went waited over an hour with a 2 1/2 year old and than was told they couldn't get me in today by Karen. Who is very unprofessional and no patients with small children anyway. This place is a joke. Wonder why I was told when I moved here NEVER to use this place. Now I will spread the word as well.,0
"I brought my 15 month old son in for his first haircut and I will not be going back. The woman who cut his hair was not the type of kid-friendly personality I would expect for someone working in that kind of place. She was very aggressive about trying to sell me hair products, even argumentative about other products and what is considered organic. And now that I look at his hair cut, it's uneven. I will just fix it myself instead of going back there.  They do have videos for the kids to watch, but overall it does look outdated into there.  I wish I had just gone to a regular place.",0
"Less than impressed! We usually go to the Cool Cuts at 7th Street and Bell, but this one occasion, the location on Cactus was more convenient. We won't be back! The lady cutting my boys hair was very interested in selling hair products to another customer who came in AFTER she started our cut, even tho there was another stylist there, sitting in the back. After 5-10 minutes she came back, but was very impatient. \""""Sit up, don't move, tilt your head\"""".....all reasonable requests if done in a polite manner, and IF he was moving around, which he was NOT.  She did not seem a very kid-friendly person, despite working in a kids only shop.  The place seemed rather grimy too. :(\n\nInterestingly enough, we have only had great experiences at the 7th Street location. Friendly and polite, and a very clean shop. \n\nGuess where we will go in the future?",0
"The concept of this place is great, but it's really kind of a dump... and WAY overpriced.  The lady today told me that \""""it is easier to cut when it's clean\"""" (because he was a little sweaty), but failed to mention that she would be tacking an extra $3 for an already overpriced $16 haircut.  What a rip off.  Not to mention, the store is dirty.   My kids love coming here, but sadly this is our last time.",0
"Had a pair of pants taken in and caught my heel on the hem so half of it needed to be sewn. $18 for the alteration and $5 for the hem (really a few stitiches?). Told me they would be ready on Wednesday (dropped off on Sat) didn't make it there until Friday, could I come back after 5? How hard is is to call and let me know. Returned on Sat. They were linen, would it have been to much to press?",0
"I took a $228 pair of Citizens for Humanity jeans in to K-Family to be hemmed. Despite the obvious quality of the garment and my expressed concern about the stylized appearance of the jean that would be compromised by the hem, they handled the job carelessly, hemming and rehemming it too short -- two times -- and leaving the messy stitching where it had been artful. I feel sick. You get what you pay for here, a quick job, no art.",0
"I am a shoe repair store regular, because I prefer to maintain a good pair of shoes rather than shop for a new pair. I tried this place when I first moved to the area. I have never been told quite literally that my shoes were not worth repairing. When I told the man that I had had the soles replaced several times before and that price was no issue, he told me it wasn't worth it for him and to go buy a new pair. So I took them a half mile down the road to Cobblestone and they had them looking like new in no-time.",0
"Do NOT confuse this with the CJ on Thunderbird. Same name different owners. \n\nI went here on a suggestion from the guys at Batteries Plus on Cave Creek and Bell Rd. He said they have a great burger/frys/drink combo. \n\nShoo Nuff! The darn parking lot lingered of fresh hickory smoke and I knew it wasn't from the mexican food place. Good Start.\n\nI walked in and headed right for the bar. I judge a food establishment by the bar.... just kidding. \n\nThe bar was large, clean and in front of several tv's. I waited for about 2-3 min for the bartender to see me because she was talking to patrons. (this does not bother me, instead makes me enjoy the place more.)\n\nI asked about the grub/brew special and she said. \"""" it is either a burger, frys and drink (draft or pop) OR ~~WTF there is an or??~~ a pulled pork with frys and a drink (draft or pop) \n\nWell after smelling the smoke from the car I knew I had to get the pork. Plus I had a fresh from the dry cleaners WHITE shirt on. \n\nI get my Mt Dew... yeah! and two seconds later a nice large size pulled pork on sesame seed bun, with a ton for frys and a pickle spear. \n\nThe pork was PERFECT. Great flavor, cooked slow, nice meat with no fat. The sauce was better then average but lacked a little. Maybe a spicey bbq was what I needed. The frys were bar frys, cooked perfectly and plenty to eat. The pickle was well a pickle. \n\nThe Mt Dew rocked!\n\nThe bill came to under $6 and I was happy. I didn't even spill on the shirt. (I do smell like a camp fire but I like that)\n\nThe place is large but with a small feel. The servers are attentive but not intrusive, the food is great from the one sandwhich I ate. I did signup for a \""""discount card\"""" they offer. It is a point system and you get discounts off of the food and a special something on birthdays.",1
"Everytime I go to this places I am surprised.  I just expect it to be bad but the food is actually really good. I have had a salad, a sandwich, and a melt. All were good good. : ) The service is always friendly to boot.",1
"I have visited the Casey Jones pub 3 times over the past year or so whenever I visit my mother who lives in Phoenix. Everytime I go I have had a great time! Take for instance this past weekend, they had UFC 116 on for free. Not many places in California even show the fights and they definitely are not free! Also after 10 p.m they have $1.50 small pitchers of domestics. SOOO that speaks for itself!! The food is typical barfood but it is very good so you can't go wrong there.  I will continue to go here whenever I come to phoenix!!",1
"I've decided that this is going to be my new Sunday football hangout.    Nothing fancy, kind of a dimly lit place but they show all the football games, have a solid, good-quality menu, the burgers are decent, the prices are low, the service is top-notch and I can sit back, enjoy whatever game I'm watching and not be bothered.     I've been to their location on Thunderbird as well and this one by FAR is a lot better.     Not sure why it is, but the service seems better and the food sure as heck tastes better.   They make some pretty good BBQ here as well.     Not a gourmet dining experience but they live up to the expectations of a sports bar and then some.",1
"You can't getting a passing grade from me if the table you get seated at is dirty.  Dirty table -50.\n\nOrdered a Queso appetizer - the chips were kind of stale.\nOrdered a french dip & got a philly instead.  One of the ladies at our table ordered a chicken salad with raspberry dressing.  The salad presentation was POOR.  The salad came on a plate? It was missing walnuts (which she later brought out).  The salad was DRENCHED  dressing.  The chicken in the salad was apparently good.\n\nThe two racks of ribs we ordered were good.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I have been to this place before and the staff is friendly, their prices are good and the food quality is usually good. Plus \nthey have a really good happy hour. I made it a point with the FIVE other people I brought with me to go here because I really liked it in the past.\n\nThey had some gentleman playing guitar in the background, he was kind of difficult to listen to as well.  This visit was a disappointing miss for me, but I will give them another shot.\n\nA generous two stars for this visit considering the filthy table.",0
Love this place.  We go all the time.  Wings are the best cocktails are good and well priced.  Don't confuse with the terrible place with a similar name on Thurnderbird and 43 avenue.,1
"Fun environment, friendly staff and decent food! Short, sweet and to the point!!",1
"I'll start by saying the service was great. Drink prices were good. But for three people to go and spend $75 is not your $ that you give it.3 drinks for $10= good. The rest of my tab was for 36 wings, burger, rings and sweet potato fries. Now compared to other bars like Tailgaters the same order of food plus a bucket of beers and 4 Malibu n Cokes = $45 with food being just as good. So if you want bar food this is not the place to go. By the amount of empty seats the problem is your food pricing. Your a bar not a fine diner!",0
"My wife, son and I have been going to Casey Jones now for quite some time, however this most recent time we went the quality of everything kinda seemed to jump off a steep cliff.   We went in with some friends the other night and ordered some of their newest burger the \""""Juicy Lucy\"""", after ordering them medium, we were rewarded with two burgers that not only seemed to be bleeding but the cheese the oozed out of them reminded me of a horror flick where the guy gets stabbed and his guts just pour out.   After taking the burgers back to the kitchen and being assured the would be taken care of, the burgers deffinately came back cooked... almost with a propane torch, talk about hockey pucks! and to top it off we didn't even get cheese in the new burgers making them not so.. Juicy ya know.   Where as before I would have preached this place to others, I can honestly say we won't be making a return trip until they get a better cook in the kitchen, didn't think it was possible to botch a burger, let alone four! this place has astounded me in the wrong direction =/",0
"My creepy best friend is a huuuuuuuuuuge Green Bay Packers fan. He's a Mexican that grew up in LA. Go figure. \n\nMy birthday just passed and we decided to gather a bunch of people and party like it was 1999. We took a few tables, I drank like a sailor, and had their mouth watering wings. The burger I had here was very very...tasty. Yes, yes...tasty. \n\nThe reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because there was a lady singing who should not quit her day job. Bless her soul, she had the heart of a champion, but a bar like this is probably not the best place to be discovered. Other than that, this place is pretty mighty morphin power awesome. \n\nI still think Green Bay isn't that great, but that is coming from a Raiders fan. :(",1
"As a diehard Packer fan living in Phoenix, I have been going to Casey Jones' for 4 seasons almost every Sunday.  Each year has progressively gotten worse than the last.  Service is appalling, food quality is dirt poor (except for the wings), everything is filthy, and the hospitality, overall, is terrible.  A week ago I went in; it started the season off on a bad note... I even called the manager over to explain that I am a loyal customer and hadn't seen it this bad EVER.  He didn't have much to say as I gave him some gentle feedback on my experiences, he didn't even apologize or thank me for my loyal business.  I pledged to myself I will never drop another nickel in that place again after that.  Not even for a DIE HARD Packer fan...",0
"Ok ok so this place looks like a dump, yes. HOWEVER I have been here a few times for the burgers and wings and they are delish! Burgers are made to order, exactly how you ask for them. Normally I order a burger medium and it comes well well well done. Here you order it medium, there it is nicely light pink and juicy. And the wings....ah the wings. If you are a hot wing fan like I am, you will appreciate them. They are big, juicy, and crispy. I like them medium flavor and they are just spicy enough. Service is decent, decor is dated, but the food is worth the trip.",1
"I was there for a busy Monday night game and was extremely impressed with the service.  I give kudos to the owner who actually plans for big crowds.  The interior of this place is fun.  If you have kids they'll enjoy the model train that travels around the place.  (I secretly wished it would poor beer when it neared my table, but......).  If you're a Packer fan than go no further as this seems like it's Packer headquarters.\n\nWe had the wings and mushroom burger.  The food was good, but a little cold.  \n\nOverall though it was a fun night with good service!",1
Great place for food! I really like their Philly cheesesteaks & honey hot wings.,1
"One of the worst customer services I have experienced in awhile. The waitress didn't seem to care immediately after we got our food. Waters were empty and she even asked if I want another beer, I said yes and she said \""""of course you do\"""". Guess what? I never got my beer and the only time after that she was interested in clearing off our table. Again still had empty waters and didn't ask if we needed anything else. \nAlthough, I do have to say they had this song bingo game which was fun only to be ruined by the poor service. \nLastly the check. There was a comment card great i thought heres my chance to share feedback oh i couldn't because it was pre filled for us with \""""excellent\"""" scores all the way down I have pics to prove it. Well I won't be visiting anytime soon. Thank you to the waitress Marci!",0
Great rotating beer selection. Great staff. Colorful characters nightly lol.,1
"Pretty much the perfect Sunday football experience. If your a Packers fan, this is the place to be, but if a fan of any other team, you might want to stay away because your game may not be on and if it is, it will be on a very small and older TV. I went with a Packers fan and luckily I could see my Giants getting mauled on another TV.\nThe bloody Mary's were excellent at $3.50 a pop (ask for a pickle), but no other drink specials. The philly cheese steak was the best I had in ages and is in my Top 5 list. White American, ribeye, onions, sweet and bell peppers and the cheese curds were authentic as possible. Friend from Wisconsin said the curds were the best she has had since home. Marcie was a great waitress, just too bad the packed bar had to leave sad after a wild loss.",1
Casey Jones is where I go to eat. Their sandwiches are great. Sean is the best. Marcie is a great waitress.,1
Came in today on a whim during my lunch break with a coworker. Place was your average bar an grill with basic food you would expect. They had pretty good lunch and drink specials. I ordered the green pork burrito from the lunch special menu and we got some wings since they were also on special. Wings were average and sauce was clearly store bought but they were juicy and cooked well. The burrito again was good but nothing special. What really held this place back was the service. Our waitress was stone faced and unfriendly. She overcharged us for the burrito and then acted like we were inconveniencing her and didnt even apologize. Im ok with mistakes as things happen but to act that way was ridiculous. I would probably not bother coming here again.,0
"I'd give it 5 stars if they had sports audio instead of the earl 90s pop music. Sheryl Crow does not belong playing in a sports bar.\n\nFood is excellent; service at the bar is awesome. I've never sat at a table, so no clue on general seating service. It does tend to collect a rough crowd, but generally well behaved and friendly. OTB can be fun way to lose $40",1
"Suggested by a friend who has lived in the area for a long time. Its about a mile from our new house. Its a Green Bay Packers bar, but don't let that scare you. They have an insane menu setup! Went with Cheese Curds and Chicken Funditos and I was thrilled! Great/Friendly bartender. Wife loved her Salmon Salad. \nSeriously only going 4 Stars until I try some more of their food, but I feel 5 Stars easily lingering here!\n\n***NO FIREARMS ALLOWED***",1
"Our first time in. Our server was terrible, no refills didn't ask if I wanted another drink, got my order wrong. Seemed like she was taking care of her regulars just fine but was avoiding our table. Her loss since I'm a server and would have taken care of her. \n\nFood was average for a sports bar. A little on the expensive side but alright portions. \n\nProbably won't be going back.",0
"Bad customer service, my bar tender is still washing dishes when my friends is ready to pay.",0
"Wow, here's a place I hadn't been in in a long time! I think 2006 was the last time. I had a great experience here. The last time, a man from Australia, sat next to me & we talked like we were old friends! Great friendly place. \nI need to come back & visit because it's right next to the pawnshop I go to sometimes....I will very soon, indeed!",1
The food was delicious and our server was excellent. I was disappointed about having to wait past our reservation time to be seated.,1
My family has been going to PV Eyecare for many years. We have never had any issue with the staff or Dr. Rios who is the best! Appointments are flexible and prices are competetive. This is a no pressure place- unlike other places. You can buy your frames/contacts  there or they will give you your prescription and you can go elsewhere. I am not familiar with any of the other doctors that are there but if you need a great eye doctor- try Dr. Rios.,1
"I was a patient of Dr. Bridgewater's for over ten years, and when he passed away their offices referred me to Dr. Ric Rios and the transition has been a blessing in disguise. I am a suffer of keratoconus and had a cornea transplant in 08. Up until I saw Dr. Rios, have never had quite the success in fitting a contact lens. I have a hard lens in the right eye and a hybrid in my left. The hybrid has me seeing better than 20/20 out of it. AMAZING! I will soon have a hybrid put into my right has well. The only regret, if there is any, is the somewhat snotty old receptionist who calls to confirm appointments. Beyond that... Doctor Ric rocks. Thanks Bud!",1
"I have been going to Dr. Rios for several years and I think he is great. My eyes are a weird shape and I always had difficulty finding contact lenses, but he was able to determine the perfect brand. I agree with several of the other posters regarding the facility being a bit dated and the office staff not always being the most professional and pleasant; however, I care more about my physician being competent and professional than his staff.",1
"I have no idea why this place is so highly rated. In October 2012, I came to this establishment saw the doctor and received the prescription. I did not get my glasses right away because there was a mix up with my insurance and I would need to wait until January until my insurance reset. \n\nCome the new year I called the office to set up time to get my glasses. At this point Paradise Valley Eye Care had informed me they did not have my prescription on file because I saw Dr. Christiansen. Well come to find out the doctor had no record of my visit. It was not until April that they found my prescription and had it sent over. I went and ordered my glasses-finally there was light at the end of the tunnel! My appointment was for early June to order pick out my glasses. I was told my glasses would take 2-4 weeks to arrive. July comes around and I have yet to hear if my glasses had arrived. I called the office and they stated my glasses arrived three weeks ago. Assuming positive intent and the possibility the my cell phone did not receive the call, i let it go. I went in to try on my glasses and became incredibly sick due to the stigmitism. They said nothing could be done and I would need to see the doctor again to be re-examined. I had my appointment the next day and it was determined I would not need a prescription with stigmitism. Reordered my glasses and started to play the waiting game. \n\nAgain I was told it would take 2-4 weeks. 4 weeks had gone by and again I never heard about my glasses and had to call. Again I was told I was called 3 weeks ago and they had my glasses. I had them double check the number to make sure they were calling the right person, my information was correct. I arrived at the  Paradise Valley Eye Care, and the ladies at the front desk had informed me I must have been mistaken because they did not receive my glasses and did not give me a call. I reminded them that I called them and they told me the glasses were there. After more research the front desk had said that they had record of the glasses being received and even signed for them-but they could not find them. They offered to have me pick up a new pair of glasses and wait 2-4 weeks or go with the ones I had. I really liked the ones I picked out, so I decided to go with the glasses I had originally picked up. Again the same old story, I would need to wait 2-4 weeks and they would call me to pick up my glasses. As you can imagine the same situation occurred again, where they \""""supposedly called me\"""" and the glasses were there. \n\nNow on September 14th, I went in for hopefully the last time to get my glasses. Again tried on the glasses, and what do you know-they only removed the stigmatism from one of the lens. So I knew immediately when I started to get sick. Come to find out there were two prescriptions, one that showed no stigmatism and the other that showed one. Ironically they could fix this problem on the spot (It is my wonder why they did not do this the first time around)-Finally after almost a year of getting my initial eye exam, I have my set of glasses. \n\nNow Eric and some older women who would not give me her name (which I found really odd) were very sympathetic to my situation. They gave me a eye glass case, a pretty one. But truth be told after this ordeal I expected something more than a damn eye glass case. In summary this office is unorganized, unprofessional, horrible customer service and a place I highly recommend on not using. The office had several opportunities to show great customer service in all of my times that I went back to the office-but they severely failed every time!",0
"I wouldn't go to this one ever again! \nI understand I have a high power but the glasses which they gave were so thick especially at the edges, they were literally blocking my side vision. \n\nI will never recommend this to anyone!",0
"I went here to get contacts in July 2012.  before i went back to see the doctor, i was told that a contact lens only exam was $99.  I told the girl at the front desk that $99 was all i could afford.  I had $120 and that was it.  when i got done with the exam, my bill was $200, and of course I couldn't pay it, because I only had $120.  I guess they didn't hear me when I said I only had $120.   apparently, i got more than just a contact lens exam, even though I SPECIFICALLY STATED that I wanted ONLY the CL exam . When I couldn't pay, i told them i would pay the rest at a later date.  i did go back a few months later and paid the remaining balance and bought some contact lenses, which were fine.  today, i stopped in there because i really need new glasses.  my current pair was about 7 years old.  i informed the girl at the desk of this and i informed her that  i was unwilling to pay for a new eye exam after i was informed that the 18 month old script was expired. she seemed annoyed that i was standing up for myself and she said she would see what the doctor would say and i looked at frames.  i picked out a $150 frame and brought it to the counter.  now it's a different lady at the front.   she looks me up in the computer and says that i don't have a glasses prescription on file. Why don't I have an EYEGLASSES SCRIPT on file?  WHY??  i guess the $200 dollar eye exam didn't include an eyeglasses script.  IS THAT CORRECT? she said she would ask the doctor if it was okay for me to buy these glasses, but i didn't want to wait around for them to ask permission from the doctor if it's okay for me to spend my $$$ in their store, so i left.  can't say what he would have done, but my guess is that he'd wanna charge me another $200 to tell me that \""""everything is fine and your script hasn't changed\"""".  my script has changed VERY LITTLE since early 90s.  If it has gotten worse, it's not by much, as I can still wear the glasses I received in the US Army in 1992 and they work fine (though I would not wear them in public :) i don't have insurance and need to pay cash and i just needed some glasses. I DID NOT NEED ANOTHER EXAM,   I'm tired of this highway robbery.  this place seems to really like the money grab so beware.   Most people with insurance don't question extra charges because they know their insurance will cover it.  \n\nIn response to Dr. Rios' angered reply.  I lied?  how come I paid $99 on my first visit and then returned at a later date to pay the remaining balance?  I combined your two charges of $98 and $99 respectively, and called it $200.  Deal with it.  Why doen't $200 cover for a glasses script?  What lobbyist out there wanted a STATE LAW to renew eyeglass scripts annually?  Can you say \""""Special Interests\""""???  Blackmail?  Where do you see blackmail? That statement about blackmail alone makes me think you are wacko.  I got my lenses duplicated and that is perfectly within the law of the State of Arizona to do so.  I am completely satisfied with my new glasses and I see great.  Thanks for your concern about the health of my eyes, though!  How would he know if my script was the same since the 90s?  He only saw me once and I brought no previous records with me.   Disrupt your office?  I may have debated briefly with the counter girl, but I made no scene or raised my voice or anything like that.  I do have an exuberant personality, I don't deny that.   Dr, Rios, do you think you are insulting me by saying I should seek charity if I cannot afford eye care?  I was told on the phone before driving down to the office that the exam would cost $99.  When I got the the counter it was twice that amount.  I could afford it,  but it wasn't the amount I was told I would pay. I specifically told them on the phone before I came down, that all I had was $100.  That's why I had to return at a later date to pay the remaining balance because I was unable to pay the full amount.  As far as my previous contacts not working, Dr. Rios specifically told me that certain cleaning solutions on the market were ruining the disposable contacts making them unwearable.  He mentioned that the \""""Eye Care Community\""""  had recently discovered this information.  I went back to using the peroxide cleaning solution,  same solution I used in the late 1980s and I haven't had any more problems with disposable contact lenses.  Why did I come back to the office to get glasses when my first experience was bad?  BECAUSE I didn't think that after 18 months, my script would be expired.  I was wrong.  Since BOTH of my visits involved money grabs, I decided to write this review.   Inaccurate and malicious?  I don't think so,  I'm just stating my experience, and of course my opinion.  You don't have to share my opinion, but you do have to deal with this statement regarding your business remaining here on yelp.",0
"This place is horrible!!! I had an appointment to get my four kids in amd they canceled bc they didn't have a doctor in, then why make the appointments in the first place???? And even then they couldn't give me another date that would work with me. I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE. THEY ARE UNRELIABLE! !!",0
"Everything went well. Nice, comfortable atmosphere. The Doc knew what she was doing, even pointed out and old scar on my eye that I had never been alerted to previously! Didn't get the actual hardware there (kinda pricey). Would recommend to anyone!",1
"Absolutely repulsive attitudes with no help whatsoever. Needed help and no one could give me a straight answer. Came back to store to return something, and the cashier was on the phone and would not help with my return. Finally after waiting forever she returned my internet purchased items and gave me store credit.  She also told me i could not use my store credit online which is where i would need to purchase my items since no store within 50 miles had my size. I was a bit upset. Went home, and looked on the back of the card she gave me for store credit and it says i can use this card in store OR ONLINE.  Please, know what your saying before you give off false info to your customers. \n\nParadise valley wet seal, i will definitely not be returning. And have your employees smile every once in awhile.. Instead of looking like a sticks up their butt.",0
"quick, friendly service!",1
I needed a ring resized. They did a great job. Very friendly workers. I was also able to use a 20% off coupon. I am happy.  Thanks!,1
This place is the biggest rip off! They should be ashamed wanting to charge $29 to change a battery on a cheap Timex watch. I could not stop laughing. They would not tell me how much the battery cost. I took the watch to Victoria at Wall-Mart who charged me the price of the battery which was about $4 and she replaced it at no cost in about 3 minutes. Thanks Victoria!  I also got 2 batteries for the price of one. Screw the warranty at Fast-Fix. Ha-ha.,0
The owners are very nice. They've been here for over 10 years. The shop is clean and they can always get me in without an appointment. They do good work and they always remember me even after years. The only thing I wish is that they would remove more of the dry rough skin on the heals. I still have to do it myself at home.,1
I take my previous review back! I had gotten my nails filled here 3 times and then noticed mold growing under my nails! Yup MOLD! I was happy because they did my nails quickly and got me in and out but there is no price to pay for MOLD! I will never be going back here again!,0
"THE BEST NAIL SALON THERE IS!\n\nI have been going to this salon for eight years and let me tell you- they just keep getting better and better. Each one of the workers are kind and professional. My sister and I love the atmosphere of the salon and the work we get done is always beautiful. I have recommended this place to dozens of people and will continue to do so in the future. Go in, let them take care of you and I guarantee you will not regret it.",1
"I've been to this location a number of times, but I have to admit that this last visit was the best.  I was immediately greeted and brought to the appropriate section, where a friendly blue-shirted employee helped me figure out whether the \""""one-size-fits-all\"""" laptop power adaptor would work for my netbook.  We sadly determined it wouldn't work, and I walked towards the exit, only to be met by the same greeter.  She helpfully told me about Best Buy's parts program, expressing regret that the all-in-one solution wasn't going to work for me.  \n\nWhatever they've done here, color me impressed.  Figure out how to hang on to the management staff at this location, Best Buy!",1
Always very helpful! Went in with my Great Uncle and they were very attentive and gave some great advice to what we were looking for.,1

Says nothing.\nI say I need an Ipod Classic.\nHe tilts head toward his microphone and calls for a key to open the case.\nOpens case, removes Ipod, nods toward cash register.\nAsks if I am part of some rewards program (he mumbled so I'm not sure what program he was asking about)\nRings up sale.  Tells me the amount.\nI pay.  He pushes item towards me then says 'Do you want a bag?'\nI wait for him to say thank you. . . not happening, he never says another word.  \nI say 'You're welcome'\nEnd of transaction.\n\nHello Fry's Electronics!",0
"Lets just say when a customer walks in, your personal conversation needs to come to an end.  Sadly the Reps in the cell phone department didn't do that, and didn't offer any assistance until after I said Lets go.  When we asked about a specific phone, they had no idea what we were talking about so we had to leave anyway.\n\nNo wonder they are going out of business, it's more of a playtime for the employee's as apposed to a work place.",0
"Thank you, thank you geek squad for getting my computer up and running again. This is my lifeline. They were very helpful",1
"Don't buy here!!! They are liars and cheats. I brought in my hp laptop I bought at this store ($699.00) to the geek squad because it wouldn't power up. They said they had to send it to Kentucky for possible repair at a cost of $35.00. A week later \""""Kentucky\"""" called said it was to old to fix ( it is 4years old) & I should buy a new one. So I did. I gave the old computer to a friend, he changed the battery & power cord & voila!!!! It works fine!!!!! Really?!?! Luckily I hadn't picked up the new one yet so they reluctantly gave me my money back. Never again will I use this store.",0
"Went into this store looking to purchase a rooftop antenna. Wandered the store twice looking for anything like what I was looking for, could only find the small inside type. Passed by so many employees who either diverted their eyes away from me or they were in such deep conversation with their fellow employees that they did not even notice me . I just got frustrated  and left the store. The only person to talk to me was the guy at the door who said hello and goodbye. Went home and purchased online. This is one of the reasons I think stores like this will fail and shut down.",0
"I have a misleading cited to shop at best buy again. I bought my laptop there in December, after an update it stopped working. Spent hours on the phone with the manufacturer who told me Best Buy would cover this they didn't care to even look at the computer. Its funny I brought it in the original box and packaging and everything. Horrible customer service.",0
I will never buy firm thus store again. Firstly the Samsung Experience People couldn't help me and couldn't even get their software up to reboot my tablet. ....tgen when they did they couldn't figure  out why my tablet was stuck on the boot up......horrible people who don't know a thing about their products. I am in the store now and no person to be found to give me back my tablet....called fir the best But Manager and he is nowhere to be found either.....WTF.....horrible customer service from everyone....never will I buy from Samsung or Best Buy again.....hope their happy losing a customer for life.,0
"Went to this Best Buy with the intention of looking at, and maybe buying a kick ass audio system for Christmas. Not a single person could be found to help me, standing there for over an hour. The store wasn't even busy. I was in the Magnolia section and the regular audio section. I went to find help, but there was very little to be found. The few kids who were working didn't even seem to notice I was there, and walked right by me several times . Oh well, I guess this is one reason Best Buy is in trouble. I'm taking my $$$ elsewhere.",0

Been coming here for years and have always been happy with the tailoring. Quick turn and reasonable prices - certainly worth not having to do it myself.,1
"Not much for chain restaurants, but this place delivered a quality burger.  I had the triple prime cheeseburger that was cooked exact to my order, service was attentive and prices are decent.",1
"l have been to various Bath & Body Works all over the US, but this one at PV Mall is the one I visit most frequently.  All products are cruelty-free and absolutely smell divine.  They have a huge variety of lotions and potions, soaps, fragrances for home and even carry an entire men's line.\n\nBath & Body Works not only as the cutest packaging, they also have all sorts of sales and coupons available year round to make sure you get the best deal.\n\nMy favorite lip glosses and balms from C.O. Bigelow are carried here as well as the entire Patrica Wexler face care line.  \n\nThis place is awesome.",1
"Great Staff....Great service....within walking distance of my Apt......and the Candle deals are simply awesome. Starting back in November I have purchased at least 22 candles to this date (Feb 18th 2013). I mean the 3 wick candles usually go for 20 bucks apiece but they have been virtually giving away candles at Bath and Body Works since before the holidays of 2012. I mean 2 for 22.....buy 2 get 2 free.....4 for 30 with a coupon......8 bucks a piece with another coupon.....30 % & 40 % off candles....I mean it has been crazy. So needless to say I look forward to buying many more this year when these glorious sales come around...until then Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!",1
I've had dinner here so many times. But more recently it seems that the food quality and friendliness of waiters have deteriorated. The one thing that's consistently great is the bread.,0
My wife and I went for dinner last night. We got there and where told it would be about 11minuites to be seated. It took 4. Our Waiter (Cameron) was there at the table very quickly. He got our drink order and my Wife ask if they had Prime Rib. Cameron said it was running short. He took our order and was back quickly. They where out of Medium Rare Primerib. He brought us menus again and we started over. In a few minutes he was back with a piece of the oven roasted Fillet. We sampled it and decided to go with that. Cameron was on top of the Ice Tea and service was amazing. The manager stopped by to check on things and I expressed how great Cameron was doing. The manager comped our desert and gave me his card. He said call ahead and they would save some Prime Rib in the future for us. This is the best experience I have ever had at any chain restaurant.,1
"It had been a long while since we'd been to Outback so one weeknight recently craving steaks we returned.\n\nThe menu has changed (evolved?) since I was last there, more choices with steaks seasonings, expanded menu offerings, etc.  Frankly it was just confusing to me.  I just want the old Outback steak thank you.\n\nOrdered the 8oz sirlion & shrimp w/ the famous house salad and grilled asparagus (new item) for sides.  Well, the steak was pretty good and cooked as requested .  The 3 little shrimp were somewhat bland and did not excite, salad was skimpy from what I recalled from the past, and the grilled asparagus was Ewwwwh.  Asparagus looked like it had been waiting for my order and then reheated or regrilled.  Did I mention that our waiter assured me this was a very popular item receiving many rave reviews?? - oh, and I got to pay $1 upcharge for this little vegetable gem.  Tough stalks and had a smoky taste that didn't work either - I was NOT impressed.  Crazy perhaps that I am ranting about a vegetable but I was really looking forward to this item and Outback really blew it.\n\nService was mostly efficient although the waiter bordered on being hovering and too familiar.  Out of my face please I am trying to eat here.  \n\nOverall I have to say this was a disappointing experience.  Outback is not cheap by any means.  There are plenty of other better places to go for steak.  Outback would do well to return to what made them famous in the first place (it's the food, stupid).  Based on this experience, it will be a long while before I decide to go back to Outback.",0
The food is below par. I asked for the best steak available and it was horrible. It's not as good as I remember from 7+ years ago. There are too many other local places that are better.,0
"3 Stars, more for the food than the service. I sat for 10 minutes before ordering my drink. Not because I didn't know what I wanted mind you... Actually I'm subtracting one star because 10 minutes is too long to wait to order a drink. Most corporate restaurants give servers 60 seconds to get a drink order.",0
"Our waiter smelled horrible! It wasn't even that busy where I could understand him having B.O. We orded soup and mac and cheese for our dinner. Im not a big fan of the steaks from here. Its hit or miss and id rather not risk a miss and end up with a steak that isnt tender. We could tell right away that our waiter had an attitude after we ordered. We werent very hungry and i was craving the mac and cheese. It is a kids dish but i would order it if they raised the price and made it a dish on the menu. Its so good when they dont make it watery, which they did this time. We had to wait almost 10 minutes after we ordered for our bread and for my drink. After we got our food our waiter never Checked on us. He walked by a dozen times but no refills and no more bread. There was also a small fly buzzing around and a Tiny gnat on our table. When we got our check there was a charge for 2 drinks we did not order! I was furious at that point. When I told the waiter he didn't even seem surprised but rather almost annoyed! I get that our bill was not going to be huge but it doesn't mean our service has to be so bad. Whenever I split a dish or order small items as my entree I always leave a good tip. The bill usually comes out to about $20 like this time and normally I would have tipped $5-6 if the service was good or even decent. I just can't believe he thought he could add onto our bill and get away with it!",0
Never disappoints - love their salad with honey mustard and then their sinful sunday.  Filet is what I get here.  Always get good service and never really have to wait for a table at this location.,1
"This Outback is my fav IN ALL of AZ. :) Not only Is happy hour all the time, but the staff is very nice. The food isnt' fresh but, like I said the booze and staff are great!!!",1
Andrew comp'd over $30 of food because on a previous order our food was not prepared correctly. Superb customer service.,1
This is regarding an experience I had at Outback this past Saturday.  We arrived around 6:30 and were told it would be a 30 mins wait.  We weren't seated until almost an hour later and it only went downhill from there. We all ordered salads with our entrees but the entrees came out before the salads.  What?  Dessert was comped but the food was still medicore.  This is why I try to stay away from chain restaurants.,0
"Being a long time fan of Outback, I decided to try it for lunch.  Not such a great idea, as it turns out.  They offer unlimited soup and salad, for $7.99 and a few selected other items that can be paired with soup or salad. Bottom line, you are nickel and dimmed to death.  If you want a Wedge Salad (as opposed to a House or Caeser Salad), it costs $1.00 more; if you want French Onion Soup (as opposed to Baked Potato Soup), it will cost you a $1.00 more; if you want cheese on your burger, it will cost you a $1.00 more.  These extra charges were annoying and seemed unnecessary.   \n\nThe Caeser Salad had way too much dressing, the Baked Potato Soup was way too salty and the Outback burger was way too dry (maybe I should have paid the extra buck and got cheese!). \n\nI will stick to dinner at Outback, from now on.",0
Great sirloin steak and excellent friendly wait staff! We'll be back!,1
"Ill never return to this location. I always order my filet and veggies with no butter/no oil... And tonight I ordered the same....\nExcept what came out tasted and looked covered in oil, butter and seasonings. \nThe worst part is when I asked about it....\nthey denied saying no oils were used. It was obvious in looks and taste. \nYet after my meal someone else in my party commented on the lack of flavor- sure enough they cooked his meal with no butter, oil or seasonings....\nYou know if they would have listened, they likely would not have lost a customer. \nWhen I order this same thing cooked this same way at least 2x per week from various outback locations.... you would think I would know the difference! \nIt becomes very obvious! \nThis is the second and last time this has happened at this location... Never again as I'll NEVER be back.\nThat was the worst service I've ever had at outback or anywhere. \nIn future I'm driving out to the new outback locations in Gilbert.... Where they ALWAYS get it right!",0
"Came here for dinner because the hubs wanted to try out the AYCE shrimp.  I ordered the small filet (medium rare) with mashed potatoes, grilled shrimp and a side salad.  The filet was tough and took me a while to chew and chew ... and chew each bite.  The mashed potatoes were good, shrimp was salty and my side salad was decent.  The hubs got a filet with the AYCE shrimp - the shrimp were tiny. Probably bay shrimp.  And they gave very small portions.  He tried the scampi, buffalo and fried.  The scampi, if we were forced to choose were probably the tastiest out of the three.  We also ordered the cake pop trio for dessert and it was SO sweet we couldn't finish it.  The only good experience throughout the whole thing was that our server was very friendly.",0
The service is super slow!  We've been waiting for our food for an hour!  Still waiting...,0
I don't know if it was just a bad day or a bad waiter but I didn't enjoy my visit. Arrived for lunch at 1:26pm and was seated immediately. My fianc\u00e9 and I ordered an Ahi Tuna Salad and it came out within 10 minutes. We ordered our entrees (crab stuffed Tilapia) when we received the appetizer. We sat and sat and sat. We were talking and when we realized we didn't have out food we called the waiter (who never came to the table after seating us and delivering the appetizers) he said the food was just done and coming out. An hour later. Needless to say the food was cold which means it was done and left sitting and the waiter didn't provide prompt service. I'm sorry we won't be coming back here. Very bad experience.,0
"Walked in and had to wait for the host to show up.  Got seated git drinks order, all fine no issues.  I ordered the Crab-topped Steak and my wife the Crab-stuffed Shrimp.  When the food arrived what I got was a steak that had a (frozen) crab cake placed on top and some sauce poured over it.  I ordered my steak medium and it arrived rare.  I promise you blood poured out when i cut it.  It was sent back and they made another this one arrived med-rare and I thought, screw it and said it was fine.  you could easily tell they had smashed the steak onto the grill with that flat iron thing, I do not know its name,  The one side of the steak was smooth.  My wife got shrimp that was rubbery and had a cut up crab cake placed on each shrimp.  Not worth our time and not worth our money.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe liked her sweet potato and my garlic Mashed potato was real good but.....\n\n\nthe manager came by and chatted with us and said we could come back and he would personally cook for me but I think I will not be going back.  We stopped going to this chain years ago because the quality of food had serious dropped.  we hoped that time had fixed this, but it had only made things worse.",0
My steak was like rubber. It was full of tough gristle. I will never return.\n\nThe waitress was very friendly and attentive. Unfortunately that does not make for terrible food.,0
Got the Ribeye steak & this being a steakhouse & the best cut I expected a thick juicy tasty steak. Far from it! What I got was all fat not even edible I had to search around just to get one nibble of steak! Are you kidding me? This was terrible. I sent it back and they took it off my bill. I won't be back changed my opinion of outback!,0
"Shopping for a bed is never fun. This place has a large selection to try out when making your decision. Very large showroom and very friendly service.\n\nTrying to find one that will last for a while and still be comfortable is tricky. They just don't make them like they used to. We tried the sleep #, the up and down ones, the really cheap ones and some that make you cry when you hand them your plastic.\n\nCame to the conclusion to stick with one of the Name Brands that I've had luck with before and go mid-range on the spending this time. Did my homework before coming in so I had all the numbers down and a plan of attack. Who pays retail?\n\nOur sales person Dustin M. was very helpful and friendly. He started us off by picking the firmness and the type of material we desired and then gave us plenty of time to try each beds. The wife and I narrowed it down to a couple of beds but played the poker face. I knew the store down the street was having a big sale and I told him. Dustin got out his pencil sharpener and gave me the numbers that I needed and then some to close the deal. Sweet!\n\nThanks Debbie ... for making shopping for a bed easy and affordable.\n\n4.5 Stars",1
"I am having bad back problems because of the bed that I bought here three years ago. When it was first delivered, it didn't feel like the same bed I tested in the store.  The one in the store was comfortable (soft but firm support) and a good deal.  The one that was delivered was hard and overall uncomfortable. Not at all worth the price I paid.  I called them and said that it was not the same bed but they insisted that it was. The tag says it is, but my back says it's not.  I suspect a bait and switch.  I could have and should have returned it, but I thought maybe it just needed to be broken in.  Nope.  I hate my bed and am looking for a new one--but won't be buying one here again. Ever!",0
"The small business woman's best friend.  At least it was mine. Though my business was more micro than small, Kinko's helped me with everything from creating invoices to routine faxing.  The folks there have always been pretty helpful in giving ideas - though with some folks were more interested in talking to each other than helping a girl who at the time didn't know the difference between Word and Excel but needed to create a marketing document.  Ah, silly girl.\n\nNow that I'm a more savy business person, I've used their services for massive training documents and big ugly audio visual gunk.  Yea, that's about how much I cared about all that. By my favorite thing about Kinko's is their fun paper and envelopes for personal use.  It's weird to buy a card there, but when you realize you've spent the last 16 hours working on some work crap that you've been doing at that pace for the last week - you might want to pick up a mushy \""""I love you\"""" card for your significant other who's putting up with it all.  Or maybe a card for the Anniversary/Birthday you're missing while you go back to the office?  \n\nI'm telling you - Kinko's knows what you need before you do.",1
"Dear FedEx Office / Kinkos, you have saved my ass on numerous occasions, and I am forever indebted to your fabulous hours and helpful staff. \n\nBeing the procrastinator I am, this place is my haven on Sunday night when those nasty Monday morning presentations need to be..well, presented. Went in here again last night with the same scenario, and got in an out with no problems! Living on my Mac for so long caused me to feel like an idiot when it came to the Windows operating systems, but with a little assistance, I got it! 10 page presentation with color images for 8 bucks? Heck yes.",1
"I've used this location on quite a few occasions.  They're open 24 hours, and the staff is always friendly (even at 2 in the morning).  I've been extremely pleased with the quality of print services I've received.  This place is great if you procrastinate on a school or work project and need something printed up real spiffy-like in a hurry.",1
"I walked in this morning. There are 2 employees standing at the counter. NEITHER looks up to even say hello to me. (Although, as what looked to be the morning shift was arriving over the course of the 15 minutes I was there, they said good morning to everyone who worked with them that walked through the door) \n\nThis place is a \""""print center\"""" and they could not print on simple card stock that my regular home printer can print on. So lame. The card stock kept jamming so they wouldn't print anymore for me, even though it was printing them beautifully, they were just jamming when they were coming out so they had to keep opening the machine. \n\nAt any rate, 1 star because for being a print center they should be able to PRINT.",0
"So, I had a job interview early this morning.  I forgot to print the attachment yesterday, and when I got up this morning, I almost had a heart attack!! I looked to see what kinko's was open early (as most of them are) but was close to where I was interviewing at.\n\nFor starters, they open at 6AM. This, my friend, is a huge lifesaver!  I called them first thing, and talked to a really nice guy and got the email address for the store itself. I told him that I would be there in half an hour to pick it up on my way in.  He was really cool, and helped me out with what I needed.  After I emailed him, I called the store back and made sure they got it. I gave him my name and told him I'd be there in half an hour.\n\nI walked in, literally 30 minutes later and the paperwork was ready. Granted, it's not a huge complicated project, but being that I didn't bother to check the night before, it was last minute on my part and lack of preparedness.  I grabbed the paperwork, paid the $$ and took off, all in a matter of minutes.\n\nThank you Kinko's for saving my ass.  Thank you for being open early and being quick and cool about stuff, and helping a sister out.  I don't know what I would have done of they weren't open so early and so readily available to help.",1
"POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE:\nCalled to get a price for one print job, and the guy who answered the phone interrupted me three times to quote prices before hearing the details of the print job. Needless to say, his first two quotes were less than half what the correct price for the job. They would not have honored the first two quotes. The guy was rude even when I thanked him for his help.",0
"Not cool: Putting me on hold for \""""one minute\"""" and forgetting about me. Also, how hard is it to have my order ready on time?",0
"I've had several items bound at this location.  I will agree with one other review which states that staff doesn't look up or greet you when you come into the store.  This is very true; but they get the work done which is the main objective.  It's still better than Dave Chapelle's \""""Pop Copy\"""".",1
"If you go to Fedex office you better bring your lubrication. Because the prices to use the internet service will rip you a new asshole. \n\nPlan on spending like 50 dollars if you want to write a document or scan something. By the time you finish you will be so stressed from the amount of money that is accruing..to the internet going slow so that it racks up dollars without you even able to do anything that you will want to rip your head off. I recommend calling the libraries near you to see if they charge money to use the internet or do some digging on where you can pay decent prices and not have your asshole torn apart and bloodied by the FEDEX ORIFICE PLUNGERS.  Don't go to Fedex or you will be FEDUP!\n\nThe guy that works there didn't like me cursing but if he was in my shoes he wouldn't like the fact that it took like a half of a days pacheck to pay to scan a couple of items. \nThe corporations are now ripping assholes in the American people. This is because most of the large corporations are \""""Illuminati\"""". The Illuminati are the families who control the world and they own most of the fortune 500 companies.

"Bleh.  \n\nOur service was pretty bad...food took forever to come out, waiter got our drinks wrong and was overall unattentive.  \n\nOnce the food finally arrived it was decent but nothing to write home about.  I had the cobb salad and my friend had the chicken sandwhich, both pretty average, although portions were big.  \n\nNote that you have to order sides like fries seperate--which annoys me.  Cheesy decorations...blah blah blah",0
"Awful. Everything is way too salty and overpriced. You can get a better burger across the street at 5&Diner. Cool decor, though.",0
"The food was awful, but the service was fantastic!  The service is the only reason it's getting 2 stars.  My husband had one of the burgers and he said that it taste like a frozen burger patty.  I had the Kobb salad...It just wasn't good.  We did have the nacho app...Half the cheese wasn't melted, and if you wanted any beans or meat on it, it was extra.  Over all the nachos weren't bad--only because they were part of the half price apps during happy hour.  It was pretty crowded--I literally think my pony tail was touching the girls pony behind me, and there were a lot of kids.  I would say, don't wast your time/money here.",0
"Good food, nothing super delicious that makes me have cravings. I haven't been here in a long time, as in when the fries didn't come with the burgers (you had to order them as a side item). However, now they do come with them and are still endless, but I did notice the burger prices went up to allow for the burgers to now come with fries...something that is always expected at any burger joint. They do have sweet potato fries that you can order, big plus. \n\nService has always been great, they are really quick with getting drink orders in and served to you. I've ordered a bunch of items from salads to fish tacos, and of course, their burgers. Everything has tasted decent and I'm not really sure what qualifies as having \""""Fine Burgers\"""" in a restaurant title, but I don't think Islands has it. The restaurant itself is very clean and the bathrooms are well kept. The only downside is the acoustics in this place. It can get very loud when its busy and almost annoyingly loud when there are a few kids in the joint.",1
"My last trip on Monday the 14th was not very good.  I sat in the bar and just wanted to grab a quick burger and beer.  The bar was pretty empty, even though Monday Night Football was on.  I sat down and after a few minutes the bartender came over and I ordered a Fat Tire.  He tells me that they don't have Fat Tire but they have some other beer and that it tastes JUST LIKE Fat Tire.  I passed on his recommendation and went with a Kilt Lifter - he seemed pissed that I didn't go with his recommendation.  \n\nI ordered a burger and he said \""""you want it cooked medium right?\""""  Typically I would say thats a little presumptuous but hey its Islands not Morton's.  The burger came out and was maybe mid-rare, closer to rare and was very greasy.  The bartender asked about 10 seconds after he delivered the food if \""""Everything looks OK\"""".  I said sure it does and he never stopped back to refill my beer, ask if I wanted a water, or ask how the burger was.  He was busy talking to his girlfriend who was also working.  \n\nI ate about 1/2 of the burger and asked for the check.  The bartender brought the check and didn't say a word, or ask why I only at about 1/2 of the burger.  Overall a very disappointing experience.",0
"Wow! I was just here a few months ago. How fast can a burger place go down hill? I wish I would have read the recent reviews before eating here. I would have gone to In-n-Out in a heart beat. \nJust like previous patrons have stated, the burger tastes like it is freezer burned, the 'Endless' fries are not very good, the service is lacking, the bartender assumed I wanted Med. their version is very pink and greasy as well. \nOnly positive is the beer. \nNext time I'll drive out of my way to a close Red Robin. Everything is much better there.",0
Tonight my bf and I was here the service was alright the buggers was good the fries was a bit over cooked,0
"We arrived for lunch and were seated immediately.  Our waiter, Alonzo C., looked a bit harried, running between tables.  He came to take our drink order and we also gave him our meal order.  We thought it a bit strange that another table that came in after us and ordered food after us had received their meal before we did.  After 25 minutes, Alonzo came by and asked if we wanted more iced tea.  We asked if our food would be coming soon.  Soon another waiter stopped by (which we assume was the manager as he did not introduce himself) and apologized for the long delay in bringing our food.  After that either Alonzo or the manager stopped by every 5 minutes or so to see if we were okay.  When the food did arrive, the vegetables that came with the turkey burger looked like they were freezer burned and fresh from the microwave.  I would expect from a restaurant like \""""Islands\"""" that vegetables would be fresh.",0
"Yesterday was National Hamburger day, so it was my patriotic duty to partake in this directive. I was greeted by a smiling hostess and proceeded to the bar where an NBA playoff games was playing on the flat screen TV. I made it in time for happy hour but no hamburgers other  than sliders were on the menu. \n\nThe Hawaiian is what I wanted and at around $9.00 I was ok since it came with Onion Rings. Order arrived with 4 yes 4 onion rings. I asked the bar tender/ waitress if this was it, and she assured me it was. She did offer me another side but I said no. Disappointed with the onion rings, I cut my hamburger in 1/2 and proceeded to eat. Frankly it was boring, slice of pineapple a bit of Teriyaki and 3/8\"""" slice of onion on a bun that was as boring as the hamburger. Waitress brought me 4 more onion rings which were the highlight of the meal. Unfortunately, others arrived at the bar, a heavily tattooed Mohawk wearing individual with girlfriend. Every-other word was F this F that. Ate my burger drank my Blue Moon @ $5.75 for 16 oz. The bill  came to $16.33 and I left a $20.\nSorely disappointed with this chain that lost its way. 4 stars to the waitress who knew how to handle a disgruntled customer. In and Out would have been a better choice.",0
Yaki Tacos were yucky! Skimpy on the teryaki and dry. The fries were hard and cold. Place is going down hill fast. I wont eat here again! WOOF!!,0
"DO NOT ORDER YOUR HOLIDAY PIES AT BREADCRAFTERS!!\n\nI made that mistake last Thanksgiving!!   I ordered a pumpkin pie and an apple cranberry pie.  We had family in from North Carolina and enjoyed a loverly dinner.  Then disaster struck.  I bit into my apple cranberry piece of pie and THERE WAS CHOCOLATE IN IT!!!  A whole layer of chocolate under the apple and cranberry.  I couldn't believe it and I was so embarrassed.  It tasted horrible.  The pumpkin pie was crappy too!!!    \n\nTo make matters worse I tried numerous times to contact the owner for a refund by phone and through their website and heard nothing then finally sent her a message through facebook!!   I heard back from her and she admitted to me they rarely check their email off the website - thats good business sense!. She asked me for my address to send the check to and gave it to her.  A couple weeks went by, received nothing so  I emailed my address again.  \n\nTo this day (June 14th) I still have not received a refund!!!  We used to lunch there once in a while but now WE WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN!!!  And this year I will make my own pies!!!  Lesson Learned!!\nIt shows me that they do not care about their customers!!",0
This is my favorite place for sandwiches and salads.  The staff here are the friendliest I have encountered since I moved to AZ (the staff must all be from somewhere else!).  The bakery items are also very good.,1
"I haven't been to Breadcrafters on Tatum in quite some time.  We arrived around 1 p.m.  by 1:30 p.m. the place filled up quickly.  \n\nThe boyfriend had the Park Avenue Chicken Salad  the most popular sandwich on the menu with white-meat Chicken Salad made with Grapes and Almonds & served on Raisin Walnut Pecan Hearth Loaf with\nLettuce & Tomato. $7.50 and I the Bourbon Street Ham with  Provolone, Mixed Olive Relish, Lettuce, Tomato & Vinaigrette on Ciabatta Loaf. $7.25  Delish.  Next time I would try a softer bread.  The Ciabiatta was a bit tough to chew.  To drink I ordered the Feeling Nutty Latte with a shot of hazelnut and walnut syrups.  Ben had the Passion Fruit iced tea.\n\nCan't wait to try the breakfast menu.  The website iscurrently under construction.",1
"I have been going to Breadcrafters for the past five years, and it is HANDS DOWN one of my all-time favorite sandwich spots in Phoenix! Here are some of my favorite food choices:\n\nSandwich: I typically build my own sandwich which I like to call Old Faithful. It is a perfect combination of turkey, provolone, lettuce, tomato, with their parmesan pesto spread on a baguette. The parmesan pesto spread is OUT OF THIS WORLD - you haven't lived if you haven't tried it! Their chicken salad is also fantastic. They serve it with lettuce and tomato on their walnut raisin bread, and it is great! They have all kinds of great sandwich creations, all of which I've tried. I am being completely honest when I say I haven't had a bad sandwich at Breadcrafters.\n\nSalads: My favorite is the Napa Valley chicken salad. It has sliced marinated chicken with bleu cheese crumbles and grapes and is served with a champagne vinegrette. It's delish!\n\nPastries: All the pastries are great, but I love their scones and muffins. They are huuuuge portions, so you could make a breakfast out of a scone and cup of coffee. Their desserts are out of this world as well. I highly recommend the apple fritter, brownie (insanely chocolatey), lemon raspberry bars, and their molten chocolate chip cookie (it's a dark chocolate cookie with raspberry).\n\nBread and Dips: My favorite breads are the sourdough, french country (a lighter sourdough), viennese (an egg bread), garlic parmesan and regular baguettes. The dips that they sell are beau monde (a delicious herb/dill dip that's great with veggies), parmesan pesto (my fave!), roasted onion gorgonzola (another fave), and an olive tapenade. \n\nAs far as the service goes, everyone is always SUPER friendly. It's one of those \""""cheers-esque\"""" places where everybody knows your name :) I will be a life-long customer, because this place really knows how to do good, fresh food!",1
So my girl friend works close by and we thought we would try this place for some dessert! I hope the Food is better than the dessert. I can not say I was real impressed but it could have been what I ordered. The bread looks great and the few sandwiches I saw looked good. The thing that bothered me most about this place is that the staff did not seem very friendly. Seems like a nice bakery and a good location but I the staff could make this place a lot better and more inviting!,0
"Nice place surrounded by many fast food places. No grease here!  Breads are wonderful, but customer service was just ok.  Great pastries and part of the Belly loyalty program.  Super dog friendly as well with the outdoor seating.",1
A real bakery (items not frozen or pre-packaged). Real small place. Unique breakfast and lunch offerings.,1
"First time here.  It's too bad the food is pretty good because the service is horrible. It wasn't busy and the cashier girl gave us such an attitude as we were trying to decide which bread we wanted (it only took us 2 seconds max).  Food took awhile which is fine because you can't rush good food, right?  Well, then the cashier girl forgot one of our items, made me wait while she helped more customers that walked in after I waited in line to get the item, gave me more attitude when I asked her for it and the gave me the greasiest looking soup imaginable.  It's too bad the other food items in our order are pretty good because we won't be back.",0
An small interesting place to try. I liked the French toast. We did not like the chia tea.,1
"I love this little cafe! It has such a positive, friendly energy and the food and service are excellent! Everything is freshly made, nothing is pre-packaged. Very little indoor seating and ample outdoor seating that's shaded and cute. Definitely on my \""""Keeper\"""" List",1
"Stop for breakfast this morning  the portions were good the quality was not there. The food was delivered cold and on the tray to us and not place in front us on the table. The girl was not focus on customer service. In today market were you can pick from many places for food  i look. for quality, and price. They fail today in both areas.",0
"Unhappy customer here! I ordered orange scones (apparently they don't do plain scones???) for a tea party for my husband's niece. I  called in the order in about a week before the party. \n\nPicked the order up on the day of party, only to find out that they had made cranberry scones.  I hate cranberries. I pointed this out, and their response was they could make some, but they would not be ready until the next day. Not helpful since the party was that day. \n\nCome on guys. Not only that, but they weren't really scones. Scones are a little on the hard side hence the need for cream and strawberries. These were more like big flat muffin tops. Big fat cranberry muffin tops.",0
Stopped in for an iced tea and ended up buying a chocolate croissant and a loaf of bread! The croissant was delicious. The tea was fresh and not bitter. Their menu looked great. I'll definitely be back for food sometime soon.,1
"We stopped in for an early lunch last weekend after our workout and fell in love with this place!  We split a turkey and brie sandwich with raspberry preserves on a croissant, each had the rice and albondigas soup and I splurged on a chocolate mousse...perfection!  Fresh ingredients, inventive menu and super friendly staff.\n\nOf course I am a big fan of the dog friendly patio with views of the mountains as well.",1
"Stop by this AM for coffee and sandwich. The food is little better but still need help on the presentation side and when you state on the menu \""""egg your way\"""" I should be able to order it my way. After it cost $ 9.00 for sandwich which is high.\n\nService could of been better and prices lower. Save yourself the money and go across the street and save $ 4.00 on the same items.",0
Love this cafe! Such yummy breakfast foods and I always indulge in their yummy dessert items! It is super clothes to the mall and easy access! I also have ha lunch here a couple times with my boyfriend and it was so yummy and portions are a great size! Overall a very delicious bakery!!,1
"Nice and cozy atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating. The staff is very nice and welcoming. Though they may be in the middle of making something for another person, they are good about acknowledging you are here.\n\nThe pastries are excellent, and they are huge. You definitely get your money's worth. I had the turkey and avocado sandwich which was very good. They serve breakfast, soups, salads and sandwiches.",1
Always late!! Have never had an appt that I did not wait for over an hour. They have wasted my time for the last time.,0
"Expect to wait as long as 45 minutes to an hour from your appointment time until you actually see your doctor. More times than not. Consistently more often than not.\n\nIf you are late, you'd think they wouldn't make a big deal since late is their standard operating procedure.  If you are 15 minutes late, they give your spot away and you are likely to get your appointment canceled. Not a very fair treatment seeing how they can be 45 minutes late regularly, but you cannot be more than 15 minutes late.\n\nAlso, blood draws end at 4:30pm sharp. They fail to tell you this when you schedule an appointment to get a lab order from your doctor.\n\nThe doctor is good. It's just the office policy and many of the front desk employees that are unyielding and like to disappoint clients and not provide 100% customer delight.\n\nDoctor: 2 out of 2 stars.\nCustomer Service in Office:  0 out of 3 stars\nTotal:  2 out of 5 stars.",0
I love this guy! He's old school and a very competent Dr.!,1
"Is there a more snobby place to shop in the valley...  The selection is incredibly limited, everything's priced at least twice as much as it should be, and the staff is so incredibly unhelpful, if they were any less so the front door would be padlocked shut....",0
"I remember when I thought Abercrombie was totally BA. I spent weeks trying to convince either one of my parents to take me there so I could buy a hat with a hula dancer on it and maybe even a sweater with a line through it. \n\nEventually, one of them caved, probably because of my birthday, and spent way too much money on way too few clothes. \n\nAt some point I figured out that Abercrombie was actually completely lame. I don't know if its my tastes that have changed, or their clothes, but in either case I have no plans of dropping in to A and F anytime soon.",0
"Sometimes they have additional 30, 40 or 50% off clearance items depending on the season.\n\nI found a pair of lightwash destroyed \""""erin\"""" skinny jeans for under 10 bucks in the clearance section way in the back.\nScore!\n\nXS sell out really fast.\nIf you're a size M or L, some good deals in the clearance section if you look",1
"I must admit, I still love this place. It's like a nightclub that sells clothes. Loud dance music, too much cologne in the air, and employees who are both courteous and stuck-up. I totally dig it! \n\nI was hesitant on this endeavor though. I have worn through my old A&F jeans that I bought near 2002. I loved the quality and the fit of my ol' jeans and was hoping to find some more just like them. Scratch that, they only had new styles of jeans. As I was browsing I couldn't help but notice that A&F had fallen into the nasty trend of selling mostly \""""skinny jeans.\"""" And seeing as how I am neither skinny, nor a fan of the style I was worried I wouldn't find anything that I really liked. Then I found their Kilburn Boot cut jeans. These fit great - low rise, boot cut, and relaxed fit! Yay! Plus the ones I wanted were on sale for 50% off. Absolutely wonderful. \n\nStay classy Abercrombie & Fitch!",1
"I can't even review the actual store or the service of the associates who work there. Who can make it through the wall of whatever that obnoxious fragrance is that rapes your olfactory membrane starting at a 6 store radius?\n\nTheir clothes may be fashionable, but it might be better to shop online to avoid any headaches that stem from that gnarly smell.",0
"Loud House Music, Dark lighting, A moose head - Alaskan style, Fierce - not the fragrance of the weak (I dig it), the best knee length cargo shorts around (I buy a new pair every couple years) - that's what makes this store A-OK+ for me.  I've made several personal as well as gift purchases at this store over the years.  Staff is usually greeting at the front (when folding) otherwise they tend to be off doing their own thing.  I've not had a bad experience.  Just not a lot for me other than what I summarized up top - some people really love the store and the clothes.",1
"Asthma and respiratory sufferers avoid this place like the plague.  It stinks to high heaven of cheap teen cologne.  The merchandise is still over priced and staff is dumber than a box of rocks.  On the plus side, it's a great place for decent men's sweat pants.  Just make sure you don't pay full price.  Also wash the clothes when you get them home,  they will stink like their cologne.",0
"Souper Salad and I have never really bonded.  Sure, we've had a few laughs, but generally by the time we part ways it kinda feels like wasted time.  Not that I haven't been properly filled, but for the price I could have gotten better.  And often healthier.  \n\nYa see, the big secret is that most of this stuff isn't healthy.  Sure some of it is, but it is ALL about control.  And who's ever heard of control in an All you can eat place?  ................Exactly.  And between the bread, pizza, creamy pasta salads and the dessert section with ice cream - didn't you just ruin the whole \""""Healthy lunch of salad\"""" concept?\n\nI remember liking the baked potato bar.  We had good times.  And every once in awhile a those garbanzo beans really hit the spot on the salad.  But several of the times I've gone I feel like the lettuce is wilty or in some other way less than appetizing.  And often other ingredients look similar.  Last time I got a baked potato it was under cooked fairly substantially.  \n\nCan you enjoy a meal there?  Sure.  Would I suggest putting this into the regular rotation?  Most likely no.",0
"Oh @SouperSalad, for nearly $10, you can include a drink in the meal.\n\nI enjoy the food, and the selection. I will probably return from time to time, because it's close, and it's a decent price for the kids, who can have water.\n\nBut really, I don't think the soda should be an additional cost.",0
"Awesome workout clothing section. Even for the cold weather types, they had a fair amount of Columbia & North Face wear. BUT, after asking about a weight bench that was displayed practically on the ceiling, whether it gave a flat recline or a angle, and no one could tell us...HMMMM.. the girl reluctantly acted like shed go get some help when we pressed to see the box, please? maybe? She left and 15 minutes later no one came! Another worker walked past and asked us how he could help, we explained about the bench. He cockily stated that no bench would recline flat...HMMM... my hubby pointed out the option on the ground and said , 'that one does'..the worker chuckled..'okay'. We may have purchased an elliptical too, since my running days post knee surgery may have come to a close, but were so aggravated on how no one knew the product or had the schbang to figure it out for a sale, we left and headed over across PV to Camelback SA. Epic, Fail.",0
"Terrible offering and service.  Few products to choose from.  Was shocked to see the grumpy, rude cashier was also the manager.  Wouldn't return.  Sorry I spent any money there.  Online or alternate store would be worlds better.",0
"I bought the best pair of pants @ New York and Company, but they were made for a Mammoth Supermodel (the were sold of the ones for \""""normal\"""" women). Anywho, I took these pants in to Brother's because my husband said they were good and THEY ARE AMAZING!!! The pants were done in 15 MINUTES and when I looked at the hem, it was the BEST I'VE EVER SEEN!!! THIS PLACE IS WORTH THE MONEY!$!",1
"I needed 2 pairs of pants altered in a hurry so I looked on Yelp for a solid place by my house.  I couldn't be happier with this place.  The service, price and quality I received were excellent.  My pants were ready at the date and time promised and there were no issues.  I am glad to have found a great tailor close by and will definitely be back.",1
"Leaving for a grant in Mexico in 2 days for 1 year, I realized I had forgotten to get all of my work slacks hemmed and tailored! Two tailors in North Phoenix laughed me out of their store for bringing in such a large order with such a ridiculous time constraint. Panicked, I came to Brother's Tailoring at the NorthEast corner of Tatum & Thunderbird. Despite it being a late Friday afternoon, Vicki not only promised to have my order done by the time I left the country - she had it all ready the next day!! Blown away by the quality of service and positive, professional atmosphere at this hidden gem in North Phoenix.",1
Bought custom suit and shirt here for my wedding... Peter took care of me. Very happy with product. Phenomenal service.   I returned and exchanged some products with no problems... Better quality and better prices than their bigger competitions like men's warehouse and Macys.   Trust me I looked everywhere.   Stop in and give them chance,1
"My boyfriend and I both had terrible experiences here. Gus' attitude is - well special. If you can handle it great - otherwise why should anyone have to deal with it. After all aren't we the customers?  The prices are outrageous...\nAND finally - i had 2 dresses that I entrusted to them for adjustments. Let's say - they are both COMPLETELY unusable. Why? well, my butt is nearly exposed on one of the dresses. (not exaggerating). And the other - is terrible.....\n\nI would not recommend them to anyone... very very truly disappointed as I could use a good honest knowledgeable helpful tailor./ seamstress....",0
"getting ready for my friend wedding they seems to be very friendly so i trust them of fitting me a suit!i pick it up after 2 weeks,but when i got home pant hem is short of 1 inch and sleeves is short i told them i want my shirt to show at least a 1/4",0
"This place is legit and Gus is great. A tad eccentric--but great. I went there because I had a Living Social coupon for a custom suit. I upgraded and spent extra but whoa. Totally worth it because I LOVE the finished product! I had no idea there were so many decisions, but I liked that. \n\nMy only (very minor) complaint is it took a little too long for my liking to actually get the suit after picking everything out and getting the measurements. Plan ahead and get there at least a few weeks early if the suit is for a special occasion.",1
"To start, I have seen this shop many times, as I frequent two great restaurants next door.  A few months ago, my fiance and I stopped into the store to get an idea on a suit for me for our up coming wedding.  We first met the son, who was very nice and knowledgeable.  I recently returned to the shop when it was time to finally purchase a suit as our wedding is getting close.  I was helped by Maragita, and sold a nice suit. She initially gave me a good deal, and I felt satisfied with the experience.  LET ME TELL YOU HOW THINGS CHANGED ONCE THEY'VE GOT YOUR MONEY!!!!! The suite was ordered from the manufacturer, and arrived about ten days later. When I went to pick it up, I tried it on for any necessary alterations.  I was quoted an extra $115 to make it fit.  Now I understand all suits need some alterations, but this was major work needed.  I took the suit, to get some comparison quotes to fit it, which were cheaper.  I decided to return to the shop to see if the would work with me in coming to an arrangement since I was not happy with the way the experience was going.  A $200 suit, now was costing me $315, when i was under the impression that any alterations were included.  I expressed my displeasure with Margarita, who became very defensive.  I explained that I felt lead a stray in buying the suit since I tried the pants on in front of her and she knew how much alterations the would need.  I understand that alterations are time consuming and people aren't going to work for free.   I suggested a 50% discount and offered to pay $65, to meet me in the middle.  She did not accept this, and was unwilling to work with me at all in satisfying my displeasure.  She even had the attitude that it was some how my fault for not knowing how these things work.  I informed her that she wasn't really doing much to keep me business, and she stated that she had many happy customers and didn't need my return business.  CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SATISFACTION IS NOT A CONCERN FOR THIS STORE.  MARGARITA HAD NO INTEREST IN TRYING TO WIN MY REPEAT BUSINESS. ONCE THEY HAVE YOUR MONEY, YOU'RE OWN YOUR OWN. I WOULD NOT SUGGEST THIS SHOP TO ANYONE!!!!",0
Amazing service. It doesn't matter if you're rich or poor these guys treat you with such great respect. It's been about a year since I've been in. I love this place. You come out feeling like James Bond. I've done the MW thing and the mall thing like Nordstrom. If you are a grown man you should have yourself a tailor. This is a family run business and they are proud of that. It was so nice to see. If Peter takes care of you. He will take GREAT care of you. I thought me and this guy were the same age he was so professional and mature that I was surprised to find that I was 7 years older. Service was top notch. \nI had so many compliments at a wedding in Cabo San Lucas. One guy from NYC asked who I was wearing and his brother walks up and says screw that. Who is your tailor? haha enough said.,1
"It doesn't cost any extra to be nice....and everyone is always 'nice' when I go in. They also print a nice sign. However, they have NO CLUE how to give outstanding customer service. Another example of how businesses can thrive despite their inadequacies.",0
"I placed an order for 12 signs 3 weeks ago, I still do not have my signs. I went to the store to pickup a sample of the sign ordered 3 weeks ago and had to wait 40 minutes to be acknowledged. At no point in time did anyone greet me or say we will be with you in a minute. \n\nThis is the LAST order I ever give to this company. Lesson learned.",0
"Last month I tried to order a set of signs. Long story short I waited two weeks and many calls later I still never got a proof. Only excuses. Finally I told them to forget it.\n\nLast week I decided to give them a second try and replaced my order. I was told that I would have my proofs the next day. Three days later still no proofs. I called back, still no proofs. 4 days after my I should have had my proofs I called again, They then emailed me the proofs an hour later. The sign was all wrong. I started to make a list of corrections needed but when I reached 5 I gave up and walked away. \n\nI don't have any more time to waste on this company.\nJosh seemed nice but completely in over his head. Angela never seemed particularly pleasant and always seemed inconvenienced by my inquiries.",0
"This the worst sign company in the valley.  I literally waited months for my signs to come in ...all this and they charged my credit card long before I received my signs.  Once the signs came in they were damaged and the whole order was not there.  I was left high and dry for Open House signs after Josh said he would have them for weeks!  I don't know how this con artist sleeps at night!  Josh is the biggest bullshitter out there!  He says he can deliver the moon and delivers nothing.  I really don't know how they stay in business.  I have learned my lesson with these guys.  Take my advice; there are a lot of sign companies out there, DONOT use this company!!!  I wish I had looked on Yelp before I placed my order; I would have never used this company!",0
"Hey trust me when i tell you....you will receive 5 star treatment at this midas on Bell road. Located only about 1 min off SR51 here in phoenix...it is you one stop destination for everything that is ailing your car, truck, van, SUV, or motorcycle. I remember when I first moved out here in Feb..I had some serious issues going on with my 1999 Jeep Cherokee classic. My wife and sister-in-law drove our Jeep from Chicago Illinois, more than 2000 miles, and I have to say it made it all the way with no troubles to speak of. \n\nHowever upon arriving in Arizona, i noticed a few days later that the check engine light was on....and i knew i needed to rectify any problems i was having with the Jeep before i took it for it's emission test out here. Well to make a long story short...being new out here i didn't know who to trust to fix my Trucks....also own a 2004 Chevy Colorado....and i had heard some true horror stories about how car mechanics try to swindle you out of thousands of dollars out here.\n\nSo since i needed an Oil change i decided to go to Midas and at least get that done since they were offering to rotate the tires as well all for only 19.99. While i was there i had them check out the check engine light...and check for anything else that was wrong with the Jeep  again before i took it for the emission test. I have to tell you it was the best decision i have made for my trucks since i arrived here. \n\nBob Ostercamp who is the manager at this location has consistently given my great deals on all my automotive repairs. He is honest, direct, straightforward, and most importantly he cares how your vehicle runs. He has a great staff of certified mechanics and you can trust they will always do the very best job. This location gets a lot of repeat business because of all these factors.\n\nSo if your ever in need for honest, reliable, and great service please visit these guys...i promise you...you won't be sorry. Take Care my friends!!!!!",1
5 star service my butt! I literally saw 3 people come in and just stand in the lobby. No greeting from the owner...nothing! I left. Will never come back or recommend.,0
When times are slow this place will make up for it by exagerating the problems with your vehicle.  Customer beware!  The service you get is not the one you really needed.,0
"When Bob Ostercamp was the manager, this place was the BEST! He had the best mechanics and gave you great service at a discount price. Bob has retired & this place is horrible now. Say they fix things and don't. Don't go, waste of money!",0
"Took my car there on a Saturday because my regular mechanic was closed. While they were able to fix my car fairly quickly, less than a week later the problem reoccurred. Found out that they charged me DOUBLE for what the part they replaced was worth, and they didn't completely remedy the problem. Never coming back, will take to another mechanic down the road for emergencies.",0
"This locale is within walking distance of my apartment complex. The lobby area is nice but I don't go in very much at all. The drive thru is quick and easy.....friendly service.....no hassle ATM'S and considering it is located on the corner of a major thorough fare it is very safe to conduct your outside transactions here. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!",1
"My comment is directed at Bank of America in general. I had been banking with them for 15 years, with substantial lines of credit. Of course when times are good, they are your best friend. \nBut when times are tough, they dump you like a bad case of the flu!\n\nI know noone will care about this review! We all know the banks in general dont give a hoot about their clients. But at least I will feel better.\n\nOf course, that was years ago, and now I am getting back to maklng money - and now I have banks knocking at the door.\n\nBut I will always remember the treatment they gave - cutting credit lines, closing accounts and suspending credit. All the while while the feds bail them out!\n\nSo screw you Bank of America!",0
"We purchased a three diamond anniversary band from this store. The ring was a little bit tight so we left it for sizing. We picked it up and it was wrapped as it was a gift so we didn't check the size. When I opened the package on our anniversary, the ring was huge. I took it to a Jared closer to where we live and they needed to take the size down ONE whole size. I asked what they would do with the extra gold in the band and she said they would melt it back into the ring. When I picked it up, it fit perfectly but to me the band looked thinner. I think they intentionally made the ring too large so I would have to have it sized back down and they would keep the extra gold. Of course, it wasn't that much gold but when you add it with all their other customers, it would be substantial. \n\nThen we took the ring to another jeweler near us to have it appraised. Jared told us it was an S1clarity but this jeweler said it was at best an I1....which is much less. We called Jared but they said that it was sold as presented.",0
"Have had the worse experience ever with this store!! Don't buy from them!! I repeat DON'T BUY FROM THEM!! My fianc\u00e9 ordered a custom made ring for me which when he picked it up it looked like someone who was drunk put it together!! They tried to fix it three times only making it worse!  Which then we decided to go with a whole different ring to be made bc we were so aggravated with the quality. They told us it would be 6 more weeks before the ring would come in! Now when you're engaged and can't even rock your ring that's an issue. But okay let's get what we pay for and wait 6 more weeks. Well... The promise date was one week ago and still no ring! We have been engaged since Aug 24th and its now Oct 20 and still no ring!! This place is a joke!! Beware!!!!!   Update:  second ring has come in and it's still looks like someone who was drunk put this together. Diamonds in halo are jagged and not straight, Center diamond was not put in straight , one of the diamonds down the side of the band sunk in and when my fianc\u00e9 told them that this too was unacceptable and needed to be fixed he was told nothing is perfect and asked if he was an engineer! ( by the manager Chris!)  This place is a nightmare and a joke. 2 rings later and it has yet to be on my finger. Horrible horrible experience from customer service to quality. Update: a THIRD ring has to be made!! Yes a THIRD ring! Apparently the ring came in with mil grain which there wasn't suppose to be mil grain so instead of sending that back they decided to sand the mil grain off which let to uneven surfaces which leads to diamonds don't sit right! Are you kidding me??!!  Oh and the custom made wedding band that we paid a lot of money for came in as well... guess what! it was missing a diamond! yes you read correctly, tgey actually handed us the ring to take with a diamond missing! There is only one positive to this situation and her name is Wendy! Wendy is our sales person who during all of this has been amazing and 100% honest with everything. It's unfortunate she has to work for this store because she deserves better! Other than that they really need to reconsider who is working for this store. And the manager Chris is a major dick head FYI.",0
"Absolutely terrible customer service. The lady I spoke with was ignorant and extremely disrespectful. They are overpriced and lack basic customer service skills. All I wanted was a stone to be set and received flack. If you don't buy from them, they are useless when it comes to fixing, repairing or setting a stone. Save your time, money and energy. Go elsewhere.",0
"Since I wrote that last review, I learned there is a three month period where you can return the ring for store credit. They did not tell me this when I called. \n\nThis store is dishonest. Stay away!",0
"What can I say? \n\nWhen I shop for diamonds, I expect a certain level of service. Jared definitely delivered. This is my fifth time buying from this Jared, and it wont be my last. \n\nGreat service. Great products. Clean store with no B.S.",1
"Had the most positive experience in a government building when I visited to get my social security card. I literally walked in, checked in with the security guard, she gave me my ticket, checked my bag for weapons, and I sat down for literally 4minutes and was called up to a window. \n\nIt was about noon when I visited on a Friday to get my Social Security Card, and the representative was super pleasant and helpful. I strongly suggest if you don't want to deal with parking issues with the downtown location, come here!",1
"2.. the number of hours I spent here getting my new social security card with my new last name. 7. the number of minutes it took, once my name was called to get a new SS card ordered for me in said last name. I pray that I never have to come back to this place again after that crazy experience. Plus it was FREEZING! What the crap?",0
"As other reviews have said if you are looking to change your name Suite B is around the corner from the main entrance so park / walk in on that side. Both entrances have a security guard that will ask why you are there and will ensure that you get checked in. If you have a bag or purse, they will ask to check it for any weapons and then request that you put your cell phone on silent or vibrate.\n\nI didn't have an appointment, but since we recently got married, I needed to request a new SS card in order to get my name updated. I received a ticket from the security guard that checked me in and I was about 4 numbers off from the most recently called one. I waited about five minutes in a chair before my number was called (side note: if you go at lunch time, they will have less windows open - so if you can, try going during the earlier morning, or a bit after lunch to ensure you get seen).  \n\nBe sure to check their website before going so you can print and fill out the application form and have it ready to go.  It's also a great resource for being able to know what to bring with you so you don't have to make a return trip.  \n\nI had my passport, birth certificate, driver's license and marriage license. It took about five minutes for the clerk behind the counter to type in all my information and I was ready to go!  She was fast, efficient and friendly.  The security guard was helpful and funny. \n\nOverall: A\nCheck the website, come prepared, and all in all it should be a quick visit!!",1
Very bad customer service! Look out for the lady ismara behind the counter. She is the wetzel pretzel devil!,0
Was there awhile back. Food was just average. However the reason for my 1star review-   On my way out i ordered a piece of chocolate cream pie to take out.   When I got home I opened the box and inside was a dried up piece of pie.   Literally.  I put my fork into the whipped cream and the entire whipped cream came off in one piece.  Underneath the chocolate was dried and cracked.  It was the consistency  of something that sat for 2 weeks in an arid place.   Im not making this up.  The pie had to have been a couple of weeks old.  What bothered me though was that waitress HAD to have known the pie was old.  The staff HAD to have passed it several times over the weeks.  I was floored.  I threw it out cause it was too late to drive back there.  Da did they think I wouldn't notice!  Will never go back there because that wasn't just a mistake.   They didn't want to loose money so they sold me it to instead. And they are famous for their pies.   What a laugh,0
"Walked in and sat down, waiting to be seated with my wife. The manager, or whoever was seating people, came half way over to us and said, \""""welcome to village inn. How many in your party?\""""\n\nI'm sure this is what he's supposed to say but he said it extremely rudely and without a smile. When I told him we had two and wanted a booth, he dismissively and, with a tinge of anger, said he'd have to wipe a booth down first. I told my wife, \""""let's go,\"""" and we went to paradise valley burger across the street. I'm so tired of crappy customer service. If you get a customer service job, smile and be kind to your customers. It's literally THAT EASY. \n\nP.s. The two stars are for how the food usually is... I actually kinda like the V.I.B :)",0
"Let me start off by saying that I love Village Inn; I have always have and I probably always will. But this is the first time I've received horrible service. \n\nI called to put in a to-go order and at first the girl who answered was nice. But she put me on hold 3 times while I was trying to place my order so I had to keep repeating it. Then she hung up on me. I called again and this time a guy answered, I told him what happened, and he apologized for it and took my order. I ordered a Turkey Bacon Avocado Melt with no red onions. I should have checked the order when I picked it up but I didn't, so now I know in the future to do that. When I get home my sandwich has no avocado, no tomato, but it has red onions. I get that people make mistakes but this is a pretty big mess up. I called to complain and the girl who answered said \""""Oh, I'm sorry. Can I put you on hold?\"""" No, you can't. \n\nDefinitely won't be going back to this location.",0
"What in the heck happened to the portion sizes at IHOP? Back in the day, I used to walk out of this place with a full belly, ready to collapse on the couch. This time, I found myself picking off my son's plate! My husband's omelette was smaller than my son's that we ordered off the kids menu! Weird... just weird. I don't think we'll be coming back. I'll stick with the Good Egg.",0
"We stopped by after a unexpected dental procedure for my wife as she wanted something soft to eat and pancakes filled the bill.  The food was O.K. but our server seemed more interested in us getting leaving.  She took our order and delievered our food with no problem, then she presented us with our check without even asking if we wanted anything more.  I was thinking about some desert, but with the \""""hurry up and leave\"""" attitude, I wasn't going to bother her.  The sad thing is, they were not busy and I would have thought that she'd been upselling everything so that she could increase her tip.",0
"I've eaten at this location several times but I don't think I will be back.\nThe food & the service is always good but the portions seem to be getting smaller each time. I always order the same thing, Pancake combo, 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, 2 slices of bacon & hash browns. \nThe past 2 times I've eaten here, I've left still feeling hungry after eating all that. I don't even think there was a 1/2 cup of hasbrowns & the bacon slices are so thin.\nI think I will just go a little out of my way & eat at The Good Egg where you get realistic size portions, 4 slices of thick cut, meaty bacon for the same price and I NEVER leave hungry. Sorry IHOP you've disappointed me one too many times.",0
Don't go here for lunch. It's gross and everything is microwaved. The corn was not fresh and the gravy for the potatoes was like white turd. The service on the other hand flat out sucked. She came twice to fill up my water. I was waiting for about 15 minutes for the check. She said I'm sorry I'm kinda busy. There was 6 people in IHOP! That was just pure laziness. I've gone for breakfast multiple times and it was fine. This time it wasn't very good. Why can't they cook their food instead of microwaving everything? Is it that hard to cook something? I won't be back for lunch. Id rather go to a soup kitchen and ill probably get better food and service there.,0
"We go to this IHOP on occassion an it has always been fairly good.\nWe had an Anniversary Coupon, and Lupe was our server. She was nice and friendly.\nFood was good.\n\nPS, not very happy they don't seem to have the NY cheesecake pancakes anymore. Hubby was unhappy, Daughter was devastated...",1

"Ordered here today, BIG mistake but won't happen again!! I called ahead to order food for take out. I was put on hold and stayed there until I arrived at the restaurant (10+ mins). When I walked in STILL on hold and shared that info with them, they could've cared less! No apology, no nothing!! I was very surprised by that. They clearly aren't concerned with customer service whatsoever given their reviews everywhere online. I checked my food when I got to my car and they barely gave me any topping for my blueberry pancakes and clearly didn't understand what \""""extra butter and syrup\"""" meant! If I wanted to deal with them I would've gone back in but I was SO over them by then! If I hadn't been set on their pancakes today I would've gone to 5 N Diner or Denny's!!

"I came here tonight at 10 pm, and the resteraunt was full of a bunch of panzy, animal like, horizon high school kids. Now I know that sounds mean, but they were literally standing up and yelling, throwing things, screaming across the reateraunt....and not being polite or respectful to other quests. The thing that bothered me the most is that I told multiple waiters to get a manager to ask them to act like humans, and that never happend!!! The food was good, and our waitress was sweet...but management needs some help, if they are allowing this behavior. I was informed by multiple employees that these kids come every Friday night so I would avoid this location!!! I Won't Come Back, I Don't Have Enough BOTTLES Of advil To Handle That, nor do I Have the patience.",0
"A buddy had been recommending this place for a while and after getting a ridiculous diagnosis and quote from Airpark Jeep, I called Dave to get his thoughts.  He is an extremely knowledgeable, down to earth and a genuinely nice guy.  He went over all the things that the dealership told me I needed and broke them down into things I needed to do, things I should think about doing, and things that were completely unnecessary.  His prices were half of what the dealership would have charged and I have so much more confidence in the repairs as well.\n\nIn a world where it is hard to find someone that is not out to get you for as much as they can, it is refreshing to deal with an honest company that is really looking out for your best interests.  I can't recommend Dave and Advanced Autoworks enough.",1
Dave is hands down the most honest and hard working mechanic/shop owner you can find.  Always straightforward and always finishes in a timely manner. Have been taking my vehicles here for years and would never go that elsewhere.,1
I have been going to Advanced for years and Dave has been great to work with. I like that he gives you the options to use factory parts or to use aftermarket based on your budget. Plus the work has already been completed on time and for what was quoted. I would highly recommend Advanced for any car repairs you need.,1
"When a product has a 100% satisfaction guarantee listed, and your daughter paid $24.00 for .7 oz (20 g) you shouldn't feel guilty when the product is damaged and you return it for an even exchange. I rec'd Pure Abundance powder as a gift (at Christmas), it was a solid lump of goo when it should be powder. I was told by the employee it could still be used. Really?! No, this product you sprinkle on your hair, not try to spread a blob of goo!  They reluctantly exchanged it, but the one gal looked at me as though I had purposely damaged the product or was pulling a fast one. I gave them two stars, ONLY because they did exchange the product -- I guess that is what the 100% satisfaction guarantee means, but usually without the attitude.  \n\nI will not purchase anything from this Paradise Valley mall Aveda site - the Aveda shop in Tempe is much nicer \""""Mood Swings\"""" I recommend you go there for your Aveda needs. \n\nNot happy in Scottsdale.\nCindy",0

"On 8/23, I went to the Aveda store in PV Mall to pick out my Pure Privilege birthday gift.  Since the store was busy, I went to the makeup to see if anything interested me.  After a few minutes, an associate asked if I needed any help picking out colors.  I smiled and waved the certificate in my hand and said, \""""nope - I'm here to pick out my birthday gift today!\""""  I was excited to pick out a new fragrance since the patchouli blend I've always worn was discontinued.   I've gone through the experience at least five or six times, so I was looking forward to sitting down and going through the options.  \n\nThe associate said, \""""Oh, well, you also have your double points certificate\"""" and proceeded to their back room to put her drink cup away.  I continued looking at makeup.  She came back, walked to the registers and says to the customer being rung up, \""""I haven't seen you in so long!\"""" and then chats for a moment before walking over to the table where she started pulling out the oil blends.  She didn't say a word to me.  I looked over after a minute and she had a few of the bottles uncapped and lined up.  I put down the makeup and started to walk towards the table.  She still hadn't said anything to me about how we were going to walk through the experience, if she was ready for me, what I should be doing...nothing.  So I stood about four feet away from the table waiting for her to acknowledge me.  At this point she gestured at the stool and said, \""""You can sit down.\""""  So I did, and then I waited because she was still uncapping bottles and setting them in a row.  When I didn't reach for any of the bottles, she looked at me and said in a snide tone, \""""You can start anytime.\""""  I was floored.  First, that she spoke to me in that tone and second because I know this isn't how Aveda does things.  Going into an Aveda store is always a treat.  You're greeted.  You're offered tea.  The associates talk to you and suggestively sell and offer you a moment of wellness.  You almost forget how much money you're spending on product because they make it an experience.\n\nIn that moment, I was so shocked that I actually just did what she told me and started sniffing the bottles.  I eliminated a few, but I still had four in front of me, and I said, \""""Hmm, I can't choose between these four,\"""" thinking that she would ask questions to help me narrow down a choice.  I got silence.  By this point, I am not only disappointed because I'm not being \""""pampered\"""" (which to me is more fun than the actual free product), but I'm being given the silent treatment.  There is no conversation, no \""""so what are you doing for your birthday,\"""" no acknowledgement that I'm in there for a special treat, no acknowledgement that I'm a Pure Privilege member, nothing.  Just an associate standing next to me, alternately watching me smelling bottles and staring into space.  I assume she had better things to do than to take care of me.  \n\nI went on to ask about the notes in the other bottles, and then because I was so awkwardly uncomfortable with the whole situation between the silence and the staring, I just picked one and said, \""""This is the one I'd like.\""""\n\nShe flipped the bottle onto the base and let it drain.  In complete silence.  When it was done, she hurriedly stuffed it into the envelope, handed me the envelope, and chirped, \""""There you go!\""""  She hadn't even bothered to mark the envelope with my choice.  So as she turns away from me and starts putting the bottles back, I walk over to the counter to ask to borrow a pen.  She finally gestures at me so that I cannot pretend not to see her and says to me with an exaggerated fake smile on her face (she didn't smile at me the entire time she was \""""helping\"""" me), \""""Can I help you with something?\""""  I said, \""""I would like to borrow a pen, please, because you didn't mark down which blend I chose.\""""  She replies in a syrupy, cheerfully fake voice, \""""Oh here, let me do that for you\"""" and takes the envelope from me.  She hands it back and says, \""""Can I offer you a moment of wellness?\""""  I lost it.  I said, \""""No, you can't.  You should have done that from the beginning.  You have completely ruined my birthday treat AND my afternoon.\""""  And I proceeded to be something I have never been in a retail store before - an incredibly angry customer.\n\nI have gotten bad and nonexistent service in lots of places, but none that ever made me feel this way or provoked this kind of reaction from me.  I did not get the woman's name, but she had dark brown, wavy, shoulder-length hair and glasses. The team at the Fashion Sq. store have always been fabulous.  I will never go to PV again.",0
"I thought this Fry's closed a little later on a Friday night - either 11pm or midnight.\n\nNope. 10pm. I got there, knowing what I wanted and needed. My friend also got what she wanted as well...no announcements that the store was closing. My friend and I were at the self-checkout...for the record, I hate those things because I feel like they're taking away from the workforce, but that's just me, though.\n\nAnyway, the lone cashier that was open looked like she had a huge line, so I opted to use the self-checkout.\n\nI got my stuff and my friend started to ring up her purchases...*machine stops working*\n\n\""""Oh, were you going to buy that? I thought you were both done. I turned off the registers.\"""" and continued to make a fuss about what a pain it was to turn them back on. Really? Turn the key to the right. That's all she has to do...unless she needs to call in a manager or something. I don't know about their procedures to re-open registers.\n\nI kept thinking, \""""No, she's just going to walk out with it.\""""\n\nInstead my friend said, \""""Well, since it's clearly so much hassle for you to turn the registers on, then I'll take my business elsewhere. There are other stores that are open.\""""\n\n\""""Oh no, it's not that...let me turn on the registers again.\"""" \n\nSomehow she made it sound like she was doing us the favor...and she turned a key and entered in a code and VOILA! the register was open again...all that attitude from the person monitoring the self-checkout just to have her turn a key and enter a code? Lame.\n\nAt the end, when she realized that it wasn't a $2.00 purchase, she was all smiles.\n\nLong story short: go before closing, preferably before the sun sets because it's a little scary...and the parking lot is a little on the dirty side, as was the rest of the store. I saw where some people had munched on donuts, then tossed them into a shelf, hiding it behind some items, hoping it wouldn't be spotted. GROSS.",0

Great store and always so friendly. The selection is great and we have not had a bad experience in all the years we have gone there. My only wish is they would have more of a selection of organic and grass fed products so I would have one stop shopping.,1
"We had to change rooms on the first night. Huge roach on top of the Microwave. The second room was so dusty. I had a miserable night. When we addressed our issues to Sandra at the front desk ; she told me that I needed to reserve a non-allergic room. Translations: Rooms they actually dust and clean. I was sneezing all night. I don't have this problem under typical conditions. The first room also had trash and hair clips left behind from the previous patrons. Sandra did not offer a solution or seemed too concern. Later that night I voiced a concern to a man at the desk and he offered an additional night. That was kind of him, though the problem was I couldn't breath and was sneezing.. Needless, to say we didn't take the offer. Before I forget to mention, one of the sofa chairs upholstery was torn. I do have pics to back up my claims. After our second room was re-cleaned we had to dust our selves. The last night I couldn't sleep because I'm certain I felt bed bugs. I googled them from my phone. After seeing the huge cock roach I was to scared to check for the bed bugs in the mattress as advised from the website. Which brings me to, their wi-fi. You have to pay for it. Pretty, chinsey to charge for wi-fi. (about $14.95/day) However some of the down stairs desk computers face the windows entering the Hotel. They use their wifi for staying on Facebook all day. There wasn't one time as I was entering & leaving for the day that I did not see an Embassy Suite's staff Face Book page up. lol I guess the wifi is for their staff. \nOther then the rooms the overall stay was o.k. Restaurant service was very kind and friendly. They have a nice serve to order breakfast bar. Manager's reception at night with snacks and drinks. The view from our suite was beautiful over looking the pool and golf course. They need to work on the cleanliness of their rooms, especially since that's what they pride them selves on.. Firing Sandra would be a good move.",0
"Stayed at this Hotel for a few days and well there are some thins that need work but the good out weighs the bad.\n\non that note lets go with the bad.\nthe only thing i noticed was bad was the organization down at the front desk, they clearly had our rooms mixed up and it was just a mess... but i guess that was to be expected because there was a bunch of us, so i guess that was ok.\n\nstarting off with the room, very clean and there was a great view of the on site golf course. Adequate lighting, LCD TV, Couch and separate bedroom. \n\nInternet WiFi for a price of about $14 per night.\n\nChow Hall down stairs to the right when you walk into the entrance of the hotel.\nThe food was ok, regular cafeteria food to me and i actually have no problem with that. \n\nOn site workout room that consist of a full dumbbell rack, medicine balls, a few cardio machines and TV's.\n\nOnsite Golf course..... i dont play golf so.... i cant review it... i can only say that its there haha",1

Worse KFC ever!!! Drive through takes forever they only do one car at a time a each car takes about 5-6 minutes. Service is horrible. The inside is filthy. And there phone is disconnected so you can call to complain. \n\nToday they have someone who has a very strong accent over a horrible speaker so you can't understand anything she says. \n\nDon't waste your time as it will take a lot of it if you do.,0
"Not too sure of their menu in the drive thru, we decided on a 4 piece meal with 2 sides\nfor my friend and I.  $7.49 plus $1 extra for one being a breast comes out to about $10 total.  I get the stuff, get home and ready for our meal, and there is 2 pieces of chicken.  I called the store.  \n\nThey kid told me they asked the girl that packed it --- and she said she packed it right.  (Uh...no, cause we're looking at 2 pieces of chicken)...\n\nI disputed that as did my friend next to me, and he said there was nothing they could do for me.  I asked him to credit my card so as not to drive back 6 miles for 2 pieces of chicken, he said he wouldn't.  \n\nHe would have the manager call me next day.  Manager doesn't call me and basically KFC just screws you--without remorse.  My suggestion is check your order if you go there, it's probably not right, and they won't care if it's not.\n\nValue...BAD...I could have bought 2 roasted chickens for the price, and I didn't like being treated at 61, like I'm out to \""""take\"""" KFC for 2 pieces of chicken that I didn't already pay for.\n\nIn my business if a customer complained they were shorted, I made it right, right away...it's not worth the bad will to turn away a customer.\n\nSo the morale....Count your chickens from KFC...they don't.",0

"I went to a late lunch here today.  Great food and great carhops!  A reasonable value and quick service.  Unfortunately, it all comes with a large helping of rudeness from the person taking the orders.  You never see the person who takes your order which is a major weakness in their system.   Today that anonymity was taken advantage of by someone who decided to be abrasive and condenscending  So if you are really hungry and want a side order of crappy attitude and abuse with your lunch, this is the place for you. Personally, I'm going to give it some time because no business can succeed with an employee acting like this.",0
"Visited this Sonic fast food estsblishment last night as the little one wanted a corn dog. Drove through and ordered some selections to take home.

Little one then started pealing the breading off the corn dog (which he likes to eat last) revealing a very blackened skinney little Weiner about the size of my pointing finger. Cant believe they would serve this burnt shriveled half sized  wenie to anyone. Sonic should be deeply ashamed. I also had some popcorn chicken that was overbreaded and tasteless. Ugh.!

Now I remember why I stopped coming here.  It takes FOREVER to get your food.  I realize it's a small kitchen with one guy back there but for 3 orders (2 ahead of me) it shouldn't take 25 mins.  Foods decent but I'll head to Frederico's on Cave Creek any day over this place.,0

"I took my car to Cobblestone for an oil change and car wash combo because I had a coupon to save a couple bucks.\r\n\r\nThe moment I pulled up to the service center the employees started to try to pressure me into additional (expensive) add-ons.

Horrible service and it took forever!!! Never going to use them again. I tried to like them because they were close to my house but now I will drive further to go to Danny's.,0
"My husband and I went here to get the car washed before we headed to some nearby dealers to try to trade it in. As many people have already said, the nonstop sales pitches from the moment we pulled in were really rather irritating. After iterating several times that we were not interested in getting the car detailed or waxed, the sales guy returned at least 3 more times to our vehicle saying that his boss had \""""authorized\"""" him to lower the price \""""once again.\"""" We didn't give in to his pressure, but it felt very frustrating to have to assert ourselves so many times. The wash itself was satisfactory, but as Jake mentions in his review, the \""""hassling\"""" and sales pitches made me not want to go back.",0
"I stopped using their services in March 2007 because everytime I went there, they would give me grief over the slightest dings on my windshield just to upsell and high-pressure me to get it fixed when it didn't need fixing.  After I stopped going there, they started pressuring me at home by calling me several times, despite the fact that I told them several times not to call me anymore.  I called the Phoenix Police and they suggested that I contact my phone company and it turned out that I had a feature to block specific phone numbers from calling me.  I blocked them and haven't heard from them since.",0
Car wash poor. Left waterspots all over. Lazy employees.  Refused to clean rims properly after being told it would not be a problem.  When spoke with manager he stood behind his lazy employees.  1 star is being generous. I immediately threw away wash card I had signed up for. Not this or any other cobblestone carwash will ever see any of my vehicles again.,0
"The customers service could be better in the store.....but the guys who take care of my trucks on the outside are great. I bought the Groupon deal to receive 3 months of unlimited express car washes for 20 bucks....there is not a better deal in the state of Arizona....maybe even the nation....LOL. The guys here get my trucks squeaky clean....and I am out in 5 minutes or less and that includes hand drying it. I will be enjoying this great deal until late October.....but even without the deal the wash is only 4.99 which is very cheap for what you get. So if you need to get your car or truck clean in this Arizona desert....head over to Cobblestone....and remember to Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!",1
"What a poor initial visit!  Car was washed quick, but they left car in finishing area for 15 minutes before I gave up and took the unfinished car.  No apologizes and I was not alone, many others frustrated standing around.  Poor staffing!  Would not go back.",0
"Wow what a sloppy car wash.  I got the ultimate because I said I wanted everything done.  Of course I was offered great detailing prices, but passed on that.  The Ultimate honestly isn't worth the $25.  My truck wasn't dry, there still was dirt and bird droppings, and the indoor/outdoor dressing was slopped on.  I have large spots of dressing that wasn't spread evenly and spots with none.  The edges on the windows, mirror, and well any edge is missed completely.  I felt like I should have saved my money, driven thru a cheap car wash and finished it myself.  The only reason I gave it a second star is the stellar pricing and work the window guys did on my multiple chips.\n\nI will not be back to this place.  Not worth the price.  I have had better done cheaper.",0
"All car wash spots love to up sell . . . and we got the chip in the window one yesterday, but I have to say, they didn't high pressure sell us. They gave us information we didn't know, and we ended up using their service for the windshield not just for the car we brought in, but also the one at home! We were totally amazed at how great my husband's windshield looked after they cleaned and filled a nasty chip. \n\nThe wash was great as well.  No streaks, no water drops left behind . . . We bought a package of four top of the line washes from an on-line discounter. Not knowing what to expect of the quality of work, I shuddered when my husband bought multiples, but we were very pleased with the wash both inside and out.\n\nThe service people were so polite, from Sean who handled our windshields, to Jason, the manager, who checked out the small details before handing my husband the keys.\n\nI actually don't think the up sells are so high pressure . . . dine out and servers always push appetizers, drinks, desserts . . . this isn't any different.",1
"I used to like coming to this car wash because it was the only one near me. Now, their car wash prices are a lot higher for lousy cleaning. Also, when you first pull up to select your car wash, I feel as if I'm at a used car sales lot. The employees are incredibly pushy to upsell you on a simple car wash. I can't say I will be returning anytime soon.",0
"Wish I'd read these reviews before I went there, but I was getting my phone fixed down the street, and decided a quick car wash would help kill the time. The previous reviewers are right on the money when it comes to the ol' up-sell. You would think with all these reviews saying the same thing it would be looked into, and trust me, I understand the value of a good up-sell...but THREE times with THREE separate people? It's a little much. Plus, if I come in there initially inquiring over the $4.99 price and asking if there is anything lower than the $32 price (which to be fair, yes, there is) what in the world makes you think I am going to want to spend upwards of 60 dollars? Honestly. And it shouldn't take me 10 minutes to convey to you that I really am not concerned with my windshield right now...that's right, I'm gonna take a gamble on that one, I live on the edge like that....\n\nYou did do a pretty good job cleaning the car, but leaving a car wash of all places feeling frazzled is not my thing. Not to mention, I fell for the $4 \""""Supreme Upgrade\"""" and you forgot my vanilla air freshener. Dang it. Had no idea what kind of negotiation would occur if I went back, so I will look at it as a lesson learned and go on with my life....:)",0
"They put packing tape on my brand new car! It doesn't have pieces blowing in the wind, so the tape was unnecessary and left adhesive on the paint around the back wiper and the tire cover. To add insult to injury, it took nearly half an hour even though there was no line, and the employees let the car dry completely before they pretended to wipe it off, so there were water spots everywhere. They also didn't even attempt to wipe off the adhesive from the tape. It seems reasonable to expect that your car will be cleaner after a car wash than before, but not at this place.",0
"May want to watch your credit card charges made to this place.. Had a car wash a few days ago.. Credit card charge got posted twice on my credit card statement..\n\n1/31/13 - Issue resolved by Cobblestone, RyanC thank you for your efforts!",1
"To begin with, the only reason this place gets 2 stars is because it has Dunkin Donuts that my children like to eat before I allow them to play in the (usually dirty) play area. \nI took my car there today thinking the bad service I received last time was just a bad day for everyone. I wish I had not given them a second chance. I went because I wanted an oil change and car wash. No, I don't want my transmission fluid flushed. No, I don't want my coolant system flushed. No, I do not want you to replacement my windshield wipers. No, I do not want you to rotate my tires. No, I do not like Green Eggs and Ham. I find it extremely frustrating to have someone try to up-sell me on a constant basis, even when you were suppose to start work on my truck 20 minutes prior. I don't appreciate being mocked when I say that the extra $80 you want to charge me today is not in my budget. I do not appreciate having my window broken because they accidentally knocked it off track because the idiots locked my keys in the car... twice. Their cashiers are bitchy and all their stuff is over priced.\nSave your self the hassle, don't use Cobblestone.",0
"The car wash is good but man I tell you everytime I've been to this place the high pressure up selling is totally annoying.  You mean I can't even get a car wash without up selling pressure?  Man, I no longer go there.  Danny's is less pressure.",0
"Yup, an update so soon. At this point, I don't know who has trained who. It seems like they don't try to sell upgrades as hard to me which I like and after coming here for years I know how clean my car will be. \n\nThis time, I actually cleaned the interior of the car myself before coming to get it washed. What little that still needed to be vacuumed, I told the guy and yup, sure enough, when I picked up the car, the area that needed to be vacuumed . . . still needed to be vacuumed. Lol. \n\nAnd I still come here to get my car washed. What can I write- I think at this point I think Cobblestone is like a comfy pair of shoes to me. Lol.",1
"I don't even want to give it one star, they are a big rip off! They used to be good, now they no longer care about customer service.. Just how much can they make while you are there...",0
"If you want to throw your money away go to this carwash. I paid $35.00 for Ultimate plus. When I went to pick up my car, the interior was dirty. There were cig ashes on the seat, dashboard had dust on it, mats were not vacuumed. Mind you I don't smoke. When I brought it to the Managers attention he told me that their packages don't cover vacuuming inside the car. The guy who sold me this package when I got there promised me the dashboard, doors and seats will be polished. Nothing was polished. Manager said the guy lied and they don't do it. Left with a dirty car even after paying $35.00",0
Great service from Ahmod at the counter it's really nice to find great customer service this day and age. Nice job cobblestone team! Especially Ahmod!,1
"I have to give this place 5 stars!!! I went today to get my oil changed after work around 430.  I had never been to this location and I left happy.  I pulled up and the young guy working was so helpful and kind.  They took my car and were done in 5-10 minutes.  I literally went inside to pay (20 dollars by the way) cheapest oil change I have paid.  I walked inside to the cashier, where there is a kids playground inside(who knew) The two people working were smiling and seemed to be super happy (even if they were working on a Saturday)  The man gave me a receipt and said now that you have this you can come in next time and get a free car wash and also today you get free popcorn.  I laughed and was surprised by the popcorn machine near the entrance (fresh popcorn).  I left after spending twenty bucks with popcorn, a free car wash and an oil change under 10 minutes.  I will be back :)",1
"Was waiting for my vehicle in the outside seating area.   A man rode up on a bicycle and sat in the seats and lit up a cigarette. ... in the common area. He wasn't even there to get a car washed.   I went inside to ask if that was allowed, being where everyone was sitting.   I was told,  \""""no, he shouldn't be smoking in that area\"""".  I asked if anyone was going to something to him. .. And as told \""""probably not\"""". Wow. You just lost my business.",0
"Great chili relleno! Pork taco on the dry side. I rarely, if ever eat rice and retried beans, but I must say they were both very good at Los Alomos.  I would love to try the breakfast burrito next time, hard to find good ones in this area.",1
Los Alamos is CLOSED for good.,0
"Stopped in last night because it was close to my son's soccer practice. Very pleasantly surprised. Great service, clean atmosphere, and homemade food. The chips and sals were fresh and delicious as a starter. My wife and I had the Carne Asada plate and the Carne Asada Chimichanga and both were very solid and tasty. I would recommend this great hole in the wall to anyone looking for good Mexican food for a great value. All of the above for less than $20 out the door. Buen Provecho Amigos!!!",1
"Super delicious burritos! I had a bean burrito with guacamole, and my husband had the pollo asada burrito with guacamole. The guacamole was FRESH, and we both devoured our food. It was definitely one of the best we have had since moving from California. Also, the owner who works the front is helpful and very nice. We will be going back to try the chile relleno and enchiladas. Check out the specials when you go in because they change, and are often a really great deal.",1
I really want to try this place based on all the reviews and pictures. \n\nUnfortunately there is a sign on the window that says they are closed due to family emergency and will reopen January 25th. \n\nStill not open and it's March.\n\nI wish the best for their family and hope they get back to making delicious food soon. I'll update this review once they open back up. This is informational only.,0
This restaurant is now closed.,0
"Still closed, phone not in service.",0
Tried to go here but it is permanently closed...Thanks for the updated info Yelp!  Drove out there and thankfully found Lenero!,0
"I know I sound square...but I can't stand this store.When it first came around I liked going in and looking at all the original stuff they had compared to most stores in the mall, but now not so much. Every time I go in there these days I feel first off claustrophobic, then I feel weird because my hair is not dyed black or some other not natural color, and then I think I don't want a shirt with some 80's character on it! Most of all I just find emo/goth types who are always running ramped in there to be overwhelming. I feel more fake shopping in there, than where I usually do.",0
"I was sitting outside of Macy's and decided to walk over to this store. I figured it was more of a kids store, mostly for boys.  Whoa!  It was a few days before Halloween, and it looked like a Fredrick's of Hollywood wanna be. \n\nHalloween aside -- this place came off as a low class and raunchy.  Was that really the intent of your business plan?  Did you feel you executed it well?  Who is your market demo anyway?  I mean really?  Ugh!",0
"Classic big city barber shop!  I won't go anywhere else.  $19 for a decent hair cut, neck shave, hot towel and great Barber's!  Each one with a good story to tell.  Where else can you watch a \""""man show\"""" on a flat screen while getting your hair cut!",1
"I've been going to Classic Barbers since 2003, now with over 40 visits documented in my home accounting program.  Like others, I've been served by all of their barbers and have been fully satisfied with their services.  However, I am not going back.  They've instituted a new policy by charging extra for payment by credit card .  I'm sure they have their reasons.  I hope their reasons outweight the downside of losing loyal customers.",0
This is a great barber shop where I never have to wait long to get a haircut and everyone on the staff gives a great cut.  Hard to find these days.,1
Best barber shop in the valley.,1
In the valley of the sun finding a traditional barber who takes pride in their work is hard to find.  Today it seems that it's trial and error when trying to find a barber who has that attention to detail that's also up on the latest styles.  This place is amazing!!!  It's so great that I drive forty five minutes out of the way because I know I will always get what I ask for here.  I tried a couple other barbers in the valley but this place has the best staff.  It has the old school feel where a man can go shoot the **** and leave with a great cut.  Make sure to take the pomade or other hair product out of your hair before you come in.  It will make a difference and they will appreciate it.   Ask for Michael he is the second chair after you walk through the door.\n\nThe only drawback is that there is a charge to use your credit/debit card.  So plan ahead and bring cash.,1
Just stopped in Classic Barber Shop based on Yelp reviews. First off open on Sunday is a plus. Secondly the establishment was very clean. Got in without a wait and received my cut from Edward. Excellent cut. As if he had been my barber for years. Will definitely recommend and be a loyal customer as long as I live in this area.,1
"What a great place!  Edward is amazing and fantastic with kids!  Hot towel, massage, and a great haircut! Let me tell you my 5 yr old was so happy!  Very professional and modern!  Highly recommend for men!  Getting my husband in for a clean shave!",1
Nice shop I would recommend stopping by. I been twice. 5 stars,1
"So, I just moved in the area and was looking for a new place to get my hair cut. I gave this place a call and politely introduced myself and asked the woman on the phone whether they did only appointments or walk-ins today. She interrupted me mid-question and answered in a tone acting as if I was some kind of annoying pest. I ignore it and ask their approximate wait time and she laughs at me, says \""""ugh.. just come in!\"""" *click* Yes, she hung up on me. The phone call lasted all of 20 seconds.\n\nI immediately called a different barber shop and took my business to somewhere else. As a suggestion to whoever manages this place, please train the bitter, angry woman who answers your phone to have some basic courtesy because you just lost a potential twice-a-month loyal customer.",0
"Just had a fantastic haircut with Yafa! She was very friendly but not overboard like many can be. Did a perfect cut and shave and also a hot towel with massage was unexpected! Only $21 for a perfect cut, I'll be back every time.",1
I actually got a good haircut but the customer service was really bad. You've been warned.,0
"Just moved back to Phoenix and decided to check this place out. Peter cut my hair and did an excellent job. I also got a neck shave followed by a surprise neck and head massage. Total came out to $21 bucks, which I thought was a great deal. I'll be back to see Peter again.",1
"Only thing I can say is that the \""""Open\"""" sign was on in the window and the lights were on in the store, but the door was locked and no staff to be found at 11am on a Tuesday. We waited for about 10 minutes and then left.",0
"DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM!!! \n\nIf something is wrong with your mattress they do not use your \""""warranty\"""" that you supposivly have of 10 years. They make up bullshit so they don't have to give you a new mattress. Collin is full of shit. Had a mattress from them for a year and the middle caved in and they said they can repair it but I will have to pay for it. Don't waste your money on this shitty company.",0
"Went in to get my Optima battery checked on my (new to me) auto.  Tech told me the battery was bad.  Tech no longer recommends Optima but that the house brand is better.  I passed and went over to Auto Zone across the street.  \nAuto Zone tech told me that the battery was good, was less than 2 years old and only needed a recharge.  In conclusion...Batteries Plus will rip off your grandma.  Beware of the bait and switch.",0
Called this store Sunday after my car would not start.  I talked to a salesperson named Josh.  I told him I was having car trouble and wanted to buy a battery for my car as well as have them install it.  He would not sell me a battery or promise that they could do any install on Sunday as there were only 2 people working that day. With service departments closed I stressed that I really needed their help and could not afford to be stranded.  Josh refused to help me and insisted that I take it to a dealership for service as my battery was probably under warranty. I stressed because it was a Sunday I did not care about a warranty.   I just wanted to buy and have a new battery installed.  This salesperson refused to help me.  Having owned my own business for many years I thought the owner of this location would like to know that they lost a sale due to the  lack of initiative and willingness to help by this staff member.,0
"They do have just about any kind or type of battery. My issue is with the website. After looking up the battery you need, then you select the store nearest you and check stock. Then you arrive there to purchase the battery and they tell you they DO NOT HONOR THE INTERNET PRICES. When the internet site directs you to a store they should honor the price.",0
"terrible experience! the only reason i give it 2 stars is because the doctor was very nice and a few of the nurses did a great job. unfortunately, the receptionists ruined it all--between the apparent disdain for their customers and the repeated billing errors I cannot stand this place. During my first visit, I saw one of the receptionist argue with a senior in front of the waiting room about his appointment time which was so unprofessional. Then they (twice) tried telling me I owed $200+ dollars for contacts which are covered and after making me wait for 30 minutes, the girl simply asks for my credit card instead of apologizing for her error. A few days later I get a bill in the mail for $75 for a routine lens fitting which I already paid the copay for! The insurance rep that helped me resolve this expressed her frustration to me as well after she apparently spoke to the same stubborn woman. needless to say, I will not be going back and have already steered a few people away from going to this place.",0
"Be aware, be very aware of this office's practices.  Be sure to bring two wallets with you, one for paying up front and then another for when they bill you for \""""surprise\"""" procedures despite the fact that everything, catch that, everything was included up front.  Second, you are lucky if you see (pun intended) the doctor for more than 30 seconds.  Everything in this eye/cataract factory is handled by clerks and techs in training.  I went to another cataract surgeon's office for my other eye and the billing was complete with no surprises and IT WAS LESS.  The doctor was supportive and communicated at length.",0
"Avoid at all costs. If you go there for an eye exam they will robocall you every day a year later reminding you for an eye exam. Also, I was given a prescription that was way too strong. I had to throw my new expensive glasses away. I ended up going to Q Vision for LASIK. Couldn't be happier. Go here and expect a robocall every day at 5:05.",0
"The respect from the workers there was flat garbage. I got a text saying you can get a buy one get one free smoothie. I go in there and ask them about the buy one get one free and the cashier denies it exists. I have the text and it came from Jamba Juice. He had NO respect towards me. Later, he completely ignored me. I used to come to this Jamba Juice a lot and now I'm not. If they get nicer staff that have better attitudes then I will consider coming back. But until then i will never come back. If I can give this place a negative 10,000,000 stars I would. Customers would be happier if Jamba Juice on Thunderbird Road got new staff. This is pitiful!!!!",0
"Love this Jamba Juice.  The bo-go coupons come through so often that it makes it tough to go there without one.  I have to modify my order to make it dairy.  Pet peeve- it's \""""sherbet\"""", not \""""sher-beRt\"""".  There is no second \""""r\"""".  If you're in the smoothie biz, please say it right.",1
Yesterday evening I went thru the Drive Up window and experienced the most rude behavior from a female employee...I will not frequent that place ever again,0
"Not a good value.  For about the same money as my medium sized mint oreo blizzard, I can get a scoop of real mint ice cream at Sweet Republic with cookies mixed in.  And it will be top quality, too.  Unlike the blizzard I got that was mostly melted yet still wasn't mixed well, so it had this nasty green mint slime swirled in it.  What really ticked me off was the lack of oreos.  I counted 5 (five!) little chunks of oreo.  The store was clean and the guys behind the counter seemed nice, but I'm still sorry about the purchase.",0
"It's SO FUNNY!! \nYelp is asking for additional tips on Dairy Queen: Beer & Wine Only OR Full Bar!! LMAO!!\nIce cream and fried foods is about all they have, oh and soda! Good grubbin food and ice cream! My fav is the tropical blizard!!\nI don't like their fried foods very much though...Just the ice cream!",1
"If I could give this place a negative rating, I would.  This place doesn't deserve stars. It deserves a big middle finger. The employees in this place ignore the customers. Kids today are not too bright. I don't think they realize where their paychecks come from. But what do they care working for minimum wage? When I was younger I worked fast food and I learned good customer service at that job because no matter how little money I made I took pride in what I did. I hate to sound like an old fuddy duddy but kids these days have no manners or any idea what courtesy is all about. And that's why good customer service is becoming so scarce. Parents don't teach their kids these values anymore and it comes out in the service industry from kids who walk around with this sense of entitlement. \n\nAnyway, go to this DQ if you want to watch a bunch of sour puss teen agers ignore you; if you actually want dessert try Cold Stone or Baskin Robbins.",0
"Horrible lately. How do u wait in line for over 12 minutes and not even get an apology or smile!  I keep shooting my own foot off by going here but i just cannot help it i am addicted to blizzards!! That said, i hate this place....Why is it called fast food when everytime there is a 10 min wait and the staff are very blah and mean!!  I would love it if they shut this location down so i didnt have to get mad at myself for continuing to fall into the trap.",0
This Dairy Queen shows me that it can be worth it to check out yelp reviews for large chain restaurants.  I don't like going to Dairy Queen because it's so banal but banal would be an improvement for this Dairy Queen.\n\nIt was dirtier than my men's dorm room back in college (thankfully since I cleaned up my act) and I ended up paying for an expensive orange juice masquerading as an Orange Julius.,0
If I could give a negative 5 this would be it they could not make fries could not make sundaes got the total wrong gave the wrong change shorting me $5.00 could not provide a receipt DO NOT come here,0
"I really wish the mic didn't have a mute button because the guy taking our order was cussing at customers in the drive through... If you don't like your job, find another one. Awful customer service and crappy ice cream. Oh and a tip for the employees based on my experience and all the bad reviews I've read (obviously isn't a problem just tonight) try smiling once and a while or treat people with respect.",0
This place id FILTHY!!! All the teenies working there need to get off their phones and maybe wipe a table off? Went for a blizzard and there was not one clean table. SERIOSLY?,0
"i don't use profanity in my reviews, but i cannot find any other words that can express the hot wings.  they are so fucking delicious it's ridiculous.  the chicken wing is cooked well, where it gets crispy and is juicy in the middle.  there is little fat, you you are actually eating a chicken wing.  i pretty much ate everything off the bone.  they have many different kinds of sauce you can select, mild to suicide, honey, bbq, and those sweet flavors with heat for any taste you're in the mood for.  the hot sauce (the step down from suicide) with the wing itself, created the most delicious hot wing i ever had.  it had heat and flavor, without too much of a vinegar taste.  i seriously wanted to lick the plate.  on wednesday their special is 10 wings for $3.00.\n\nthe only reason why i did not give this place 5 stars was because of the bartender.  the drinks were weak.  they use canned juice and red bull instead of the bulk or spout kind, which i appreciate the taste.  i went up to the bar and said i wanted to do a shot.  i am spoiled and don't know the names of any shots (my regular bartenders knows what me and my friends like and will just randomly make stuff that he knows we'll like).  i tell the bartender vodka is ok, no tequila, something that tastes kind of like fruit punch.  she rolls her eyes with her hands on her hips and mentions they don't have any fruit punch.  i mention that the only thing i can remember the name of is the around the world, and she told me you can't make that into a shot.  hahahaha, that's pretty much all i know it as, she was ridiculous.  she made this grape and pineapple juice crap that hardly tasted like booze (i saw her pour, it was pretty much just juice).  aside from her, the server, who was nice, got mine and my friends drink mixed up.  she had a red straw in the one she thought was the raspberry, but the mandarin was made in that glass, so we switched.  when i ran out of my drink, i asked for another mandarin red bull and she brought me a raspberry since the red straw was in it. \n\nthey do karaoke on wednesday and another night i cannot remember.  the selection of songs is great.  there were newer songs.  they had amy winehouse, hot hot heat, panic at the disco, fall out boy, the entire rent soundtrack (which my friend was excited about).  the ones i was amazed to see were teddy geiger, ryan adams, and jeff buckley.  and if that wasn't all... fuck her gently by tenacious d.  my friends and i have wanted to sing this song at our bar forever, they wouldn't even let us sing it a capella.  it was so rad to sing it, it was like some great accomplishment.",1
Ghetto biker bar. Okay place to hang out if that's what you are looking for.  I don't like how the shower curtains they use for bathroom doors in the lady's room touch my knees when I sit on the toilet.  Gross.,0
"I am putting a disclaimer on this review by telling you up front... I am a regular. There is a good reason I'm a regular though.The bartenders are awsome and really friendly. The drinks are priced well and the owner has a house beer that is really tastey and even cheaper than the regular beers. The karaeoke host is so nice. Terry (evil T, papa T, etc.) is one of the main reasons I started frequenting this place. There is a huge selection of music. Even if you don't see it in the books, a lot of times if you ask he can find it. Don't be surprised if you get a nickname from him on your first time up. This is a great hole in the wall/dive bar.",1
"I seriously love this place! I'm now becoming one of the regulars who stop by every Tuesday night for the great comedy show that is put on. Some  nights the comedy is a little iffy, but most of the time I am LOL'ing. \n\nI tried the tacos for the 1st time last week and for $1.50 they are some of the best tacos I've ever had! After awhile everyone starts to know you by name, and remembers your drink orders (even if service gets a little slow). The perfect little dive bar for me. =D \n\nI've been searching for a bar like this for sometime and I coudln't be happier that it's right down the road from me.\n\nThe impression everyone gave me was that this was some kind of biker bar, but after you visit you'll find there is a HUGE mixture of people who frequent here. So don't listen to everything you hear, you should really experience this place.\n\nIf you are on the border of checking this place out, just do it! (Esp. if it's a Tuesday!!!)",1
"I discovered Brigitts as a neighborhood activist in the area, but I started going in when my ex-husband left me. I wanted a place close to where I lived that I could go to alone to kill some lonely evenings but be safe and not harassed, meaning not a typical pick up joint. I found the right place. The people were friendly. the staff quickly remembered me and what I drank. I loved the karaoke  with Terry. But eventually I moved and stopped coming in. for a while. LOL Shockingly, I have re-married. My new husband has his own fave neighborhood bar, but it has recently changed hands. So, we know what kinda change THAT brings. The time was ripe to introduce him to Brigitt's. So, we have started coming in and enjoying the food as well as the adult beverages. LOL LOVE the food! Tacos are AMAZING! Great wings. I gotta thing going with the chicken tenders. Everyone comes here. Yes, there are bikers. And guys in suits. Retirees. College age kids. Just plain ole down to earth nice people.Yes, the ladies restroom is a lil cramped. I try to think of it as quirky. But the place has been busy and in business for years. That has to say something, right? This IS the perfect neighborhood where-everyone-knows-your-name bar. I've come back home and this time I am home to stay. With my new husband, of course! :)",1
"I am sad to see the reviews about the poor service because I know exactly which server they had..  and I don't blame them. (The rest of the servers are so friendly, though!)\n\nHowever, this is one of my favorite hang-outs. We live just down the street, so we go at least once a week. The food is out of this world! The wings, burgers, tacos, and sandwiches are so great! Tuesdays are free comedy, Wednesdays are free trivia, and they have karaoke almost every night. One of my favorite aspects of this bar is the mixed crowd. After showing up a few times, the staff and the regulars were waving and saying they were happy to see us again. The crowd sings everything from top 40 to Pantera to oldies. It's definitely a dive, but if you're looking for a friendly crowd, phenomenal food, and giant mugs of beer, this is your place.",1
"This place has AWESOME prices and tacos BUT the service really sucks. I know its a dive bar but I wish they would do a better job at training the servers and bartenders. There is NO greeting when you enter, I've sat at a table for 10 mins before someone asked how they can help me. The waitress passed me up 3 TIMES before serving me. HORRIBLE! However, the prices (Happy Hour) keep bringing me back and I've learned, piss on the waitresses, go to the bar and order your drinks and food, it still may take awhile but definitely a lot faster than waiting on a waitress.",0
"This club has changed a lot over the years, but this version is by far the best. Nice people hanging out and singing karaoke or watching comedy, or what ever brings them in. This is the best karaoke in town, bar none. Pappa T does a great job. The free comedy shows are also the bomb. Great job guys, keep up the good work.",1
"Fun dive bar. I basically only go on Tuesdays, either to perform or watch the standup comedy, so it may be different on other nights. The $1.50 tacos are big and tasty. The beers are cheap but I'd prefer my dive bar drinks stronger and cheaper. Papa T, who runs the Karaoke, is cool character, and the singers seem like they have a lot of fun...\n\nSome people complain about the service but if you just introduce yourself and be proactive you should be fine. I've never had any problems. \n\nThere are always a few bikes out front, but definitely not enough to qualify as a biker bar. Either way, the clientele is cool...Again, this may just be Tuesdays...",1
"Some amazing bar food, trivia Wednesday and Thursday (I'm usually there Thursdays) and the karaoke is awesome. Great drink and food specials. I'm partial to their fish tacos (chipotle mayo, yum!). \n\nPS If you're good at trivia, come Wednesdays, since I'm there with my team on Thursdays ;)",1
"THE BEST DIVE BAR I HAVE EVER BEEN TO!!\n\nI used to live off of Bell Rd. and Tatum Blvd. This place wasn't that far from where I used to live. I used to come in every Friday and Saturday nights. \n\nGreat place, the karaoke is great (I sang there a few times myself), and the drinks are reasonably priced. \n\nSince I moved in 2004, I have only visited it about 3 times since. And the last 3 times were all new people and new bartenders. So I didn't know anyone anymore. The last time I had been in was last year in 2010. I still liked it and only 1 person remembered me. But I still liked it, lol!",1
"Amazingly great food.  Everything  I have tried on the menu has been very tasty, and if you want something specially prepared just ask and they will accomodate.\n\nBrigett's is the only place I know that pours water in and out of your frozen mug before filling it with your favorite beer on tap which provides a wonderfully frozen icy layering in the mug.  It keeps your beer the coldest serving in town!\n\nThe wait staff and bartenders are terrific....",1
"Really nice place. Now that i think of it, i swear ive been here before, though the layout isnt too uncommon.\n\nReally nice people and a fun crowd. Good list of songs. I ended up with a bunch of songs on my list for the night. Actually might be the longest of potential songs for a single evening.\n\nPours were a bit dry but not too bad.\n\nKJ seemed like a really nice guy. A great karaoke experience.\n\nThis is not a place to come dressed up to. It is almost a biker bar but not quite...but close!",1
"Fortunately right now, we live close to Bridgette's!  I love going on a fri or sat night! Constant flow of different customers and they all leave happy! I'm personally in love with the southwest chicken Philly! Think it's the only thing I've ordered in 3 years! The girls that work there have been there forever! Shannna is the best!, she's so sweet!\nLong story short, we love this place!!",1
"Awesome tacos, but I wish they still came one at a time. I wouldn't be upset if they had pizza too... Nice variety of beers on tap, karaoeke isn't as good as it used to be but is still entertaining and free. Cheap. All in all, I'm glad it's my neighborhood bar.",1
"Stopped in on a Saturday afternoon with some friends for a cold one, and it turned out to we stayed for hours. Great table service for a afternoon stop. Good place for friends and conversation.",1
"Ok, we must have been drunk our first time there. We went back 2 more times and it was not good. The last time we were there we ordered the sampler platter that we loved the first time. The chicken was pink inside, and not slightly pink. My wife was in a panic that she'd be sick. The clientele all know each other, and you're either a regular or not, and if not, they're not friendly.",0
"I have been here 4 different times. The first time I went I thought it was a decent place which is why I returned. Each visit after the first proved to be worse than the time before. The last time I went, which was about a month ago, my roommate and I went to celebrate her birthday with a drink. The bartender completely ignored us for the first almost 10 minutes we were there. She made eye contact with us when we walked in and just resumed her conversation with the person she was talking to (the said person was not ordering anything). Finally after waiting she did come over and take our order. \nThe temperature in the bar was really uncomfortably warm, especially for it being Phoenix in May. The bathrooms are sooo tiny and claustrophobically small and they don't have real doors on the stalls.\nI honestly can say I will not be returning to this place...",0
"Brigett's is a biker bar yet welcomes people from all walks of life.  I hadn't been in a while but stopped in last night with my mom to have dinner and play trivia.  Their menu has changed slightly and definitely for the better!  I had the fish tacos and they were fantastic.  They were topped with a tasty spicy mayo and fresh veggies as well as homemade guac on the side. 2 for $6.  My mom had french toast and eggs (they serve breakfast all day) and I just had to sneak a bite because the FT smelled so good!  They have several Mexican inspired dishes on their menu as well as burgers, sandwiches and salads.\n\nWe arrived too late to take advantage of their fantastic happy hour (drinks starting at $2!) but will definitely be back for it!\n\nFor those who enjoy Karaoke, they have it most (if not all?) nights of the week starting at 9:30 or so.  They also have plenty of televisions, 2 pool tables and video games (I believe I saw Goldentee) a horseshoe bar with about 20 stools and about 15 hightop tables that are easily pushed together to accomodate larger groups.",1
"I wouldn't even give it one star if I didn't have to, I've gone to Bridgette's a few times. I had a good time the first night, but, noticed nobody in my party got to sing more than once. (I think it was a fluke that we sang at all) The second time wasn't even as great, we had friends from out of town with us that wanted to sing and some people in our party didn't get to sing at all. The last time I was there I was with a friend that's gay and he was treated like dirt in the bar. It's not a great neighborhood bar, it's a horrible place for karaoke (unless you're one of the karaoke dj's special friends), they aren't accepting of all types of people, and I had terrible service the last 2 times I went. I tried to give the place a chance, but, it's just not a good bar.",0
"I went on Monday to go to a Karaoke bar, but there wasn't any Karaoke going on, there website says it goes on every night. It took 10 years for anyone to take my order, and when I asked what was good to eat I got a, It's all good, response. How does that make it easy to decide what to order? Then I spent another few hours waiting for the check. The food was good, but it's just like any other food. Nothing special about it. I really felt like an outsider coming to this place. Not very welcoming. Maybe I should have gone on a busier night when the staff actually would want to work.",0
The karaoke host terry is the best but the girl karaoke host I'm not sure what her name is but she's more interested in putting her friends on before other patrons that have been going the bar for years hopefully she'll get replaced or realize that she needs to make the regular's a priority as well I always have a good time here but she makes me want to go somewhere else and come back when terry is there.,0
The karaoke host that is a short white bald guy sux!!!!!!\nHe totally put a pillow so to speak on me and my husbands microphones\nI have been coming here for years and all of a sudden this ridiculous karaoke hits shows up and ruins my entire experience! \nEven the other girl host says no one likes him and we for sure hate him,0
"Well let's just start off by saying.. I don't drink I am just the dedicated driver. First bar I've been to that doesn't offer their DD's free sodas. With out the DD's there wouldn't be the drinkers. So that's a bad business move.  So on to the karaoke, the top hat guy plays the favorite game. That to is a bad business move. I was here with a party of about 25 drinking people.  Celebrating 2 birthday's and they came from all over the valley.  Had nothing but good things to say about this place but not no more. The group got their request in as soon as the karaoke got started. Well none of them have been called up to take the mic as of 2 hours into this. None are to pleased and now are leaving. Sounds like a big loss of money to the bar because they are taking their business elsewhere.",0
"My friends and I came here on Saturday and I was really excited about it because I hadn't been to Bridgette's in so long. The night started off really well! My drinks were good, the nachos were to die for, and the karaoke was really getting going. My favorite song was being sung and I (stupidly) stood up on my chair (we do this at another karaoke bar that we frequently visit so it's a bad habit) and I was quickly told to sit down (in a very polite manner) by the manager. Naturally I sat down right away and apologized. I know she was just concerned about my safety. I had been sitting down for not even twenty seconds and I had one of my feet tucked under my bottom (I would like to stress that my bottom was still ON the chair) when another waitress named Mercedes came over pointing at me and said \""""sit your ASS on the chair.\"""" I was kind of taken aback. I was thinking \""""did I hear that right? Is this real life?\"""" I've had interesting experiences in restaurants before but this one takes the cake. I've never witnessed anything so unprofessional in my life. She eventually came over and apologized but it was kind of forced and unauthentic. She then started talking about my friends and I in a negative manner to some friends she had there while she was still working and we were still in the building. I won't ever be back. I was really upset and, even more so, embarrassed. It ruined my whole night despite my best efforts to continue having a good time. A friend of mine was talking about wanting to have her bachelorette party there but after I told her this story she agreed that we won't be doing that.",0
They over serve.,0
"If you're looking for a good dive bar, this place is for you. Staff is friendly and drinks are reasonably priced.",1
My wife & I love this place !  It my be the best place in PHX for taco's no lie !!  Tue is the nite to go !,1
"5 Star Dive bar is right! If you're into Karaoke, this is your new local spot for sure. Reasonable drink prices and they have my Hunting Video Game! 5blks from the new house! I'd go back!",1
"Worst. Fucking. Place. EVER.\n\nWalked in with a Romo jersey after the Cowboys won, the bartender yelled at his buddies at the bar Homo. AMERICA, the.land of the free.",0
"Won't go back, local vibe, bad music, slow service",0
"I vow to avoid this store as much as possible. Smugness is not a virtue yet some of the employees at this store can teach a class on it.  I did shop here knowing their prices were high yet it was convenient.  \nYet due to their employees poor attitudes, other stores will get my business.",0
"I'm a sucker for home mailer coupons so I decided to try this salon for a discounted \""""spa pedicure\"""". My first impression was that it looked a little rundown and not too clean. I was immediately led to a massage chair which looked worn. There was one other customer getting a pedicure when I arrived. The woman who sat down to do my pedicure was pissed off and seemed sick. Yikes! I wanted to leave but she already had my feet soaking in (lukewarm) water (no liner). I wasn't given a menu of pedicure options. She barely looked up at me and just slapped my legs whenever she needed me to move. She coughed into her arm and looked miserable. She also spent most of the time looking angry and yelling in another language at the man who worked there. They were clearly arguing. She rushed through my pedicure and was looking away most of the time. Instead of the relaxing experience, I was stressed out, afraid that she was going to cut me with the nail clippers! The polish was done sloppily and the nails weren't cut straight. She rolled her chair over to work on someone else without even looking at me to acknowledge that she was done. After several awkward minutes I started to get up from the chair. She yelled-\""""no move!!\"""" Then a sullen young man (teenager?) who'd been standing around came over to put my flip flops on my feet. I walked to the front with him and he stood in front of the register without saying anything. I handed him the coupon and money. No one looked at me or said thanks for coming. \nThat's what I get for trying to save a few bucks! From now on I'll go to my usual place across the street.",0
"Ok so like growing up Denny's was the spot especially for the church folk and that is how I was raised until about 13, anyway this spot had it all and once when I was on a road trip with my Dad,stepmom and little brother all we did was eat a Denny's from Ca to the ATL that and the occaisional Waffle house. But somehow I stopped going to Denny's and now they have changed and this is for the better. They have brought back the free breakfast grand slam and they have menu options in $2, $4, $6, and $8 options plus their faithful standbys. I am talking about the Super Bird people the best sandwich for the last 4 decades.  Anyway in this economy sometimes you want to just chill out and talk to your friends and Denny's has always been that and so much more for me. Reunited and it feels so good.",1
Denny's always available after the club! Cheep food and service! It's what's for breakfast at 230 I'm the morning!!,0
"I'm happy to hear that some folks out there have good things to say about this Denny's but I don't! I live close by and Denny's usually has great breakfast, it's safe and you know what your getting however; this location breaks the norm. I've given it the benefit of the doubt so many times, but no more. \n\n    Slow Service\n    Cold food\n    Incorrect orders\n    If you like hot tea....good luck getting more hot water\n    The staff doesn't check on you after receiving your meal\n    No WiFi service\n    Dirty silverware\n\nI dislike this Denny's so much that I actually logged in to write about it. The last time I did this was years ago. THEY SUCK.\n\nA discriminating foodie. \n\nGroovygirlaz",0
Food & service is usually really good.,1
"We had planned on eating a late breakfast at the Original Breakfast House just down 32nd Street, but did not realize that they would be closed for Labor Day. We headed north toward the Harkins North 16 Cinema and stumbled upon Denny's.  We still had plenty of time before our movie, or so we thought.\n\nThe entryway was warm and crowded with people waiting.  Only a ten minute wait was indicated, so we decided to stay.  When we were seated, we noticed the restaurant itself seemed a bit warm as well.  We waited a very long time just to have our presence recognized by a server.  Eventually, beverage orders were taken.  Coffee was delivered without an offer of creamer and we labored another five minutes just to make eye contact with anyone who could bring us some.  Food orders were finally taken and were served in a reasonable amount of time, although there was a significant amount of time between when the first person in our party and the last was served.  Not a big deal, but it's awkward to postpone eating until everyone is served and awkward when they insist that you go ahead and eat.\n\nWell, it's Denny's.  The food was fine.  Uninspired.  Just what you'd expect.  Given that you can eat at a really good breakfast joint just a few blocks away, however, I'm just not sure why you'd want to settle for this.  I'm pleased that the Original Breakfast House treats their employees well with the day off, but I doubt that I would ever head back to Denny's anytime OBH was open.\n\nBy the time we were finishing, we had used all of our available time and felt as though we'd been eating in a sauna.  The restaurant never cooled down.  Not revealed to us when we checked in was the not insignificant fact that their air conditioning was broken.  Not all of their air conditioning.  Only the part where their patrons were seated.  Revealing this tidbit of information to customers when they came in the door would have been the honorable thing to do.  Yes, we probably would have elected to go elsewhere, but it's what any good restaurant would do for their customers.  But not Denny's.      \n\nThis Denny's is nice in appearance and some employees seem well intentioned.  When you are serving \""""average\"""" food, however, it's critical that employees and managers go above and beyond to compensate. That did not happen on this day.  Not even close.",0
"Over 5 mins to get seated, 5 mins for drinks, 20 mins later, no one even took our order. Only 4 tables in the whole restaurant! We have a baby and a three year old, and they wasted all the time we would've had to have a family dinner, so we left.",0
"I first want to say that I have gone to this Denny's now for the past two years and have never had an issue.  Tonight was that night.  I called in an order and was told it would be ready in ten minutes... standard for them.  I got there and 30 minutes later still had no food in my hand.  I asked to see the manager and the explanation she gave was, \""""We've never had this many people come in on a Thursday.\""""  She never apologized nor offered to make it right in any way.  I asked for my money back  I am no food service expert, but the goal of any food service establishment is to make sure customers keep coming back.  She totally failed to fix the situation.  I think it is time to take a break from this place.  The service is not what it used to be two years ago.  I will say that the people working there are very friendly.  Maybe I caught them on a bad night but I won't be back for a while.  Beware the wait time if you dare to eat here!",0
Food was blah. Nothing special. Kim our waitress brought her kids to work they were seated next to us. They screamed bloodly murder the entire time and every time they did she would go over to them. Your at work not at home. She never came over to check on us or anything more concern about her kids.,0
"Well, the glass of water was okay.  After 5 to 10 minutes, someone came and offered me that.  I was seated at the counter and made eye contact with several servers who went about with their conversations or just standing there.  Lots of standing there.  10 minutes later, no order taken, though 5 servers huddled around in front of me waiting for the food to cook. Others who arrived after me had their orders taken, I decided I was hungry and needed food, so I went to get some, down the street.  I wish this weren't the first time I went in thinking maybe this time they would be attentive.",0
The hostess service is great. The waitress service is very poor. Had to ask twice for water. we were ignored and mocked.,0
"The service is lousy.  First it took a while to get a waiter. Then he was slow with the drinks. After that he was really slow with the food and never came with refills.  \nWe finally got the food. they forgot part of my order and my friends were mixed up. We never got the check either.  So we ended going up to the cashier and he pulled it. When we finally get in the car, I figure we spent an hour and 45 minutes! ! \nUnless you want to waste time DON'T GO TO THIS DENNYS.",0
"Terrible service but edible food.\n\nWhen we came in I asked for a corner booth but was told they were all closed so I had to sit in a center booth. Really? The section is open but not the corner?\n\n It took 44 minutes for our food and the omelet was served with unmelted processed cheese slices. I ordered the Tuscan Super Bird... poorly prepared,  way too much mayo, wrong bread.  Worse Dennys experience ever.",0
"I go to Denny's for one thing.  Their good old fashioned turkey club sandwich.  I tried the closest one (2120 E. Cactus Rd.) but will not go back.  Their waitresses act like they never made it out of training and are quick to blame the cooks for their long delays and messing up orders.\n\nSo I have gone a few times to their location at 3205 E. Bell Rd..  Today, as I was picking up the fourth quarter of my turkey club, A ROACH WAS CRAWLING AROUND UNDER IT.\n\nThe manager ultimately came over and said she had been there 3 months and that hasn't happened before.  I said, \""""Three months?  This Denny's has been here a lot longer than you.  You call that an excuse?\""""  \n\nYes, she gave me another to go at no charge for either.  The waitress who made it up told me she made it herself and is sure there are no roaches in it.  So that is what it takes to compensate for a dirty kitchen?\n\nPrior to the last few months, I haven't set foot in a Denny's in twenty years.  Now I know why!",0
"Sat down with my buddie for a late night dinner, I was starving and thought a 10oz sirloin sounded good, the waiter was a absolute joke, a kid who looked like he needed a nap , came over took our order ..he knew nothing about the menu or the sides that came with it, when i got my meal he never brought over any steak sauce, or anything had to ask him for EVERYTHING. then he asked for my visa but the guy never ran it. the food was good actually but the service just isnt gonna fly.",0
Service is terrible at this location. We saw several people leave because their food was taking to long. Took forever for a server to take our order and had to wait to check out. Won't come back to this location.,0
"I used to love this place back in high school, so I decided to drop in for a delicious protein smoothie. \nI ordered a medium high protein smoothie, and was absolutely salivating over the upcoming flavor as I hadn't eaten all day.\n\n Well my first disappointment came with the price, a whopping $10.00 for a d*mn medium smoothie! Holy cow! What are they adding to this to make it so god-like you ask? I have no idea, my only add on was friggin peanut butter, which was only a small dollop. \n\nMy second complaint was the service, although it wasn't awful, it certainly didn't entice me to ever want to return. \n\nI think I will stick with One Stop Nutrition, I can get the same exact smoothie, with peanut butter, for $5.00. \n\nI'm not trying to bring the gavel down on this place, but they certainly need to double check their prices, I definitely don't taste the quality or see the justification in charging an arm and a leg.",0
"If you want to be treated rude by the staff and enjoy sub par smoothies then this is the place for you.   I love smoothies and had never been to a Smoothie King and was in the area so decided to give it a try.  Big Mistake!!  When I entered the store there was an older man towards the front and a younger girl making smoothies towards the back.   The place only had about two people in it.   No greeting given by the older man at the front.   The menu here is very, very hard to decipher.   The menu board is so discombobulated you don't know what end is up.   It lists the name of the smoothie for example, \""""Cranberry Cooler\"""" or \""""Immune Builder\"""" but they don't list what is in these smoothies.    You have to look at a \""""to-go\"""" menu to have the smoothie ingredients explained.   I asked the older man what was in the \""""electrolyte mix\"""" (as this was listed as part of the ingredients in a smoothie I was considering)  his answer to me was \""""ARE YOU KIDDING?\""""   \""""You have electrolytes in your body.  They are minerals\""""    I have no idea why I even continued with my order after this rude treatment.   Anyway,  I ordered a \""""Light and Fluffy\"""" smoothie.    Basic ingredients;  OJ, Banana, Strawberry.   It was average at best.     On the expensive side too.  Over $5.00 for a small.   Sorry for the long review but this place deserves only one star.",0
The guys working here seemed very bothered I wanted to purchase a smoothie.  Very unfriendly!!,0
"I've been to this location a couple of times with an OK experience, but tonight we arrived 3 minutes before closing and the clerk had already turned off the open sign and locked the door.  We tried to walk up to see if he would change his mind but he wouldn't even look up for at least a minute, endlessly staring at the floor or at the walls in an attempt to avoid eye contact...low class move.  I would have minded less had he simply acknowledged us and said \""""sorry we're closed\"""".  It was almost closing time - I understand wanting to go home - but regardless it's not the way to treat customers.\n\nI have contacted what I presume is Smoothie King management (Greg) about this as well.",0
"Although the smoothies are quite delicious, it is FAR from natural. Everything is frozen and preserved, i've noticed. This pisses me off! They advertise like they are healthy and support the customer's well being when in reality they're just sticking all this sugar down our throats. I soon realized after I ordered my drink (for the first time) that it had about 800 calories for a small and 70 grams of sugar!! Not so healthy if you ask me. \n\nThe management is corrupt. They always made the poor employees work alone and although it would get incredibly busy, they didn't seem to mind. This comes across as SELFISH, and I refuse to support a company that operates in such a way. In addition to this, Sean (tall black guy) would always try hitting on me, he has made uncomfortable remarks and he was VERY unproffessional. He would stand and talk to me for hours and I CANNOT deal with that when I have obligations to address on a daily basis. This made me dread coming into Smoothie king. Overall this place is trash, I definatley wouldn't recommend it.",0
Great smoothies. Lots of options - almost too many to make a decision. But very tasty and great protein options.,1
"FILTHY! NASTY! UNSANITARY PLACE!! I am new in the area and get my nails and feet done every other week.... I seen this nail ssalon on Yelp and decided to treat myself and find a Salon I can keep coming back too.... Not only was this place Super small, but VERY UNSANITARY!!! When doing my pedicure they did not take out anything new out the package but pulled out a dirty box and used it on my feet. I looked around and seen NAIL DUST everywhere like they havent cleaned or wiped anything down in months or years!! I sat down to get my Nails filled and looked at the displays on the walls and cabinets filled with nail dust and fingernail clippings. Dirty walls.... I thought to myself NEVER AGAIN will I come back here. I sat down on the otherside of the room to dry my nails in the dryer and looked under the dryer and nail clippings and more nail dust inside the dryer! HOW DOES THAT WORK??? I aint never out of 15 years of getting my nails done seen a place this FILTHY!!! Can u say NAIL FUNGUS! DONT GO THERE!!!!",0
"I would first like to say my sister had a bad experience here before me. However I was happy with the quality of the nails they do. We do however go elsewhere for pedis. \nSo I taked my sister in to comming back and guess what... they do good nails but customer service is horrible. \nThe lady who was doing her nails was on the phone the the whole time. (ordering cable). \nThere was an issue with the gel polish my sister got peeling off so we wnt back to get it fixed. We told the lady how rude it was of the other lady to be talking on the phone. She said... :\"""" well she was still doing her job\"""".  \""""maybe it was important\""""\n\nMy thought is I guess it was important if you are willing to lose 2 customers. \nI wish they were better at customer service but they have lost me as a customer forever.",0
Poor customer service.,0
"horrible customer service. waited 20 minutes to get my eyebrows done as a walk-in. they kept telling me just two minutes. they took 6 people ahead of me. so i stood up a collected my keys and wallet from the chair next to me and they didn't say a word so i just walked out. and there was dust everywhere. will never go back!\n\nif i could post no stars, i would.",0

Where to start......\n\nI called the store I usually deal with here in Pasadena, He gave me this Autozone's phone number, and told me that they handled commercial accounts, and had the fuel pump in stock.

When we got there, Tara was really quick to help us out...but then...out of nowhere, comes this \""""commercial Manager\"""" I think his name was Tom....I told him of the problem I was having, and telling him that this was the second time THEIR fuel pump had failed...\n\nwhat it was doing, was not marking correctly how much gas my truck had....I filled up the tank with 80 dollars, and it told me that I had 6 miles to empty....we would start to drive, and maybe 15 minutes later...it would shoot up to half a tank, then....5 more minutes, it would shoot all the way up to full!\n\nHERE'S WHERE IT GOT DICEY, THE FIRST THING HE DID, WAS SAY TO ME...\""""OH, THE FUEL PUMP IS GOOD, ITS PUMPING FUEL RIGHT? \""""yes\"""" THEN THE PROBLEM IS YOUR TRUCK, ITS NOT READING THE SENDING UNIT ON THE FUEL PUMP!! CHECK YOU WIRING, OR TAKE IT TO A CERTIFIED 12 VOLT SPECIALIST!!\n\nHELLO!! WTF DO YOU THINK I AM!!! I DO 12 VOLT FOR A LIVING BUDDY!! DAMN NEAR 15 YEARS!!! \n\nSo I started to explain to this know it all, that its not the first time it has happened, it happened once before, and logically, its not possible...my OEM fuel pump failed, because the pump went out.....not the fuel pump sending unit..\n\nWhats happening here, is that Autozone is selling 2nd hand products, I am never buying from them again...and as for Mr. Know it all...my buddy, who was with me, is a 28 year mechanic, I have been a 12 volt installer for 15 years....next time, just shut the hell up and sell me what I need. I understand you want to stand behind your company, but I wasn't there to argue with you, I was there to get my damn truck fixed so I could come back to California....\n\nJust a quick update, both of the fuel pumps, that i bought from autozone, came apart inside my gas tank....the first one, came out in 4 pieces, the second one came out in 2....what kind of crap are the selling over there....if this pump fails, I think a lawsuit is in order, I can't be dropping my gas tank every 6 months because of this crap!!! NO BUENO AUTOZONE....\n\nMy commercial account is going to buy anything from you either!!!",0
"Waited long enough in line to write this review with 15 min extra to spare.\n\nOh, yeah. There is no line. I'm just standing here at the counter with cash in hand as every employee here wonders around aimlessly. \n\nUse the oreilly's  auto parts across the street.",0
"The guys and gals that work here have always been efficient and helpful. They are not a service station, but will give you advice. Please don't rate them poorly because they didn't fix your car. You need to know what's wrong and have an idea of how to fix it before you come here. They will loan you some tools to change a battery or do very small repairs (if you are lucky they will even do it for you).",1
"This place used to be well friendlier/nicer. My mom is a licensed professional for the last 30 years. Sometime's she need's emergency supplies while at work, who better to get them but her daughter that has nothing better to do. In a way I am her assistant I have been doing this since I was able to drive so 13 yrs. I used to be able to do this for her without any problem's. The new management however left me no choice but to shop somewhere else. \n\nThe last visit was very unpleasant from the beginning and my mother was with me no less! We were not greeted or helped in any way. I asked the manager where a product was she said they got rid of it and rushed off in a hurry. We finished our shopping and went to check out, now the manager started giving my mom a hard time about not having her license. Most people have them on wall's at work, why would she carry it around w her?!?! My mother is in their system and has been for ages why give her a hard time now? The girl finally does something un-lazy and goes online to check my mom's status it took forever so yay right?! Now we're getting somewhere...wrong!! \n\nThe girl wouldn't let me pay because I am not licensed!! At this point I am mad and it takes alot to make me mad. I ended up leaving the store they did not get any money that time and we will not be returning, they dont even carry the product we went there for to begin with but were still willing to spend $ anyway. It was clear they didnt need our sale's anymore so I will be happy somewhere else.",0
"I am awaiting my license and went in to get some supplies and the woman behind the counter was friendly as she always is. She actually showed me how to go online and check to see if I passed my tests, which I didn't know how to do and told me what to do once I do receive my license in the mail. After realizing I'd forgot something I needed to go back later on and another woman helped me look for another product. I have found that the people at Armstrong are always helpful and willing to help.",1
"Update: I only wish they took American Express! They'd have a lot more business if they did. \n\nIt has been very hard to find a decent nail salon since I've moved from San Diego to Phoenix but FINALLY I've found a great place! Both Don and Theresa have done my nails and they've turned out beautifully every time. Best of all, it's affordable. I highly recommend them to all. :)",1
"It seems like they may have talent at this salon, but I wasn't able to really experience it.  They seemed to prioritize quantity over quality.  I made an appointment and they were running behind so I had to wait 30 minutes.  The reason they're running behind is because they say yes to every walk in.  My nails are all uneven lengths.  I think they charge too much for powder acrylics.\n\nI also advised the nail tech that one of my nails was coming up, and she told me no it wasn't without even looking.  well it's still coming up and feels like it'll pop off",0
"Another great Italian find!\n\nMy BF and I went to Roma Garden for dinner last night because he was given a gift certificate there from a friend.  We'd never heard of it, but we're always up for trying something new, especially with $50 towards our meal.  We pulled up to their strip mall location without expectations and we were both pleasantly surprised!\n\nWhen you walk in, the lighting and decor are welcoming and the staff is friendly and attentive.  It was a Thursday night and there were plenty of other guests in the restaurant, and there was a lively energy in the air.  After browsing the menu, I ordered one of the few 'Chef's Specials' of the night - tilapia with fresh veggies and pasta in a lemon caper sauce.  BF went with Pollo Parmagiana.  He had a glass of cabernet and I had pinot grigio... and voila - a warm bread basket arrived on our table at just the right time!\n\nWe were both happy with our orders when they arrived as well... the fish was cooked just right and the sauce was tasty... good portions as well!  Although we were full, we decided to order a dessert to share - the homemade snow white chocolate tartufo - yum!  The perfect sweet ending to our meal.  In addition, we were each brought an after dinner drink of amaretto on the rocks, on the house.\n\n****I just have to share that I was pleasantly surprised that the women's restroom was clean, spacious, and had a fresh fragrance to it - I normally don't notice that, but I was impressed by this!\n\nIn speaking to the waiter and the owner, we learned that this restaurant recently changed locations but they've been in business for over 15 years.  Gotta love the local businesses that last in the valley... we'll be back to support Roma Garden and enjoy their fine \""""Northern Italian Cuisine\"""" without a doubt.  I suggest you go check it out also - bon appetito!",1
"Culinary Adventure #2 in Phx went MUCH MUCH better than #1. \n\nThis is a place my dad frequents, and kept talking about all day so I was eager to give it a shot. As we were driving up I noticed it was in a stripmall-esque area and I was like \""""Daaaad...why always the strip mall places\"""". But as soon as we got in - definitely a different atmosphere than I expected. The front area is a decent bar and a waiting area; the TV in the corner was showing the ASU/UofA Bball game. There were about 4 tables full in there but it was after 8pm on a Wednesday so, I didn't hold that against them at all. \n\nEveryone knew my dad and greeted our table with warm smiles. Some quips about the Cards and we ordered; my dad pretty much knew what was good so we went with that. \n\nBread was awesome - a nuttier bread which I am always a fan of. Get the garlic butter to spread on - mmmm. We got a 'special' meal that my dad concocted that he's evidently had there numerous times - grilled (not breaded) eggplant, and a side of penne with peppers/mushrooms in an al diavolo sauce. Very good. The sauce was especially spectacular. \n\nThe service was nice - attentive yet not intrusive. Best. After clearing our plates and bringing out dessert, they brought over some amaretto on the rocks 'to wash down our meal'. What a nice touch!\n\nI had nothing bad to say about this place, except for I don't think people know much about it since it's tucked into a stripmall next to (I think) a dry cleaner or some other inane business. Highly recommended and I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Phx!",1
"Not since the likes of \""""Pronto's\"""" and \""""Il Pescatore\"""" has Phoenix tasted Italian food like this.  Yes, it's in a strip mall, but don't let that fool you.  This place is 100% top quality Italian!  Besides, what place in Phoenix isn't in a strip mall these days?  \n\nMy wife found a review of this little gem online and said we had to check it out.  I'm so glad she did! We arrived and were promptly seated.  The wait staff was attentive, but not overly so.  We had our choice of seats which was a nice touch.  The wine list is more than adequate with many nice selections available by the glass.  The bread was nice and warm with really nice pesto/garlic butter.  Our salads arrived promptly, I had the Caesar and it was very good.  Our entree's followed shortly thereafter and this is pretty much where my mind gets foggy...\n\nI had veal...it was heavenly, lightly breaded and oh-so tender.  It was bathed in a lemon sauce; much like you'd find in a piccata dish, but instead of capers, it had artichokes and mushrooms.  Did I mention heaven?  If artichokes or mushrooms aren't to your liking, the veal piccata that my wife had was amazing!  I'm actually a little jealous that she \""""Out-Ordered\"""" me this time.  Her Gnocchi Pasta was a side dish of perfection.  The texture was a perfect firmness and not overcooked.  The pink sauce was again, Heavenly.\n\nWe finished our dinner with coffee and tiramisu.  It was again; Heavenly.  Are you noticing a trend?\n\nThere were also plenty of options for vegetarians.  Eggplant parmesan and spaghetti come to mind.  For fine Italian food, I'd say that Roma Garden is fairly priced.  Two salads, two entr\u00e9e's, one glass of wine, one iced tea, one coffee and one shared dessert later, we left for less than $70 before tip. Our last bit of Heavenly bliss occurred when the waiter brought us our bill.  He also brought us complementary drinks of amaretto on the rocks.  (I really gotta stop writing these reviews before lunch.) Bonnito Appetito!",1
"I heard good things about this place and thought I'd bring my daughters there for dinner.  I ordered shrimp parmesan for 20 dollars and got four overcooked shrimp covered in sauce with watery white rice on the side.  My daughter ordered Linguini with clams and it was too gritty for her to eat.  I literally heard her bite into a sandy clam.  My other daughter ordered fettucini alfredo which was decent.  The best part of the meal was the bread served beforehand.  Even the caesar salad was disappointing.  I have to say that for a $75 tab, there are plenty of other places I would rather go.",0
"Had the chance to FINALLY try this place the other night.  Italian food isn't usually our first choice, but our interest ( and hunger) got the better of us that night. The place is very cozy...not over done in Italian motif and very unpretentious.  We were seated quickly and after being served water we treated to a review of some delicious sounding specials.  We chatted  a bit about it and decided on the Veal Osso Bucco and Scallops, both in a wine sauce,  with pasta and vegetables.  Before our meals came, we were treated to some awesome piping hot bread!  We would have had more, but wanted to save room for dinner.....we would go there just for the bread! \nOur waiter was very attentive and it didn't take long for our food to arrive.   Fabulous choices!  Both the veal and the fish were super tender and left us wanting more...even though we were stuffed.  The scallops were pretty big and they threw in a few jumbo shrimp on top for good measure.....also perfectly cooked.  The pasta was also prepared just right and the vegetables were the best we have ever been served.  Our order was not cheap, however we are interested in coming back to try some of the regular items on the menu.  The meal was topped of with a complimentary shot of chilled ammaretto....delish!",1
"This is the best Northern Italian place in Phoenix and the best I have ever been to in all my travels.  It is hiding in a strip mall right next to a water place and Panda takeout.  But if you brave the folks looking for their next fix of orange chicken you will find a place that meets every one of my (high) expectations.\n\nThe food is fresh, full of flavor and cooked perfectly (and I should know I cooked at gourmet restaurants for years).  They do have an extensive menu, but the gems are usually the specials.  Their specials are whatever they found that is the freshest and yummiest. And if you want it prepared in a specific way, no problem--it will be perfect.  I have never had a bad meal.  The service is friendly, they remember your name and  preferences such as your flavor of vodka and that you don't like one dish served on the same plate as another.\n\nRun, don't walk, and have the best Northern Italian meal you have ever had.",1
Amazing place. I had the swordfish with pasta and fresh veggies. Delicious great service! Although the check was a little late the waiter brough amaretto on the rocks to apologize!,1
"...And now I know what Italian food is supposed to taste like.\n\nIf there's one thing I hate, it's when I can make any style of food better than a restaurant that supposedly specializes in it. A Filipino kid born in Texas should NOT be able to make better Italian food than venues that claim mastery over the cuisine, and yet more often than not -- at least here in Arizona -- that has been the case. Even at good restaurants, my food was at least comparable in quality. Not the case here -- not even close. Roma Garden laughs at my cooking. Roma Garden's power level is over 9000. All my base are belong to Roma Garden. \n\nAfter reading the glowing reviews from both Hilary K. and Gabi M., I rallied to get my family to eat here in celebration of my sister's graduation. Inconspicuously nestled in a strip mall where it shares a wall with a Panda Express, Roma Garden does not look like the kind of place that would serve some of the best Italian food in Arizona. The interior is far nicer than the outside suggests. It's very cosy, but the unusually large chairs make it a tad difficult to get seated. Entry into the seat closest to the wall was akin to scooting across the seat in a booth. We had little issue with this because none of had to use the restroom during our visit, but I imagine that this would be quite annoying for tables with more active bladders.\n\nThe whole menu looks rather large, but in reality a lot of the dishes are just repeats of other dishes, but with different proteins. Not a complaint, just a note.\n\nWe started off with the calamari, because it tends to be a good indicator of a restaurant's style. The calamari were breaded slightly more than I would have liked, but I prefer a very light breading. By traditional standards, I'm sure these were just fine. Not the best I've had, but definitely good.\n\nMy braised lamb shank, on the other hand, was stellar. The shank was cooked perfectly -- braised just enough to maintain its integrity, while requiring very little coaxing to remove from the bone. The uncomplicated flavor of the lamb worked so well with the chianti-tomato sauce, and pasta on the side was great, too. Our waiter said they make their own pasta, although I'm not sure that if the pasta I ate was homemade. No matter. The sauce killed. The lamb killed. My culinary hubris: massacred.\n\nMy sister had the osso bucco; my mom had the pollo Roma Garden; and my dad had the shrimp scampi. All the dishes on the table looked equally appetizing, but I can't say I'd have ordered differently if I could go back and do it again. My dish was just too awesome.\n\nWe finished the night with some tiramisu, which, while not a revelation, was very good. I enjoy mine with a hint of rum in it, but my whole family enjoyed it, and so I was overall happy with it.\n\nService was very friendly. Our server, whose name unfortunately escapes me, was enthusiastic-bordering-on-corny, but I'll take that over lazy and lackadaisical any day. He was on top of everything and very eager to field questions about the food. No complaints here.\n\nThe restaurant is less than a mile from my parents' house, and so it seems criminal to not pay Roma Garden a visit the next time I'm in Phoenix. It's not cheap, but the huge portions and even bigger flavors have me won. Definitely my current favorite Italian restaurant.",1
"Roma Garden is a nice, small place that is great for a romantic dinner with your loved one. The food was good and rich in quality. I believe the menu is mostly $14+ items. The waitstaff is very friendly and do their best to make your evening out as comfortable as possible.",1
"okay so the veal was \""""good\"""", but to advertise as good for kids and not have booster or high chairs is a stretch to say the least.",0
The food and the atmosphere were great.  Not what I expected from a place in a strip mall.  I would definitely recommend giving it  a try!,1
"The left over chicken parm was so much better the next day, I am craving it now, so I have to bump up a star.  The alfredo and lasagna may not bring me back, but the chicken parm would for sure.",1
I have been to this restaurant several time and it seems here quality has gone down hill. After the sloppy lasagna I got last time i figured I would give them another chance but only time find they have slipped even further! I will not be back for a third rip off. Prices are way to high..,0
"Don't be fooled by the location in a strip mall.  Go there.  It's some of the best food I've had in Phoenix.  We showed up with 6 people and no reservation.  No problem!  It's clearly a place with a solid base of regulars, as evidenced by the gregarious interaction between the staff and patrons.  Two of the people in our party had not been to the new location since they moved from Bell Rd., and so were hoping it was still as good as it used to be, and it did not disappoint!   My father ordered veal (can't remember honestly if it was parm or marsala), and said it was some of the best he had ever tasted.  Three of us ordered the Pollo Piemontese and LOVED it.  Reasonably priced, beautifully presented, and the staff is top-notch.  We were so full from dinner that we declined dessert, and as a treat the owner sent over an after-dinner aperitif on the house.  You don't get treated like that every day, now do you?  I'll be back next time i'm in Phoenix, you can count on that.",1
"The food at this place is amazing. Blows olive garden away Big Time. So far best Italian restaurant in Phoenix. Great food, great atmosphere. Only draw back is it's a little small. Other than that would of been 5 star",1
I went there with a friend last year after reading so many good reviews. The service is good. We didn't have to wait but I didn't like the food I ordered. I had a salmon with caper butter sauce. The fish is not fresh at all and the food is too geasy for me.,0
"Excellent atmosphere, great for a romantic date, good mood lighting, and knowledgable staff. The food was fantastic and I nearly just ate the bread they served as filler. I had the chicken cacciatore which came recommended by the waiter, I'd definitely go back here again.",1
"Love this place feels like NYC littlie italy, cooking is authentic prices are amazingly reasonable service is the best.  Will NEVER GO anywhere else for good Italian home cooking.",1
Wonderful dinner. Totally enjoyed the eggplant parm and the polo Roma Garden. Service was great. (thanks Jen). Would definitely return.  Italian cooking at it's BEST.,1
"I'm not usually a fan of italian food, but this place has a great menu! Very cozy feel to the place.",1
"First the cons: Yes, the decor is dated. With full on Italian music playing. And it was a little pricey for a neighborhood Italian place.\n\nBut it gets 4 stars because the food was really good and the service. Everyone there was very friendly and warm, and they really seemed to care that you enjoy your meal.",1
"Run, don't walk to Roma Garden.  You could miss this if you're not looking carefully, (hint:  it faces 40th street)  as it is just a strip mall storefront, but inside it is much better than expected.  Just the decor itself will wow you.  We went in without reservations and it happened to be prom night, but we were seated ASAP in the front section which was just lovely.  Our server, Jen, and her assistant, \""""El Magnifico\"""" were so friendly, super attentive, even though they could have been all stressed about the big groups of prom kids in the main section.  No sweat, just another night for them.  Just loved the service.  Be sure to check in on Yelp and show them the 10% off coupon.  Free amaretto at end of meal.  \n\nI guess I should talk about the food.  It was our first visit so we played it safe, but the basics were good enough to plan for a return.  My spaghetti/marinara/sausage  (which was recommended by Jen when I told her I just needed to try the red sauce on my first visit)  was perfectly fine.  Hubby had stuffed peppers and we both loved them.  \n\nWe like going to local places that are a bit more \""""fancy,\"""" and after being completely disgusted by Belfiore, we were extremely relieved to have our faith restored in nice Italian restaurants by visiting Roma Garden. Spinato's is closer to us but this place is more fitting for \""""date night.\""""  The place just simply made us happy;  please go here and support them!",1
"So we got duped by all the rave reviews for this restaurant. First we get escorted to a tiny little table that was practically like sitting with the people at the next table. We asked to sit at the many empty tables for four. Were told no as they all had reservations. The waiter must have noticed the perplexed expression on my face because he came back after we sat and told us that a reservation had cancelled and offered us one of those tables...So points for that...Side note, all those tables were empty for the entire time we were there.\n\nI ordered the Chicken with prosciutto...I promise you that what I got was chicken with some sort of thick slab of very salty pork product that was not prosciutto, accompanied by the limpest over done pasta I've ever had..The noodles broke in the fork because they were so water logged and soggy. Also served with a basic marinara sauce that in no way complimented the lemon wine sauce on the chicken. My husband ordered the special..seafood risotto. Plenty of seafood, but we're still trying to decide if it was really risotto or some undercooked rice..There was none of the creaminess associated with well prepared risotto.\n\nAfter that we decided to go for broke and order the tiramisu..You can get better at your basic supermarket bakery.\n\nThe service was very good as the waiter and busser were very attentive..",0
"I have been on Yelp for over a year and am always the person to read everyone else's reviews, but never leave my own.  Well, Roma Garden has changed that!!  I want THE WHOLE WORLD to know how amazing their food, service and restaurant is.  My husband and I went there to celebrate date night as well as my 30th birthday.  We were lucky enough to have Jenn as our waitress and she was AMAZING!!  Never once did we feel rushed or pressured and she was always there to explain our options and answer all of our questions . \n\nWe took our time and just enjoyed the surroundings.  We started our meal with the stuffed clams which were delicious.  And the Marsala wine sauce on top was like a heavenly gravy.  The complimentary bread and herb butter was the perfect accompaniment to my moscato.  Pedro (the magnifico) was always there to fill our waters, bring more bread and was so helpful without us having to ask for a single thing.  \n\nNow on to our meals....I ordered the seafood pasta (which wasn't even on the menu but they made it for me!).  It was a full lobster tail, calamari, mussels, clams, prawns (giant) over a bed of fettuccine and pink/vodka sauce!!! It was heavenly!!!  \n\nMy husband ordered one of the evening's specials...the seafood risotto which had all of the same seafood as my pasta but it was over a bed of risotto with a homemade marinara sauce!  Needless to say....it was the best meal we have ever had!!  Not only was the food amazing, but the service was the best we have ever had.  \n\nAnd to top it all off, the prices were more than reasonable.  We have been to five start restaurants, and this food was hands down ten times better.  We will be coming back here for EVERY date night and will bring as many people as possible with us!!  Thank you Roma Garden, Jenn and Pedro (the magnifico) for making my 30th birthday over the top special!!",1
"THANK YOU! \nFinally WONDERFUL Italian food ... Yumm & double yumm!!!\n\nThat was last year.  And it was true. Wonderful warm welcoming feeling, wonderful food, wonderful service. And very understanding and cooperative toward my wife, who is blind. Even to the point of standing on a chair to direct and adjust the available light to best serve my wife. \nAll in all quite impressive and worth the 5 * I gave it. \n\nBut that was last year.  I don't know what happened, maybe they were sold, but this year was entirely different. No warm vibe, no welcoming feeling, totally empty, music and tv blaring, some staff person sitting at the bar texting, waiter says: this is the best lit table (it was pretty dark), I request the table were the guy adjusted the lights, he say I can't do that and it never happened, no one would do such a thing. And the woman at the bar chirps in that I don't know what I'm talking about.\nNasty nasty nasty - especially to a blind person. \nI wouldn't put anything in my mouth made in that hostile place. Stay away!",0
"This place was very disappointing. Walked in on Mother's Day with a party of 4 adults and my one year old son. The waiter seemed annoyed and acted like there was no where for is to sit and he would have to \""""figure something out\"""" when I could see two large tables open. Not only that, I realize it's a small restaurant but they only had two highchairs and both were In use so we had to spend our whole time there over two hours passing my son around to hold him and feed him on my lap. Service took forever 10+ min for drinks 30+ min for food. Very limited menu and food was ok. Small sad portions for the price.",0
"I only just recently discovered this restaurant and enjoyed it so much I have eaten at Roma Gardens three times in a week and a half.  That said,  yesterday ordered from the early bird menu at 5pm and requested the order for carry out. I was charged regular dinner prices., which about twice as much. When I asked, I was told that the early bird prices do not apply to carry-out,  although it is not indicated on the web site or menu. Felt a bit ripped off.  The Phoenix/Scottsdale area is full of good restaurants so probably will not be in a hurry ro return to Roma Gardens.",0
"Excellent local, family owned restaurant. The servers are polite, lovely decor and excellent Italian food. The recipes have been around for years and have been consistently delicious and authentic. Serving sizes are huge so go very hungry or be prepared to take home the extras. Warm, fresh bread with awesome herb butter. Good wine selection, nice happy hour and if you want to go in the late afternoon there's a half off early bird special. Don't let the strip mall location fool you, it's so worth going inside for a nice evening",1
"Our waitress was lovely and the atmosphere inside is nice but that's where my positive comments end.  The cuisine is just pretty bad.  The tomato sauce is thick and pasty.  The vegetables have way too much garlic and the bottom line is that there isn't much talent in the kitchen.  Honestly, if this is what viewers consider good Italian cuisine they are very inexperienced diners of Italian food.  If you want to try real Italian food go to Andreoli's and for pizza go to Pomo.  I wish these people well here but we won't be back.",0
The salad was excellent.  The bread and butter was incredible.  I thoroughly enjoyed the main entree of fettucini Alfredo.  It was obviously made from scratch and tasted so good!  Dont let the location fool you. What a great find.,1
"Delicious, fresh pasta and a complementary glass of amaretto to finish the meal. Perfect evening with great service, we will be back!",1
"Had lunch at this location for the first time this week. I had been to the other location in Scottsdale, (Indian School rd.) many times, with mixed, yet overall favorable reviews. While it must be stated that this isn't going to satisfy the Mexican food connoisseur, I found this place to be pretty enjoyable, and a good value to boot! I had a machaca burrito, enchilada style for $7.50, and it was HUGE! Came with the standard rice and beans and small salad. Wifey had an enchilada plate, also the same price, and she couldn't finish half of it! Very colorful place, clean, and great service. Nice place for small groups and families. Pleasantly surprised!",1
"We first tried this place late last year, it's right down the street from our condo and we were itching to break away from the norm and try a new place.\n\nI am always thinking I might find the next \""""it\"""" place that no one else has discovered. I know Julio's has been around for awhile but I had never heard anything good/bad about it.\n\nIt probably didn't help the start to our dining expierience that an ex-manager/co-worker came into the dining area when were first sat down. Let's just say I pretty much disagreed with this person on every aspect of life and leave it at that. \n\nService was slow, very slow. It was a lazy Sunday and place was not even half full. They finally brought the meal and it was wrong, we waited another 20-25 min and I think part of it was wrong again. I don't even remember what we got it was so forgettable. Just blah, it provided some calories and nothing more. Everything was just bland an so-so. \n\nI gave them 2 stars instead of one because they did comp our entire bill. I felt somewhat bad for the waiter so I left him a big tip and got out of there, so much for trying a new place.",0
"Andy C. really hit the nail on the head. Salsa here sucked, and the beans ARE bland. I also came here in high hope that I'd find some good Guacamole, which was not the case. \n\nStrolled in here last night around 7:30 after being released from the hospital. My sister and I were starving and figured Mexican might be the fix we need.  I forgot how small it is, making the restaurant seem crowded all the time. However, we were seated promptly. Service was okay, but I felt like they were rushing me out of the place. Not appealing. In terms of food, I got a huge Chicken Chimi, which as although good, gave me terrible heartburn which I still have faint traces of. :(\n\nSo-so restaurant. Always has been, always will be.",0
"Awesome place!  For a local neighborhood Mexican restaurant, Julio G's can't be beat!  The service is always consistent and good.  The staff is friendly and the food comes out WAY fast, which is good because then you don't have time to eat too many chips.  The have changed ownership in the last year or so and with that came some improvements.  I'm not sure where they are purchasing their meats but it has definitely improved.  The chicken especially.  I love the combo platter in the middle of the menu.  You can pick and choose and try out different items all served with rice and beans.  The green chile tamale is a favorite as are the fajitas and the Tijuana tacos!  The leftovers actually taste good too.",1
Well I opted for the cheeseburger plate with fris and salad for $8.50 that was suppose to have montery jack but was delivered with yellow (American I think) cheese.  Same for the other burger at our table and the beef burrito a la cart at our table looked dry and was I was told.\n\nThis was my first visit and we came for lunch and sat on the patio.\nThe chips and salsa were good. The softdrinks are big and you get refills which is good since they are $2.35 each!\n\nBut looking at the other plates with mexican food it looked good and smelled wonderful! The staff was reasonaly nice.  \n\nThey have a small bar but the special drinks are HIGH at $7 & $8!\n\nIt was a pricey lunch with tip I spent $14. \n\nStill I might try a mexican meal one day because it smells so good!,0
"I have been to this place a few times because friends were already there and talked me into meeting them there. I have never really thought much of the food but it was not bad enough to write a review about. How bad can you mess up mexican food? But recently I dined at Julio G's and the experience was enough to inspire me to share.  First of all the decor has always bothered me there.  Pink Neon reminds me of some 50's diner.   I always expect to see a Milk Shake on the Menu when I sit down.  Also on this must recent visit I had really poor service. It was only slightly busy but it took an inordinate about of time to get a simple combo dish out.  \n\nThey thing that stuck me most about Julio G's was how expensive it was.  Nothing on the menu was less then $11 for a combo dish.  Actually I think a 2 item combo was like $10.95 and a 3 Item was like $11.95.  Man, $12 bucks for some marginal Mexican Food? I realize prices have gone up on food and produce.  I am sort of expecting to see some price increases across the board at some of my favorite spots.  But this was what I consider to be way out of line with the quality of food, service and overall dining experience.",0
"As others have pointed out, the salsa is terrible.  I got creative and utilized my inner chef using ingredients available at the table, such as salt, lime wedges, and different types of salsa they brought me.  Despite my trying to \""""improve\"""" the salsa, I failed.  I don't think there was anything that could make that quasi pizza sauce better.\n\nBecause I was then so desperate for decent salsa, I was conned into thinking I could order the \""""diablo\"""" salsa which would be an upgrade, and it wasn't.  \n\nI felt disgusted with myself for eating over 1,500 calories, especially on such bad mexican food.  For what it's worth though, my girlfriend's tijuana tacos were decent, but not great.\n\nIt's also expensive for the crummy food (think Chevy's), and like others have pointed out, you feel like you're at Cafe 50's minus the blue plate special.  The lighting was tres obnoxious.  \n\nOne flauta for over $5?  C'mon.\n\nNever again.  You'll be more satsified at Filibertos.",0
"I have been a customer for over 12 years, but the place has been on the downhill slide for years.  They closed the location on indian school years ago, for the same reasons.  Those reasons are many now. I stopped back in after being away from Julio G's Take out.  Had 2 beef tacos and rice....  The rice is very plain and has gotten more gringo over the years  which equals bland.  The taco's had a nice shredded beef filling and was better than 2 years ago.  But the salsa bar has been reduced to salsa given out on plastic topped cups.  Bad news is you have to ask for more all the time if you like the sauce, the hot is far from hot any gringo can use it.  Bad news one person taking orders during lunch service in take out and service said orders.  Cleanup needs to be focused on here... They have forgotten to do this.  Yes, a long term customer is seeing another location in slow spiral down the drain.",0
I am typically a pretty understanding customer and realize that with anything mistakes on orders can happen.  Last night I placed a take out order and ordered the super nachos and only wanted beans cheese and sour cream.  I have gotten this order once a week for the last month and never and I do mean never have they ever put green chillis in the cheese.  \n\nAfter getting home last night when I found that the order had the chillis I asked them to correct it.  The cashier was accomadating but the owner was very rude to my wife and I and lied to ou faces saying that is what they always do.  I informed him of how often we come to his business and he still did not show any concern for us. I WILL NOT BE RETURNING their and they lost a customer for life.,0
Big fan of their salsa.  The Pollo Diablito is my favorite here.,1
"I had the Pollo Diablo, formerly named Pollo Magnifico.  They renamed it because they added more cream cheese, so calling it Diablo would give it that extra edge.  Apparently this burro wasn't enough of an artery clogger just yet.  I didn't know what to get so I decided to get what the Yelp review highlights recommended.  Unfortunately it is not always clear if those highlights are for a positive or negative review of the dish. My quick scan indicated that Pollo Magnifico/Diablo was a good thing, so I went with that.  \n\nPollo Diablo is a deep-fried chicken burro drowning in jalapeno cream and cheese, served with a side of beans and rice.  I took one look at the thing and felt myself getting full and bloated already.  The fried touch made it not quite crispy, just a little greasy.  The inside was tender but hard to really pay attention to with all of the jalapeno cream and cheddar cheese everywhere. I was overwhelmed and ate less than half the entree.  Nothing worth taking with me, either.\n\nThe worst part about eating here is that we all just got tired from eating.  They are big, heavy portions.  I looked over at my cousin and his head was propped up in his hands, his eyes drooping.  My sister's tamale was basically a hunk of really heavy and dry cornbread and she was exhausted from eating, too.  This was heavy stuff.\n\nI'm not from the Southwest so maybe I just don't know any better, but for this California girl, I would much rather  eat Mexican food in a dirty hole in the wall in San Jose than to come back here.",0
Love this place!!! The service is great and the food is delicious!! I have yet to try something I do not like.,1
"This must be the place that seasonings forgot...\nI came here last night with two others. I had been there before but it had been years  and I don't recall anything about that experience.This trip however was just as the rating implies: \""""Meh. I've experienced better.\""""\nOur server was friendly, but not personable. Some people just aren't, and that's ok. The chips and salsa were great, I really enjoyed them. I wish their spicy salsa was spicier though. We started with an order of chips and guacamole. I don't think anything was added to the avocado. Maybe some diced up tomato? I could be wrong, but it really just tasted like mashed up avocado and a slight touch of lemon maybe? Probably more to keep it from turning brown, than for flavor. But there was no, or at least very little, salt and pepper.\nOur entrees came out shortly after and it was the same story. Everything looked delicious, but was really lacking in flavor. I had the nachos with ground beef which I would usually love anywhere else but was very unimpressed. \nThis was just \""""meh\"""",",0
"Understaffed is never a good thing for a restaurant. Empty dirty tables and a 20 minute wait. So we asked to sit in the bar area while we waited. No service. No bartender to even get a beer while u wait! Still, starving we went to the take out side of the place and we had a generous portion of mediocre typical Mexican food. Bland flavors and no salsas on the salsa bar. Staff that showed up to work today seemed nice.",0
"Service with Christopher was great, food was good! Salsa is too sweet and the fried ice cream wasn't freshly fried. Some minor changes would make this a great little place!!",1
"We live near Julio G's, so we go there about once a month. We've never had a bad meal, and the service has always been above average!  I highly recommend the cactus margarita! I always end up taking home half my dinner because the portions are big and we eat way too many chips and salsa before the food comes!",1
My husband and I always enjoy eating at Julio G's. The queso dip is the best.  And our absolute favorite is the Pollo Diablo fried extra crispy!  We love taking people here who are visiting from out of town and so far everyone loves it.\n\nThe restuarant stays busy with customers and I have never had to wait for a table.  I always enjoy my servers.  They always polite and informative.  Keep up the great work!,1
"The chips and salsa are fantastic...that's what keeps bringing us back.  This is my one year olds favorite restaurant as she loves the salsa.  The food is pretty good...I have to admit it's not the best Mexican food I've ever had, but it's always consistently good.",1
The first time we used Davis they were fine.  I think they may have been sold after that because the last time we used them they were pretty bad.  They broke several items and made the process to get repairs done impossible.  The lady there was very curt and obnoxious.  We had items in storage that were delivered uncovered and filthy.  I would not recommend them at all.,0
"This place is so close to home and I love Einstein Bros Bagels, just not this one.  The place feels cramped and dirty.  Too bad because I would go here more often if those two things weren't an issue, I guess I could eat outside but I want the choice.  When we ate here the server got our order wrong twice once on the the receipt then when it was made; how does that happen? Oh well, maybe I will visit here again just to see if it improves or maybe I will just have to drive a little further.",0
"Stopped in for a  Bagel-Dog. They had only one on the shelf. Looked as if it had been pre-cooked once or twice. After asking if there were any others, I was told, \""""Nope. That's it.\""""\nSo I left it and walked out. So much for my Bagel-Dog.\nIt will be a long time before I go into that place again.",0
get the spinach florentine bagel with jalopeno cream cheese! very yummy!,1
The workers were extremely friendly and the bagels were amazing. All you can drink coffee?YES! I wish we had one of these in California and next time I go to Arizona I will make it a top priority to come back.,1
"If you think these are good bagels, you've never had a good bagel.  I wouldn't even call what they serve bagels.  Unfortunately, where I work they bring these in for various occasions so I'm guessing they're cheap.\n\nIf you're from NY/NJ area don't waste your time or money - you'll be chucking this in the trash after one bite.\n\nDisgusting.",0
"Taste like nasty rye bread bagels. Have had way better, but then again I'm from the East Coast. Go to Dunkin Donuts they're better for a chain that makes bagels.",0
"This is the second morning I have come to this particular location.  I have now been late to work for the past 2 days.  It was not due to the store being busy, it was a complete lack of organization and employees did not move w a purpose.  On both occasions, the cashier was wondering aimlessly while 5+ customers waited in line. The frustration and lack of service that the other patrons and I felt, could have been avoided if the employees had been focused.  I will sadly not return to this location, even though it is on the way to my office.",0
Bagels are good. Waited about 5 minutes before they started my cappuccino. 10 minutes after that when it was still an empty cup I told them nevermind and left. This location seems to do an ok job with 3 or fewer people in line. The one at Desert Ridge does better with rushes .,0
"This is the worst customer service I have ever had to deal with. The staff has zero communication therefor multiple orders were wrong, and took over 20 minutes to get out. I personally witnessed employees despite wearing gloves touching their hair, and dropped milk caps on the floor and continued to put it on the milk jug. If I was a health inspector they definitely would not have passed. It just seems to have gotten sloppy and disappointing.\n\nNot to mention I've been sitting typing this review, I open my bagel and the cream cheese and butter I paid for aren't on here.... Who eats bagels just toasted?",0
"Staff (besides assistant manager) is completely incompetent. The last few times I've been there, I have waited an absurd amount of time either to pay for my food, or receive my food. Not because there was a long line, just because the person who was supposed to do it was distracted doing something else. One time the cashier took a 5 min long phone order instead of helping me (which would've taken 30 seconds), dropped the phone, then started doing drink orders! Never even came back to the register or apologized for the wait. I could've ran out with my bagel without paying!  There are some serious communication issues at that store, and the staff needs some serious re-training. Plus it's safe to say I'm never coming back here again. Which is a shame, because it is so much closer to my house, and I love their bagels. Get it together!",0
"Bagels:  always stick with the pumpernickel and everything bagels. Their lite cream cheese is very good. \nThe service person at the register is a CONSTANT bottleneck. I completely agree with the other reviewers who leveled similar complaints. The woman treats the cash register as if she is performing DNA analysis.\nI never ask these folks for any bagel preparation whatsoever. I simply buy a half dozen or dozen box, and then wait for the checkout blunder of the day. Today, she gave my bag of bagels to another customer and again could not properly manage checkout for either customer. \nIf you do want better service, go to the einsteins on 64th street and greenway.",0
The bagels are good. The sandwiches leave something to be desired in the taste department and the coffee is over roasted. Everything is a bit over-priced for what you get. I have never had a problem with the customer service.,0
"I get the same exact sandwich every time, but about half of the time they get my order wrong!!!  It's annoying...they either give me the wrong bagel or don't give me double egg white (which they charge me for) or put cheese when I ask for no cheese....it's not rocket science people!  lol  So I stopped going here even though it's the closest to me",0
"Loyal customer for many years.  I love this place, although the chemical smell is overwhelming like most dry cleaners.  I like to get in and out of there.  Pricing is great and I never have any issues.",1
This place has been here forever and does a great job.  their prices are more reasonable than anyone else in the area and the staff has always been polite and professional.   I highly recommend it,1
"What can make a long and frustrating day better (other than a lot of liquor)?  Treating yourself to a mani/pedi!  Not knowing where to go, I simply selected the first place I saw on my route home that looked open.  Lucky me - I ended up at Paradise Nails!  I knew I was in the right place when I came in the door - they use quality Opi products and the salon is very clean.  The pedicure was one of the best I have ever had, complete with a nice long relaxing foot/leg massage.  I walked in tired and cranky, and walked out feeling like a million bucks (for only $31 + tip)!  I will definitely be back!!",1
"Before nursing school, I used to have pampered nails. Now I bite them before tests, break them opening pill bottles, and hold the polish as a means of infection control.\n\nThe minute my semester was over, I went for a mani/pedi. I feel ASLEEP in the massage chair. (Thankfully it was later in the day and not that many people were there to witness this)\n\nSo, I've been coming to see Mei here at Paradise Nails off and on for around 5 years. She just went ahead and let me sleep, she figured I needed it. I figure they need 5 stars.\n\nOh, and you'd never know I'm in nursing by looking at my hands now. Bam!",1
"This is long, the moral of the story is skip this place for sure, and go somewhere-anywhere-else. \n\nMy sister goes to this place every once in a while for a polish change, so when I was thinking about getting a manicure for myself I decided to come here. I never get my nails done because I can rarely afford it, so this was supposed to be a nice treat. \n\nI walked in and was greeted and I was told they could take me immediately. So I quickly chose my polish colors (I was in a bit of a hurry) and waited for them to seat me. It took about 10 minutes for someone to take me to a station. I told my nail technician that I only had about a half hour for the manicure, and she said that would be no problem.\n\n An hour later they told me that my nails were dry and I was ready to go. Since it took twice as long as they originally said, I had to rush home and change for an event. After changing, I got in my car and glanced down at my nails, only to see that each one was smudged, some nails had the polished completely wiped off. \n\nFrustrated, the next day I went in to have the polish re-done. One of the women who works there, an older lady, glanced at my nails and said that she didn't see anything wrong with them. Then when I pointed out all of the smudges, I was told that they were \""""too busy\"""" and to come back in an hour. Well, they closed in less than an hour. I went to run one errand and came back about a half an hour and the same woman (the older lady) was rude again to me. I asked to speak with the owner, who I stepped outside with and explained my situation. \nShe apologetically took me back in the store and set me up with my nail technician from the day before. This time she did a shellack manicure since it dries faster. When it came time for the top coat, the owner came over to do it her self. She snidely remarked that I was too impatient the day before and left before it was dry, which is not true. The fact that she had the nerve to say anything to me after the way I was treated the first two times was shocking. After my shellack dried, I left. \n\nThe shellack manicure lasted 3 days, even with good upkeep (I put a clear coat on it and I am never very hard on my nails). \n\nMoral of the story, this is a horrible place to have your nails done. Skip this place and go somewhere with better service!!",0
"I've been coming to Paradise Nails since it has opened. I get my eyebrows done here regularly and what a fantastic job. I've never had an issue. Sometimes the wait is a little long, and their prices have gone up a bit for other services, but I will continue to come here for my eyebrows.",1
Just don't buy any gift certificates at this place.  I went there for about 7 years.  Each year my husband would buy 12 gift certificates.  Sometimes I would not get there every month and that was fine with the previous owner if I went over the expiration date.  Not so with new owner.  Older lady that works there came running out after me and I have never been back!!  Even wrote the owner a letter which was never acknowledged.  They lost me as a customer plus my daughter and granddaughter. Too many other great places who want me to keep coming back.,0
"Won't go back. Horrible customer service. Made an appointment with friends. They took a walk-in after we had checked in for our appointment. Two of the three of us got pedicures, while one waited.  Rude.",0
I've been here several times and they always do a good job.  It's really close to where I live and I like that.  Definitely recommend this place.  I've only had the guy that sits at the front do my nails so I don't know about the rest of the staff but he's great.,1
"This is my favorite nail salon in Phoenix.  I can't say enough good things about them.  They are great at customer service, all of their techs do a great job, and they are less expensive than any other place I've been to in 10 years.  If they aren't busy, one tech will do your mani while another does your pedi and you are in and out of there in no time.  The owner is really nice, too.  I was even in a pinch once and they let my two year old daughter run around while a got a quick manicure.  I'm a regular.",1
"2/2/11- Talk about going downhill! Dunno know if it is a new mgr or what but when I get a roll with my salad and the bottom half is covered in black mold...EEK! \n\nThis little stuck-in-the-seventies place is the restaurant at the Belair Golf Course off of Bell Rd. Its really somewhat of a hidden gem though if you're looking for regular ol' American food. Its quiet, has a lovely view of the lake, peaceful, good service and above average food. The breakfast is especially good with the chicken fried steak being my personal favorite. Its actually real steak not some pre-breaded b.s. I like the club sandwich for lunch- generous amounts of meat, fresh lettuce & tomato, hot fries- how can you go wrong? My only reason for not giving it another star would be the decor. Its perfectly fine, I guess. It's clean. Its just so seventies. But, hey, go there to relax with friends, get a drink from the bar and soak up the seventies charm.",0
"Got a burger here and opted for the onion rings instead of french fries.  Once the food arrived, after a considerable wait and empty water glasses, I instantly regretted my decision.  The onion rings were those skinny little fried, non-onion, onion rings that seem to be showing up everywhere lately.  While they are all fine and good on a burger, as a side they are a major disappointment.  The burger was pretty much a McBurger with a bigger bun.  I could have handled the average food if the service wasn't so lackluster.  Go for the golf, don't stay for the food.",0
"Wow.  A new local breakfast gem.  We go to \""""the Place\"""" often and wanted something different.  This is tucked in the BelAir golf community and is the club house for the golf course.   Great food.  The usual suspects (Reuben, burgers, dogs, etc..) but great and local. It's a bit dated inside, but so what?  Go! Go! Go!",1
"When you first enter the restaurant the smell of stale smoke smacks you in the face. The d\u00e9cor is so worn down I do not think it has ever been updated. The view of the greenish/brown pond is the only relief that you get from drab run down dinning room. Our waiter was inattentive and disorganized, we had to ask him multiple times for the same things throughout the meal. Every time we asked him for something it would be 20 minutes before we saw him again. He messed the bill up and it took him 15 minutes to fix it and another 15 minutes to bring change. I ordered the eggs benedict which I thought tasted great. My husband on the other hand ordered the chicken fried steak skillet which was burnt and extremely chewy. Overall this was a poor experience. The only reason I would go back would be to sit on the patio when the weather is nice and drink a beer!",0
"Came here on 12/16/2013 for a Christmas Party. There was 32 of us at he event. We had three selections to choose from off the menu. Chicken Alfredo, Pork Chops and grilled Salmon. \n\nConsidering there was 32 of us the service we received from  our waitress was absolutely outstanding. She put pitchers of water and ice tea out for us in addition to pots of hot coffee.\n \nMy choice of an entr\u00e9e was the grilled salmon. It was perfectly cooked. Tender flaky and tasty. It came with rolls & butter, A house salad, wild rice and green beans. Everything was delicious. \n\nMy wife ordered the pork chops. They also am grilled. Carol had me try a bite. The pork was succulent. It wasn't dried out and was very tasty. Not at all what I was expecting. The dish came with rolls, apple sauce & broccoli.  \n\nFOOD: Everything was cooked the way it should be. SERVICE: Absolutely superb.  PRICE: Prices were a bit high. AMBIANCE: Nice clean environment. CONCLUSION:  RETURN FACTOR100%. \n  \n    ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ********************\n\n5 stars -Highly recommended.

"I was excited to try for the Friday Night Fish Fry after watching the yelp reviews. Pulled up at 6:30 and a line so it must be the real deal.  Gave my name to the hostess and told maybe a 15 minute wait which was perfect as my son and his friend would not arrive till then. 45 minutes passed and I checked with the hostess as I am noticing a few groups being seated who arrived after me. This time the hostess was not the young girl who took my reservation but an older lady who advised me I had a long wait as I was last on the list and at least 6 groups ahead of me. Some how they must have made a mixup but I would not mind the wait as it must be good. Finally 8:10 pm we are seated and quickly served water and menus. I asked about the fish and was told it was all you can eat Fresh Alaskan Pollack, Cole Slaw and French Fries for $9.95. Alaskan Pollack is not too bad white fish, similar to cod where it's namesake Atlantic Pollack is not the same species and is somewhat a slim white fish with color close to the skin and an off flavor, mostly ground and used in fish sticks and imitation crab. While the fish was cooked nicely and the french fries crisp, the fish was not Alaskan Pollock and had the off taste of its namesake from the Atlantic. Service was scatter brained from the hostess mixup to the server who had the memory of a gnat and took us the last 15 minutes to get our check. Just by the sheer number of guests I think I just hit them on a bad night and maybe their fish provider made a mistake this week. I will head back to the Peoria Cafe for my fish next Friday as it is always good but I can't help myself to try new Friday night fish fry's over the Valley.",0
"Very good food for what the price is. Nice service, very attentive. Elaine was very nice. First time I had fried pollock. The clam chowder was good but could have been hotter. The fries were good but the seasoning I could do without. But overall I was happy with the food. I would come back to try something different.",1
"Update:   DO NOT MOVE HERE.... DO NOT MOVE HERE....     11/9/20211   The apartment management team sometime in the middle of the night put notices on every door telling us put our fire extinguishers outside our doors by 8 AM or we would  be charged $45 for them to enter the apartment on a later date.   What a complete jackass move!!!   SCAM ALERT....SCAM ALERT    They only seem to care about money and trying to scam those who are not going to stand up for themselves against their bullshit tricks and lies.

I get the distinct impression that the current management company had no respect for their customers, the residences.     An example would be the recent notices posted of their legal right to enter your apartment and that they would be entering in the next few days.  They didn't offer any reason why they would be coming into my apartment and on top of that had marked the box indicating that the legal notice had been hand delivered to a resident vs. the box that said it was left on the door and a certified letter had been mailed.  I happened to be awake and the notice was dropped off at 11pm.   Shady people....very shady.   The lack of respect for customers is similar to the experience I had with this property management company at another property. \n\nWe also suspect that the new Management company has sold our information as we have been recently getting more junk mail from strange sources.   We noticed a lot of the same junk in the garbage can so we are thinking they may have sold everyone out.  \n\n   I love the apartments, the balconies and layouts but really dislike the staff.     I have nothing but disdain for the management company Greystar.\n\n\nUpdate:   I have down graded to one stare.   WARNING, DO NOT MOVE HERE....DO NOT MOVE HERE....",0

"While polite people, I must say that it is a complete half job. I purchased this on Groupon, and $200 later (discounted from $350) the \""""dusting\"""" consists of using a feather duster. Everyone in AZ knows that doesn't work, so now I'm $200 poorer and still have dust. Buyer beware -- also, their website says they don't give price ranges, only exact numbers.

Really???? How about 100% of the people who hire a cleaning company just want dust gone, not the method. \n\nAnd yes, we did talk specifically to this owner who tried to shake us down for more money with the same lie - as you can see from the other poster Britny I paid well more than she did.

"Groupon Buyers BEWARE.\n\nAlong with Steve, I am also extremely disappointed in the lack of cleanliness here. I purchased the $75 Groupon (thank GOD I didn't waste anymore than that). When I was contacted they said they would be at my house for one hour, because that was what was included in the Groupon. We have cameras in the house due to a previous untrustworthy cleaning lady and could see that they were here today for 36 minutes total. \n\nDuring those 36 minutes they cleaned: the floors, and dusted an end table. That's it. Not the bathrooms, they didn't even wipe down the counter-tops. The entire house was untouched except the floor and that one end table.\n\nNot only that, but the floors weren't even clean. I took a clean wipe to them when I got home and came up with a dirty, dirty wipe.\n\nI was using this as a test to see if I would use them in the future for bi-weekly cleanings. Needless to say, that won't be happening.

However, due to the lack of professionalism the first time around, and the outrageous pricing without a coupon I will not use them again.",0
"I've never used a housekeeping service before, and always thought it was silly and wasteful to pay someone else to clean up my family's mess.  However, after having a baby and some surgery and moving into a new house I decided to splurge on a groupon for this service.  My husband was here when the crew came and says they were friendly and efficient and gave the full amount of service that we paid for.  When I came home, I was relieved to see my home looking so much better.  I appreciate the work they did and they took a big load off of my shoulders.  Thanks!",1
"I have used A To Z Housekeeping a couple of times and have always been happy with the results. I appreciate the professionalism and excellent customer service: appointments are routinely confirmed, and you will receive a call when the crew is on the way. The cleaning is not entirely perfect (there are some cut corners, such as parts of my rugs that didn't get vacuumed), but overall, the house is clean after they have been working for an hour (and I'm pretty discerning...). The ladies are nice and cheery, and they do get quite a bit done. This is my favorite cleaning service: others I've used just don't feel right. This one does.",1
I can't say I've experienced better but I can't give it an A-OK. \nMy dad had a partial knee replacement and wasn't ready to go home from the hosiptal so my mom and I chose this place. The rehab part of it was fine. The staff were freindly but often left him on the side of the bed and no way to call the nurse. The food was terrible. They would say there was soup before dinner every night but only brought it once.  It seemed a bit disorganized- new people didn't know what to do and had to ask a million questions.The billing was the worst part. :Luckily my mom kept track of everything that they were supposed to pay and every time she got an incorrect bill she would have to call. This happened twice so the third time she went up there in person to speak to them and hopefully got it all resolved.,0
"This place was awful , I was there for rehab  the therpists were ok ,there were some awesome Cna's  the food service was really bad no selection and tasted like shit. I wouldnot recommend this place to anyone!",0
"Their is nothing lower than one star or even negative. \n\nWhere to start? \nFOOD- NOT GOOD, the staff specially Miriam is SUPER NICE(GO TO THE DINNING ROOM, FIRST FLOOR)\nCLEANLINESS-Over the surface cleaning and the common areas, usually the first floor. Cover your nose if you go to the  second floor!\nCARE-2 girls (TOTALLY WORTH IT) out of at least 30 i have met. HORRID ODDS not to mention that they have 15-25 patients to 1 nurse. And they split patients from one wing to another on the other wing of the building. WHAT? Really! When I ask how my dad is doing; NO ONE KNOWS! It's usually a I just got here, or a plain \""""I don't know\"""". Don't they have charts? \nBATHS- Dogs gets better and more loving baths, I SAW it since I was in the bathroom/bath area. \nINJURIES: Just NEVER heals, goo on top of goo. \nACTIVITIES: I gotta give it to the lady in charge of that she does A TON if the residents want to join. \nOVERALL:\nThink about how you would want you mom or dad to be taken care off. And if you are a selfish person and you don't care about your parents. KARMA IS A B#&^!(@ So good luck when you get old! \nI sure know why I am not a Doctor, Economist, Mechanic, Arquitect to name a few... it's cause I SUCK! \nWhy choose to be in a field like this if you are not CUT for it? I am sure you can go somewhere else and make $10 an/hr! \nLooking for a different location currently! WHAT A SHAME this PLACE is OVERALL. \nThe 4 people i have met are not enough to make this location worth while anyones time! \nIf you want to get back at your parents, or a friend PUT them here! \nThey might keep them alive... BUT that's about it! Most of the people here are not terminal! They are just old, and have no one to look after them around the clock. They are here to have someone help them with basic needs and maybe show a bit of love while they are here.",0
"My family has been going to Cathedral for all of their automotive needs for a few years, faithfully. But after hearing how they bilked my Mom today, none of us will be going back. After she had her 30,000 mile service yesterday ($235.00) she noticed that her A/C was not working when she left. She called Cathedral and they told her to bring the car back in. So, today she brought it in and was told that there is a hole in the A/C hose. She explained that it was working fine when she brought the car in and did not understand why this had happened. Should't testing the A/C be part of the service? Or maybe they could have told her that she was low on freon? Or that the hose was bad? NO, the guy told her that this was a common thing with her make of car. They told her that it would be $150.00 for the part.  That $150.00 turned into $313.00 when they were done and now my Mom who is 75 and on Social Security will have to do without, because these guys f'd up. Thanks Cathedral...for ripping off a old lady. PS-my mom is no longer a customer, not sure where you pulled that from. Nice try though.",0
"I've been taking mine and my family's cars to Cathedral for more than a decade. We are always treated fairly, and always have a good experience - the guys always stand by their work and \""""go the extra mile\"""" to be sure our cars are fixed properly. They work on both our new(er) cars and my cars from the 50s and 60s. \n\nWhenever anyone is looking for a mechanic, I will send them here without fail - and John and the guys at Cathedral have always come through by totally taking care of anyone I send to them. In a business filled with some sketchy practices, I know that whether I send my wife, a friend, or a coworker to Cathedral they will be treated honestly and fairly. Cars break and break down, that's a fact of owning one. I'm glad I have Cathedral to make dealing with it so easy and stress free so I can get back on the road as quickly and cheaply as possible.",1

"What can I say, Rubio's rocks.  I can go to almost any of them and they are very graceful and accommodating to my diet needs.  This one is on the way to my kids old school, so I could stop here and get some to go items.  The manager and employees are very nice.",1
I was craving a fish taco and this place was exactly what I was looking for! The tacos were creative and fresh. I loooooved the soy ginger fish taco. I would definitely come back again!,1
"Ok, so we know it's a chain and have seen plenty of locations everywhere. I'm giving a full 4 stars for this location because of the manager on duty the day I visited. The employees were all kept busy and the orderliness of the place showed that. I was hesitant to try the fish tacos because I'm just getting into fish (kinda) and usually chicken-out, literally, when it comes to tacos! But, the manager was so friendly and helpful and descriptive of what I would find when I tried the special, that I couldn't resist. Glad I couldn't! Delish, even for being \""""slightly fishy\"""", and a nice spicy flavor with the mango salsa relish stuff!",1
I don't see the big deal about this place! Food it ok. A little over price for what you get!,0
"I was pleasantly surprised by this location. I wouldn't call Rubio's \""""authentic\"""" by any means but if you are looking for a quick fix for your taco cravings it will do the trick.\n\nThe food is pretty good. I adore their poblano and mushroom tacos. Not many places serve veggie tacos so this makes me happy. These tacos are stuffed with grilled poblanos, portabellas, fresh avocado, cilantro, and queso fresco. Plus the taco shell has cheese crisped on to it. It is a surprising and tasty twist. \n\nI have always liked their beans and before I discovered their tacos I would get a plain old bean burrito.\n\nMy husband always gets fish tacos or burritos and always says they are good.\n\nTheir salsa isn't the best but they have a few different kind of varieties.\n\nPortion sizes are kinda flimsy especially their side items...\n\nService at this location is awesome! The lady running the register is sooooo nice and seems extremely competent.  \n\nThey also sell beer which is nice for a fast food establishment. I haven't imbibed yet because I always order takeout but I saw a sign that said all beer is $2.50 in the evenings. Hmmmm... I might have to come back for that.\n\nGive Rubio's a chance- they might surprise you.",1
"I'm typically a fan of Rubio's.  I've been to many of their locations.  However, this one disappointed.  I ordered:\n\nSteak Burrito Especial, $6.99\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rubios-fresh-mexican-grill-phoenix-5?select=ZOzRhgzHjp_MipYqG2Kn6A#ZOzRhgzHjp_MipYqG2Kn6A\n\nSteak Street Taco, $1.89\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rubios-fresh-mexican-grill-phoenix-5?select=4KJ_NtL5G2EXKqIca2zehA#4KJ_NtL5G2EXKqIca2zehA\n\nThe food came out in a short time.  While I was waiting, I went to the Salsa Bar to grab a few cups of their spicy Salsa.  The first item I ate was the Steak Street Taco....the meat was dry and Guacamole was bland.  I poured a lot of the Salsa on it to add flavor and give it some moisture.  Very disappointing.\n\nNext, I had the Burrito.  That was dry too!  Even with the Sour Cream in the Burrito, it was dry...the Steak, Rice, Beans...all was dry.  Needless to say, I used a heavy dose of Salso on that as well.  To make it worse, the Chips that came with the Burrito were 1/2 fresh & crispy and 1/2 were covered in oil or stale...so they were chewy...that means they combined new, fresh Chips with a batch of old ones....bummer.\n\nOne positive thing is that the service here was outstanding.  The cashier was very friendly and had a nice, welcoming smile.  I also watched a customer complain that one of the sodas was out of syrup on the machine....the employee sincerely apologized and quickly remedied the situation by replacing the empty container with a new one.\n\nI'll have to come back and give this place another try, it may have been an off day for them.\n\nReturn Factor - 60%",0
"We had family in town and I didn't want to cook. I get tired of pizza or subs for larger groups (10 of us) and wanted something fairly healthy. I thought of Rubio's and wasn't disappointed! Everything was ready on time, and our burritos and salad were delicious. I'll definitely use Rubio's again for my catering needs.",1
Been going to Rubios since they first appeared in the valley! This location is especially consistent in quality food and service.  Love the fish tacos and their selection has really grown!  Yummy.,1
"I have been waiting on a to go order for about 45 minutes.,... Still waiting..\n\nThis is not my first experience at this rubios. Last time I was here and found a hair in my food so I stopped eating it. Later that night I found myself throwing up over the toilet for about 6 hours\n\nNEVER COME TO THIS RESTAURANT",0
Never eat here. They got my order wrong and put some spicy sauce on my taco that made me throw up.,0
"This was the first time I came here and it was OK. \n\nThe chicken was flavorful but the salsa were definitely lacking. \n\nAlso, kind of on the expensive side considering it's a \"""" fast causal\"""" type place.",0
I absolutely love Rubios but this location is having some serious issues. The staff isn't very pleasant or efficient at all. Dining in is a mistake because that place is not clean. It is hard to enjoy the food when everywhere you look needs a clean up. I wish management would notice the issues and make the necessary changes. The prices are not cheap so it would be nice to have some more quality in the experience.,0
"Such a great little place. We can argue for days about Authentic or not....Who cares? \nThe Food is fresh and yummy! Not too much salt or grease and everything seems to be made to order. \nI went for the Coastal Trio which was Fish Taco, Shrimp Taco, Tilapia Taco! All were great and loaded with fresh ingredients. If I had to nit-pick the tortilla could've been a little softer, but it held together great! \nSalsa bar was amazing with something for everyone. I think 6-7 types to choose from. \nThis is a very nice place that I will certainly visit again! \nIf you like Seafood Tacos/Burritos, give this place a try. Don't let the Commercialized Type Presence scare you away, its very good food!",1
30 minutes to make 4 fish tacos and they screwed up the order.  Never again.,0
"Good prices, delicious tacos, and a salsa bar, what more could you want?\n\nKeep in mind this is a quick service Mexican restaurant (order at the counter and seat yourself), but that doesn't degrade the food quality. Great for lunch or a quick, casual dinner.  Classic tacos with any of the meat options are a win!",1
"First off let me say that up until tonight I was a huge fan of Rubios. I would always order their grilled shrimp tacos or bean and cheese burrito. It always tasted fresh and wasn't greasy. However, tonight I decided to try their new California bowl. I was expecting it to be somewhat similar to Chipolte's burrito bowls. Well . . . the concept was, but in reality it was not even close. The rice was clearly over cooked as it was all mushed together and had no flavor. I assume it is called the California bowl because of the guacamole. However, the amount of guacamole was highly disappointing. Once I mixed all the bowl ingredients together, I couldn't even taste the guacamole which is the best part. I added chicken and again highly disappointed with how much chicken they added. I could barely taste that there was even chicken. Overall, the NEW addition to the menu was a huge disappointment. In the future, Chipolte will be the only place I go for a delicious burrito bowl.\n\nOn a side note, I was also disappointed when Rubio's stopped carrying carnita's. They have two strikes against them in my book.",0
"I am rating this one because I cannot leave feedback with ZERO stars. Do NOT go to see Dr. Erica N. Bigos  (formerly, Erica N. Elannan). I have never had any issues with my teeth. I had a cavity that I got in my 20's. The filing was getting old and I had it redone. About 6 months later I changed dentists to Dr. E bc she is a cosmetic dentist and I was interested in pursuing veneers for my two front teeth, which are mainly composite (from a gap that never closed with braces and from several chips).  After her first visit with me she told me the tooth I just had the filing redone on needed to be crowned because there was a lot of decay. She appeared to be very knowledgeable and I went ahead with her proposed treatment plan.  She's very personable and makes you feel great, like she's the best in the business, don't bother driving to Scottsdale she says, bc she can give you best treatment in Anthem, same lab, cheaper price, and her work is perfection.. so she says. Getting the crown was painful, it did not go without a hitch, and after this experience I would not get veneers in her office. I referred my husband to her for a cleaning bc new patients got free teeth whitening. My husband went and got his teeth cleaned and walked away with a laundry list of items he needed to get done, including more crowns. After getting a second opinion, he did not need the work she recommended, he did not trust her integrity and never went back. After another routine cleaning there, she said I needed another crown on a tooth where I had a filing. Apparently her x-ray showed decay and in her ledger notes she wrote I needed to get it \""""taken care of ASAP or risk a root canal\"""". This concerned me, bc my typical appointments with dentist run very smoothly, aside from the 2-3 cavities I had in my early years. After a second opinion, I was told that was absolutely ridiculous. Then her staff followed up consistently to get it scheduled... so you can make sure you \""""use up all of your insurance by the end of year bc it doesn't roll over.\"""" I got a crown on a tooth that I likely didn't even need. I have had two dentists since, both have confirmed I did not need that second crown she recommended. Three years later, the second tooth she recommended I get crowned hasn't been touched and it's 100% fine, yet I know have major issues with her crown work, as a result I may need an extraction! SEVERAL other residents in Anthem have had similar complaints and lawsuits!........ I will say this, they are aware that I am not happy with my experience there and while I will never step foot in their office again, they offered to rectify the situation. I will be filing a complaint with the AZ Board of Dentistry.....and the other person giving the review, Jamie W. works there.",0
"I hate going to the dentist, but this staff always makes it much easier to go to the dentist. They are all very friendly and professional. Dr. E Bigos  has been my dentist now for six years and she is awesome. They have done my crowns and a root canal and did an excellent job on all occasions. I highly recommend North Valley Family Dentistry and all of their staff.",1
"Very friendly service and so inexpensive for pedicures! My boyfriend and I really enjoyed relaxing here.\n\nThe only negative is that I wish they had a bit more of a selection of nail polishes. Also, they ask that we don't use credit cards.",1
"ehhhhhhh...\nI really wanted to like this place...but I left unimpressed.\n\nMy co worker recommended this place after a few good experiences. I am also crazy about reading reviews online and overall, this place has good reviews so I gave it a shot. \n\nThe shop was in good condition and I really liked that they took their tools out of a sanitized bag. Knowing your tools have been cleaned well is a big plus.\n\nI got a shellac manicure and the younger girl that did my manicure was nice and thorough, however, she put WAY too much polish on. My past shellac manicures have lasted 2-3 weeks but mine started to lift off my nails within 5 days. I am thinking I just got the wrong gal for the job but I think I am going to be sticking with Desert Nail Spa. \n\n$25 for a shellac manicure.",0
My favorite nail salon for pedicures :) they have the best nail polish color selection!,1
"I desperately needed to get my nails done yesterday while in the Kierland neighborhood, so pulled out the Yelp app and found Fancy Nails.  The reviews were spot on...Tony was great - friendly, quick and quality work!  I will definitely be back when I am in the area again and in need of a pedicure or a fill.",1
Love this place. Very large with lots of nail techs.  I've never waited longer than 5 min even without appointment.  They do a fantastic job on nails and toes. They even have little kids pedi chairs...my girls love it there!!,1
"I've been to this place countless times, I've really tried to like it, mainly cause everyone there is so nice! But it's always 50/50! Either it's amazing or it takes 2+hours to do a simple gel manicure. It just seems that their techs need more training. Among other reasons, it's unlikely i will be returning to Fancy Nails.",0
Very relaxing! ! Ask for Tina!!  Massage chairs are awesome and they even have fun chairs for your little princess! !,1
"I had a wonderful experience at Fancy Nails. First of all I walked in about a 1/2 hour til close, but I was desperate and they were open on a Sunday, when my regular nail salon wasn't. So bonus there! They have a great big selection of polishes too. \n\nI got a gel manicure from one of the male nail technicians and he was wonderful. He did such a meticulous job!! I think this polish will stay on for three weeks. It's been nine days and I usually see the start of the polish wearing off/growing out and .... nothin'. I bet I go 16-17 days with this polish on. \n\nHe also gave me some tips about my nails and how I should request that no drills be used to remove my gel polish at all as it burns and pits the nail bed... something I didn't pay much attention to as I thought I was going to a professional before who knew how to take care of nails. Salons that are in a hurry and treat customers like cattle tend to use those drills to get clients in and out fast.\n\nThe salon was very clean and the staff is wonderful. I highly recommend! Great experience and spot on dollar wise... $25 for a gel mani. I'm going to try a pedicure this weekend.",1
"Every time I've been here I've had a different tech do my nails and each time they've turned out amazing!  Plus I love the decor of the place :)  definitely recommend... and the prices are very reasonable, $25 for a gel manicure!",1
"Clean, well appointed nail salon.  However, after several years as a patron, it's no longer my favorite nail salon.  The gel nail polish never ever stayed on the professed  two weeks.  After going to an out-of-town nail salon, where the service was above par and my gel polish stayed on for almost three weeks, I finally realized that Fancy Nails was no longer my favorite nail salon.  There was something wrong with either their application method or the gel polish itself.  \n\nAnother issue that I always had with Fancy Nails was the fact that the owner's son was always lounging or sleeping in one of the pedicure chairs.  Other employees were either smoking out in front or in back (with the door open so the smoke would drift inside).  Nope, it's no longer my favorite nail salon.  However, I do hope they step up their game and clean up the way they do business.",0
"I dont really like giving bad reviews and I actually had to think long and hard about writing thisone. I enjoy the fact that is is a local business and i have taken my dog there several times, mostly as a puppy, I then switched to another groomer, Hugs n Pups.  I stopped going to this place originally because I thought the customer service was poor, they did not seem very friendly. So I started taking my shi-tsu to another groomer, I had recently moved and decided to give them another chance since they were alot closer. \n     My mistake, they were not very friendly, I am assuming they were very busy but please take some time for a little customer service. They also jacked my dog up! She looked horrible, Her cut is very uneven and she has some weird flop top on top of her head. Sadly I will not be returning to this local business, :(",0
"We have been taking our Miniature Schnauzer to Barks N Bows at 32nd St. and Thunderbird since she was old enough to get her first grooming about 7 years ago. Abby loves to go there and we couldn't ask for better results. She looks beautiful every time she goes there. In fact she is there right now. I called at the last minute on a Saturday morning so they are working her in and they didn't have to do that. Would never even consider going anywhere else. They always get a nice tip, from a very satisfied customer.",1
"Love my Dentist and Hygienist!!!  I started going here in 06. They were my 1st  choice because they were right next to where I worked at that time. So it was easy to go there over my lunch. Now in 07, I moved to Seattle and back to Phoenix in 08. Even though I live clear across town about 20-25 mins drive, I still would never go to another dentist. Besides the great service which I have become accustomed to, they also have video games in the waiting room (when I have my 10 yr old nephew), flats screens in the back, and of course those awesome cookies, with juice and water in the fridge waiting for you afterwards!  I've never waited too long before any appointment. I typically get there right on time, and they are ready for me. Love them, Love them, Love them. I always have the same Hygienist too. I feel like I'm going to see an old friend. This is as good as it gets.",1
"What a disappointment. Starting with the salsa brought with the chips to the actuall meal, the food felt cheap. What do I mean by that? The meat was fatty. The flavors were bland. The presentation was awful. Everything was doused in a very unappealing and very disgusting green sauce.\n\nI'm a huge fan of Mexican food and have had my exact meal at other restaurants. 3 Margaritas just isn't up to par.\n\nThe worst part, $37 plus tip for two meals and two kids meals. Save your money and go somewhere else.",0
"Gross!  I don't know how they stay in business, with the Valley so full of fabulous authentic Mexican food.\n\nHow bad was it?  Let me count the ways:\n\n- Cold, hard thick chips\n- A restroom with one broken toilet and two gargantuan \""""la cucarachas\""""-- roaches... they had to be at least as big as my hand, and they were alive\n- The apathetic attitude about said roaches when I told the hostess\n- BURNED beans-- how can you make BAD beans at a Mexican restaurant??!!  \n- Very mediocre, non memorable food\n- Amateurish service.  Friendly, but inept\n- Pricey for such crappy overall experience\n\nDO NOT waste your dining dollars here.  You'd do better at Taco Bell.",0
"I wish they could give negative stars.  I mean seriously this place is a health violation.  I have eaten Mexican food on the streets of Tijuana and almost never has it been this bad.  Gordan Ramsey needs to put this place on kitchen Nightmares.  Honestly, I joined Yelp just so I could post a review of how bad this place is.  I am not even joking when I say the marg tasted like it was made with a mixing powder like Koolaid.  I have never, ever, ever walked out without finishing my food.  I can say after 4 bites we were out the door.  Help others and warn them that this place is toxic.",0
"I am a guy that loves to go out to dinner. Whether it's with my kids, by myself or the whole family.. I love a good restaurant. I also know when to spot a crappy one. Tonight, my son found a rock, yes I said a rock, in his refried beans! It was awful. I brought it to the attention of my server, who assured me that he would let his manager know. We waited and waited and the only thing that happened that server brought me a bill! No apology, no nothing????? It was the worst exhibition of restaurant management ever. When I spoke to the manager, he almost looked at me like I put the stone in my sons food. I have never been as angry as I was at that moment... Do yourself a favor and stay away... Don't risk your meal, enjoy any other restaurant. Obviously this place has front of the house issues as well as the back the house!",0
"We wandered in here around 6pm on a Monday and the place was DEAD.  This always worries me:  is the food lousy? The service bad?  Is it overpriced?  The answer is no, no and no.\n\nThe server was pretty quick to get to our table and was very friendly.  She brought some really good roasted salsa and a side of some veggie stuff, and a big basket of chips.  She took our drink order and was a little delayed in getting back to us but apologized for the delay and took our dinner order.\n\nDinner was HUGE.  I mean seriously!  I had the Chicken Chipotle and my finance had the seafood dish.  REALLY, really good; especially the Chicken Chipotle; spicy and a lot of flavor.  And the prices were very fair.  And their HAPPY HOUR has really cheap prices for drinks and appetizers.\n\nSo why is this place so dead?  I have no idea but I liked it, and I'm pretty picky about my Mexican food (salsa makes or breaks a restaurant IMHO!). Food was fresh, hot, and served in volumes.  Service was quick and friendly.  Price was reasonable.  What am I missing here?  Check this place out because unless I came in on an unusual night, this place is good. No, not amazing, but good. Yeah, I see the other reviews.  Maybe the place is under new management or something?  Seriously, it was a good place.  Give them a try.",1
"Animals Benefit Club (ABC) is the best no-kill shelter in the Phoenix Area. Not only is the facility amazing, but the care each and every animal receives is even more amazing. Each dog has an individual run with indoor/outdoor space to come and go as they please, plus comfy bedding and toys. All the social cats have access to an enclosed outdoor area, complete with cat trees and toys galore, allowing them to sunbathe and play at will. \n\nI've adopted two dogs from here and they've been terrific. Not only am I supporting a good cause, but I'm also freeing up space so they can continue their mission. If you're considering a four-legged friend for your family, definitely consider adopting a rescue and visit ABC!",1
"I visited this place way before yelp even existed in the early ninety's. I much prefer non profits that don't treat employees and volunteers  in a degrading manner. A huge turn off to me although it happened some time ago, was listening to an employee being yelled at during one of my visits and insulted in ways that are reprehensible. While it was a while ago I can tell you that the person is still on staff at the shelter and actually runs the shelter so it is hard to imagine anything has changed. I also remember hearing staff talk about people who came to adopt siting how this or that person was just unfit to be a pet owner. To adopt from this shelter it seemed you needed to be a retired couple who never left home. Your life will need to absolutely center around your pet or you are a bad person. I have worked for many rescues in the past as a volunteer and I can say i have not witnessed such behavior anywhere else as I did at this shelter. Disgusting. \nThere is also the matter that the shelter was sued for ethical issues. One such suit included the care and ownership of a Hurricane Katrina Dog which the shelter took in under the understanding that they would care for the dog until the owner could come to Arizona. The Shelter decided to adopt out the animal and sited that there was not such an agreement. (www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/0313...) \nThere are MANY other rescues that could use your donations.",0
"I've had a terrible experience with this place.\n\nI visited to adopt a dog and the conditions of the rescue made me think twice.  They advertise being the best but that was not what I saw.  The dogs \""""comfy bedding\"""" was a towel on the cement floors. Every building reeks with the smell of urine and feces.  The cat area smelled so strongly of ammonia that I was uncomfortable having my son in there for more than the few minutes.  The grass that appears in their pictures on here is all dirt now.  \n\nEven so, there was a puppy there that I was interested in adopting so I filled out an application.  I had a woman go over it with me while I was there and I was told I would recieve a call within 24-48 hours. I was more than a little disappointed on the wait but figured it's probably a good policy.  We asked to see the puppy out of the cage and were told to go to the kennel but no one ever showed up, and I couldn't find a volunteer so we eventually left? It was very weird!\n\nI waited two days, and then three, and still no call. I decided to give them a call to let them know I was still interested in the dog. I thought maybe my leaving had them questioning my interest  No answer, but I did get a call back the next day.  \n\nThe lady who called me back was extremely rude.  On my application I had listed that I keep my dogs outside in our acre yard when I am not at home, but I was willing to install a dog door.  She proceeded to tell me that \""""that's all she needed to hear\"""" and that she wasn't interested in letting me adopt a dog.  I reiterated that I have a barn with misters and I would happily install a dog door but she already had a terrible attitude. She requested that I send pictures of the barn, which I am happy to do and tried to hang up on me.  I asked her when I could expect to hear on the puppy after the pictures were sent and she replied that they are very busy and she tried to hang up on me again!  So then I let her know that I was very frustrated and that the customer service so far had been terrible.  She said the dogs weren't ready to be adopted anyway even though they were listed on the website as available.  I told her that I wasn't surprised that this rescue was full because I feel like I've been getting the run around and so many other shelters and rescues are so much nicer and have much nicer accomidations for the animals.  She was obviously taking this conversations all very personally and got very upset and told me that it was volunteer run like that was an acceptable reason.  You can tell! No one getting paid would ever consider treating a customer or anyone the way this lady was talking to me. I reiterated that this wasn't about her, and that I was just trying to let her know that so far this process has been really frustrating, and she hung up on me.\n\nI don't recommend this place at all. Also the photos on here are not a true representation of how the rescue looks.",0
"ABC takes great care of not only the animals they save, but the conditions in which they live as well. The staff obviously works hard at keeping the facilities as clean and comfortable as possible. They know the needs and likes of every singe dog and cat and accommodate them accordingly. As someone with experience with other shelters, I admire their dedication in wanting only the best for the animals they adopt out.",1
"Tedious adoption process with no calls back from the people running the place. Really disappointing because we were ready to adopt a dog but couldn't get anyone to call us back- we left 3 messages and sent 2 emails. I was told that only one person could \""""sign off\"""" on the adoption of the dog we wanted. They also said it would take several days for the adoption process. I was ok with that, but after 3 weeks and no communication we went to Halo Rescue instead and was able to fill out the paperwork, bring our dogs for a meet and greet, and bring our new dog home all within 24 hours.",0
"Wow!  For those you who can't stand waiting in the waiting room of a doctor's office and feel your blood pressure raising by the minute feeling like yet another doctor's office gives no consequence to the importance of your time since they are double or triple booking their appointments, this office is for you!\nClean, modern, nicely decorated waiting room.  Efficient front office staff.  Misti Barteli, D.O. was efficient and friendly.  I did not feel rushed.  I felt like she would have answered any questions had I had any.  My appointment was at 1:45pm and I was out by 2:20pm.  Made me so happy!  \nWhy not  a 5-star?  The front office staff could have been a little friendlier.  They were efficient but I felt like I was barked at, just a little.",1
I have lived in Scottsdale for about 3 years now and I have had such a hard time finding good doctors. I have had bad experiences at almost ever doctor's office I've been to. When I went to Cornerstone Women's Health I was so pleased. The office staff were so nice and efficient. I got lost and showed up late but I didn't have to wait at all and they weren't rude about my late arrival. I saw Dr. Pelopida and I thought she was wonderful. She didn't act rushed and she listened to me thoroughly. She was very personable and knowledgeable. I was very pleased with the entire experience and I absolutely recommend this practice.,1
"I came in upon a friend's recommendation for my annual check up. It was the basic drill. Check in, paperwork, wait, pee in a cup, wait, see the nurse for vitals, undress, wait, see doc, dress, blood work, pay, reschedule. Clearly, those are a lot of steps with different people in different rooms of the office. The problem is that no one bothers to tell you where to go or what to do next. If you are brand new to the office, you better buck up and figure it out yourself. Don't bother asking for help. Asking questions only irritates the staff and they aren't shy to show you that they think you are stupid for not knowing their exact urine sample procedures. Grrrr!\n\nSo the doctor was nice enough...no complaints on that front.  The girls in the blood lab were really the only people with any personality, compassion or care at all.   I ended up getting a follow up call on the blood work that turned out to be nothing thankfully. However, I was appalled at the process. They left and abrupt, alarming and very vague voice mail. When I called back, I got lost in their automated system and then put on hold for an eternity. They finally asked me who had called me...needed the name of the nurse. I was like...\""""I don't know. Can't you look me up?  Don't you have a computer?\"""". After much haggling  I finally spoke to someone who could tell me what was wrong with me. Well, that's an overstatement.  I asked a couple of elementary questions and the lady couldn't answer a thing and recommended that  I go to WebMD to get answers. Really? \n\nSo, I came back for a follow up visit, hoping the experience would be more pleasant. It wasn't as bad, but certainly substandard.  Coming to the lady-doctor isn't my favorite thing to do. It's not comfortable or enjoyable. A good practice in my opinion would compensate with outstanding customer service. Cornerstone could use a little...er a lot...of training in the way of customer service.",0
"Okay call me a little crazy but, I called in to make a pregnancy appointment... Your FIRST appointment is with a Nurse practicioner!!! And than it's 4 weeks till you see a doctor... Im 8 weeks and I have been VERY high risk in that past. Eff that noise! no no no way!!!",0
"The best things that came out of my three years at Cornerstone had nothing to do with great gynocological care, no no, but oddly two great referrals that I will list here for the benefit of the reader: one to Dr. John Wells, a brilliant, gentle, and kind gastroenterologist for colonoscopies, and to Simon Med on Tatum across from Desert Ridge shopping center, a gentle compassionate place to get mammograms. Both excellent. So, thank you sincerely for those two items.\n\nAs for the care from Dr. Bartell and staff, very lacking. They overbook and generally are not interested in you as a patient unless you are of childbearing age (birth control + babies =$$$). God forbid you have a question, because you are supposed to just come in, be quiet, and then leave. Bartell also loves to do colposcopies ($900 a pop), even when they would be considered overkill by the AMA guidelines. I had 5 of them in 2.5 years due to a mild cervical dysplasia....never yielding anything more concerning than that. On the last one, she made some mistake and it resulted in a major allergic response, massive vaginal swelling and pain, and a period that was two weeks late. She would never own up to what she had done and blamed it on my body. I asked for her help in figuring out what happened and what I could do to feel better, but she and her staff just \""""circled the wagons\"""" as they say and I was left on my own. I actually got more help from an online doctor at \""""Just Ask\"""" than from her. Sad. Thankfully, I recovered, but that was it for me. \n\nFound a better gyno office and the doctor couldn't believe how many copols had been done. My labs have been perfect since the switch, I'm pleased to say. All that physical and mental trauma for nothing...a couple of her own staff told me \""""you know, you can always refuse her tests.\"""" Interesting. They seemed to sense the problems, for which I'm giving the office two stars. \n\nBottom line: I'd look elsewhere.",0
"I was recommended by my Dr. here. I waited 3 weeks for my appointment because of The paperwork for first Appointment. I get to my Appointment and they tell me a different time \""""we would have to re-schedule\"""" If it were't for the other assistant she wouldn't have even asked the Dr. To try to see me. She was very rude and acted very immature. I wish I would have gotten names, I'm 22 and really the ladies there are much more immature than me.. Except for one.. I wish I had her name.. Keep it up.. For the rest, you need new staff..",0
"I've been a patient of this clinic for over 10 years and although the doctors and NP's are AMAZING, their office staff drags this whole clinic down.\n\nIf you call here, be prepared for major attitude. They act as if you're bothering them and they seem to give the smallest amount of effort possible.\n\nNeed an rx refill? be prepared to wait for a week or more. Have questions for the nurse line? have fun waiting for that elusive call back. \n\nIt seems to take them over a week just to find my file (and really after over 10 years of being a patient, wtf??) They said it's because I changed my name when I got married-I got married almost 4 years ago and told them so at my very next appointment (and every single one after that one)\n\nIt breaks my heart to leave the doctors but just dealing with this staff for a once yearly appointment has left me with some really crappy experiences. I even spoke to Dr. Holeman about this (and even relayed that Yelp had several bad reviews talking about this very same issue)  but he seemed reluctant to even get on the phone with me about it and I felt very patronized during the call (which is surprising, normally he's a very caring doctor!)\n\nMy husband and I are working towards getting pregnant this year and I just couldn't bear the thought of having to deal with them for my prenatal care so I have found another doctor (who rocks AND has caring staff).\n\nBye bye Cornerstone :(",0
Took almost 2 MONTHS to get my record transferred to my new doctor from this office.\n\nCalled and faxed several times to get my record sent over. Poor excuses given every single time. \n\nThank you Cornerstone staff for helping me feel solidified in my decision to transfer to a new better office/Dr. I will not miss your attitude or your lack of common sense. CHEERS!,0
"I have a love hate relationship with this bar. I love the drinks specials but I hate the crowd. My friends love this bar so I come here for moral support and for some reason I can't pass up .25 cent drinks. For .25 cents you get what you pay for you probably get half a shot per drink but after 3 or 4 of these suckers you should have a good buzz. There is a weird mix of people here you've got the cowboys, hoochies, thugs, Scottsdale brats, and some regular people here and there. If you're young and single this is a good bar to hook up I always see people getting freaky on the dance floor. Stay for the bikini contest at midnight its very entertaining.",0
"if your into country dancing and beer this is your place. They do mix it up with some hip hop. Cover charge to get in, valet parking which was actually a bit silly but whatever.",0
"Hever seen country line dancers dance to Hip-Hop? It's the craziest thing...\nIf you're looking for inexperienced drinkers and crazy loud country & hip-hop you will be stoked here. Drinks are cheap and the bartenders are young & attractive. The crowd clearly has very low inhibitions and a dress code is non-existant. Apparently I missed the \""""Ladies Night Thong Contest\"""", what a bummer... lol\nI think I may be getting too old for places like the \""""Whiskey D!ck River\""""...",0
"Been here 5 times now on select Fri/Sat nights, and am very impressed with the fun, casual atmosphere.  Cover charges don't start until 8 on Friday, so of course I get there right before!  Fun place to have a girls night as the real cowboys are true gentlemen and you really do not need to be a hardcore country fan to have fun.  Last night was pretty dead, but was there about a month ago and  it was so packed I could hardly find a place to stand.  I've noticed that before about 10-11, a mostly couples crowd age 40-80 dominates, but when they head to bed, the average age drops drastically as the younger crowd starts filing in.  If you are single, there are definitely opportunities to hook up with down-to-earth people, but it would also be a fun place to come with a date. The live bands I've heard have been decent (check the website for the schedule), and there's a connected outdoor area to chill if you need a break from the loud music/dance scene.  Shot girls are available to provide decent 2/$5 shots, or you can go to one of 3 bars to order your fav drink.  Overall, a fun, safe place to chill and get your dance on.",1
"Dirty, gross, not fun at all. I love a good cowboy just like the next woman - but the night I went it was filled with a bunch of kids with no shoes on, walking around on the grossest carpet I have ever seen - why a bar would have carpet is beyond me. \nGross!",0
"Went last night for ladies night, and very pleasantly surprised. First of all, you can't beat 50 cent drinks and no cover. It's not as scary inside as it looks outside. The staff- so awesome, and friendly! Good music, but then again I'm a GINORMOUS country fan, so I'm a little biased. They also make it fun with contests and giveaways. I really can't find anything sucky about this club. There was a good amount of hotties there too! \nOh, and did I mention-50 cent drinks! \n5 stars for you Whiskey River, you got yourself a new regular!",1
"I came during Wednesday ladies night. Guys hoping for easy pickups might be disappointed even though females get in for free. Guys are stuck having to pay a $7 cover but that didn't seem to discourage huge crowds of men from entering the place. From what I observed there were far more guys than gals so if it's a hookup place the odds are stacked in favor of predator females. \n\nBoth inside and outside areas were packed with mobs of people. \n\nMusic was painfully loud hip-hop (and not good hip-hop either, assuming there is such a thing). The PA system was being overdriven to the point that all you could hear is a loud \""""thump da thump\"""" and some screaching human voices. \n\nMost of the crowd were young -- lots of tattoos etc. The men dressed like gang bangers, thugs, and bums. Women looked like sluts and biker chics. Most of the females came and left in groups, so it didn't seem the young bucs were scoring very often.\n\nEveryone was yelling at each other so that they could be heard over the music. It was quite a cacophony. \n\nI had to wonder why young people are willing to put up with such abysmal conditions. Cheap drinks, perhaps? Everywhere it was crowded and hot, and the stench of sweat and vomit couldn't be avoided. If they are there to hook up, how do they find somebody when there is so much noise it's impossible to talk to each other (maybe that's the idea, LOL!).\n\nThe dance floor was small considering the size of the crowd -- but nobody knows how to dance anyway so who cares? \n\nI have heard WR is better in the early evening when the country dancers are there (I arrived after 11 pm). Once the hip hoppers arrive the adults leave. Maybe I'll try going there again for the country dancing but for now I got a belly full of the place.",0
"200th review!!!!!!!!!!! \n\nFriend and I were headed out to paint the town red and run amuck and we met up with some other friends in north phoenix down at the Whisky River, now I have never been and let's just say I'm more of an RNB kinda girl but with that said, I did find myself having fun, no cover charge before 9 and well drinks 50cents till 11, now this place is alright with me! haha\n\nPeople were friendly, bartenders & staff were nice, and dance floor was wooden and round had folks dancing and having a good time. \n\nI'm going to be honest, I dug the 50cent drinks, drank me some whiskey and coke all night long, well at least to 11. Had a great group of girlfriends and just a great time! \n\nIsn't it funny how once you start drinking someone in the group says Hey lets go somewhere else and see what's up!  I know the DD's that night got some miles on their car LOL,,,so we went off to our next spot!",1
"DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH. \n\nAnd by rough I mean its a rough area and you would literally have no idea this hidden gem was tucked behind all these small businesses. \n\nThe night to go??? Wednesday... *hummmmp dayyyyyy* woot WOOOT! \n\nthe best part of WR on a Wednesday night? TWENTY FIVE CENT BEERS. yes I said it. 25\u00a2. How many things can you buy for 25\u00a2... a pack of gum, a fake tattoo or a travel size shampoo??? Certainly not a BEER though right??? You stand corrected.  \nThe place is packed with an array of different crowds all brought in by the wide variety of music (ranging from hip hop to country) and the extremely awesome, people watching. From the proffesional level country dancing to the twerking gone wild the dance floor is the place to be for people watching. If that wasn't enough they also have a wet T-shirt contest and ladies get in for free. BOOM. you , are, welcome .",1
"It's my understanding that some married ladies I know went to Whiskey River for a girl's night, and were asked to leave because they were wearing wedding rings and were deemed \""""unattainable\"""". I'd really like to know how you can justify this, if this is how you treat customers, I would not be surprised if you were facing a lawsuit for discrimination soon.",0
"This bar is okay. The atmosphere has gotta better since management has given the whole bar an updated look, which has been well over due. The staff is genuinely friendly and no one can really argue with 50 cent drinks. However when going to bar I expect to be at a place that is 21 and up. That isn't the case here. Whiskey river has numerous regulars that are under 21 and instead of taking action against those regulars, they are allowed to continue to enter this establishment. In fact the manager greets these under age regulars with a smile and usually results in some type of photo that ends up on Facebook. \n\nNow on to the DJ, granted I wasn't the biggest fan of the previous DJ since there were times he was incredibly rude for no apparent reason. Now seeing that the previous DJ would yell at those country dancers doing tricks past 9 it seems the new DJ has a positive note however he has more negatives than positives going for him. He doesn't play songs that are requested by the customers and it appears that he is only concerned with getting the mixes he has created heard. Normally I wouldn't have a problem with this but after listening to hip hop and rap for over an hour, I tend to grow impatient especially when I have gone to the DJ booth and requested a song and I am informed that the manager wants him to continue to play hip hop and rap. I'm sure he does..\n\nAs much as I love to country dance, I'd rather do it at a bar that doesn't allow under age customers and where the DJ actually plays requested songs instead of his personal creations.",0

"falafel phoenix best falafel best phoenix best falafel phoenix best phoenix falafel phoenix falafel best phoenix best falafel\n\n6 Star Falafel !    IT'S GREEN!\n\nSeriously the best in the valley, perhaps anywhere.  AND IT'S GREEN!\n\nIt really does look like some hippies may have cooked up a batch of \""""Magic Falafel\"""" in the back of their VW camper bus in the Shakedown Street parking lot of a Dead concert.  I'm sure it's more benign spices making these garbanzo flour patties the color of money, grass, and a soccer player's ass, but they are a mos def a HOMEMADE recipe.  I'm not saying all light brown falafel is from a box, but that's what most gyro places are doing.  \n     8^ P`.',.`    ---pPbblltptllptbt\nI can do box all by myself.\n\nVarious kebobs, dolmas, greek and tabouli salads, pita sandwiches -- \nthe menu is classic greek fast food deli style, which just like the strip mall pad they occupy, the menu is a bit smaller than it used to be. \nThey've changed ownership and also pared down the size of their store significantly since their heyday.  \nYusef's was Best of Phoenix by New Times, or AZ Republic, or Get Out, etc, quite a bit circa 90, 92, 93, 95, 96, 2001 if I remember the signage.  Since then, things have gotten tough in the American economy for a niche market of Middle Eastern folks.  I sure hope they didn't suffer from former customers purposefully avoiding them after 2001 for any sort of discriminatory reasons -- what a shame that would be!\n\nPerusing the aisles of the grocery while waiting for your food to be prepared is like being flashed to an indoor version of an exotic marketplace bazaar (like in the first Indiana Jones movie, or hey, like Shakedown Street) full of strange and enticing shapes and smells and textures, foreign languages, and lots of \""""What the heck is THIS!?\"""".  \n\nSpice grinders!

"Used to be great, now there's a new owner. He smokes inside the store. Menu the same, but the portions are smaller. Sad, I won't go back.",0
"Stopped in for the first time not having known for 10 years that we were neighbors.  I'll start with the fact that the owner/operator was extremely polite greeting you when you enter and welcoming you.  I had my 2 toddlers in tow, and this can be intimidating to most small shop owners knowing one bad move can cause chaos from a toddler.  We sat down ordered some meals, lamb gyro, chicken ka-bob sandwich, hummus.  Easy mediteranean meal almost imposible to mess it up.  We walked in at opening so it took 10 minutes or so for food, but the array of goods in the market to shop made the time fly.  With no prompting they took it upon them selves to split the gyru meal for my kids, which was awesome and a super time saver for me.  The flat bread pita was good more authentic to the chew than the buttery mall version (though I like both).  The meat was perfect the lamb tender with a nice sear on it, very generous thickness as well preserving the meat texture.  their tatziki was a chunky version with great flavor and a crisp cucumber crunch through-out very refreshing in the 100+ degree lunch temps we were having.  The chicken was good with a nice subtle flavor and plenty of juice left inside the well grilled meat.  \nThe hummus was traditional and very smooth more dip than spread.  \nOverall I am super impressed, the market has every canned and jarred good you could imagine from SPAM to stuffed Olive leaves and all stops in between.  The deli counter had a simple variety of olives and various feta cheeses, their produce was depleted (possibly because I walked in as they unlocked the doors) or not stocked yet.  I will be returning to shop and to eat again.  The welcoming owner made me feel as though my children will also be dining there regularly.  I will try to work my way through their menu board over the coming weeks, and will try to report back.",1
"I usually come here once or twice a week. I love their gyros and fries - both very authentic and served Chicago-style. The staff are very friendly and accommodating, and they serve some good desserts as well. Good selection of Middle Eastern sodas, snacks, and other ingredients as well. I'm a fan!",1

Very tasty and friendly service at the market. Picked up some fresh ground Turkish coffee while there.,1
"The food is excellent. The prices are very reasonable. The people are pleasant. In addition to the four tables for dining in, there is a fascinating array of groceries for sale.

"Stopped in and was greeted by hostess who was polite and friendly. Service from waiter, Gavin, who explained the food and recommended plates. Very professional and friendly. Ordered calamari as appetizer and it was delicious. Ordered the salmon and it was good. The Tiramasu I ordered for dessert was ok.  The place is small and there is an outdoor eating area .

Do not go here. Horrible costumer service. Return policy from the dark ages...even on unopened nonpersonal item bought just hours before. Surprised they think that they can still treat people this way when there are so many other wonderful options.,0
"I bought a pair of shoes from Dee's. I was starting a new dance class and was excited about it! I was a little concerned about my final selection because of an injury, but the saleswoman assured me I could exchange them if they weren't too worn. I wore the shoes once to a dance class and they were just too small to dance in. When I went in to exchange them for a bigger size, I was told they wouldn't exchange them once they were worn. This surprised me. So, I talked to Jamie, the owner or manager, who said she would check things out with her employee and call me back that day, but based on her employee's notes, I had been notified of their no return, no exchange once worn policy. I didn't receive a call back that day or the next.  Even if this is their policy, it wasn't clearly explained, and they didn't follow up. Now I have a pair of shoes I can't wear and need to buy another pair. I won't be buying them there. It's so short sighted. These shoes probably cost them $20 wholesale. Was that worth losing my goodwill and a bad YELP review?",0
"One would typically think that going through a drivethrough may somewhat insinuate someone might be eating in the car! Hub ordered a chicken sandwich (plain, only cheese), myself, 3 small sides (corn, mashed potatoes and mac and cheese). We are told this will be 17 dollars!? Wow! So this starts a car fight of how this can possibly be so? So, when we get the window, it's actually 13. Okay, that's better. As we pull off to head to our event for the evening, we open the bag to find there is no fork, no napkins, and  his sandwich is the absolute farthest thing from \""""Plain\"""".

"First I should say that this review doesn't reflect the service of the employees.  They were great.  \nBoston Market recently came out with a rib or rib/chicken combo.  Both myself and my husband decided to try the rib/chicken combo.  Did NOT LIKE the ribs at all (they are st louis style and they have a horrible texture, too much fat and not enough meat and the sauce is lousy.  Actually didn't like the chicken too much either  :(\nOur sides were the garlicky lemon spinach and mac and cheese and both these were very good as was the biscuit.  For what you pay this meal is definitely not worth it.",0
I've been here several times. The drive through service is really fast. The staff is very friendly. It is right on the corner of 40th street and Thunderbird.  The dining area is clean and  neat. Remy is great. He's always friendly and helpful.,1
They have changed owners and we do not go there. They do not go out of their way to help you in a crunch. No need for them with so many other places to choose from.,0
"I had a great experience with this flower shop.  First off, I love that they were the only shop open before I was leaving for work!  Secondly, the owner was very friendly and accommodating.  I really liked a bouquet that I saw online and when I got there and ordered it, she let me customize it!  I was able to replace some flowers in the design that I wasn't really excited about and she gave me a beautiful vase to match the flowers :)  Overall, great experience!

"\""""Fuck you all, we hope you die.\nThat's the Trojan Battle Cry!\""""\nWow, I can not believe someone Yelp'ed PV. \n My freshman year, my science teacher was arrested from embezzling from the strip joint she owned. We then had a different teacher every couple of weeks for the first half of the year. When we finally got a permanent teacher, the damage was done. The kids had no connection or respect for any teacher who walked in the door anymore.\n  The year I graduated, there were 3000 students and over 1000 in my graduating class. We often had 40+ kids in one classroom. \nMan, I hated this school. When I first started on the Bell Rd Campus, we referred to it as PV Prison because of the tall, iron, spiked gates and security in golf carts patrolling the campus for potential escapees. I remember, before they briefly closed the campus for renovations, a girl falling through the auditorium wall, and pieces of the ceiling falling on peoples heads before they condemned it. After 2 years at this location, they suddenly closed the campus and opened the new campus on Union Hills, the campus that was to become North Canyon.\n They built the new campus with the intention of having both schools open, but as more and more buildings kept falling apart, they decided to shut down PV and re-open it under the same name on the new campus. \n They spent a shit-ton fuck load of money on a super high-tech theater, in return for letting it be used for official Gov't events,  that no one new how to use. This was one of the best things about it. I was one of the few people who could run the sound and lights and got out of class frequently because of it. \n I remember making a video with Casey about an art show the school was having and not being allowed to air it on the morning video announcements because we used the phrase \""""come out of the closet\"""" and they thought the phrase might be offensive. Then, that same week, the football team had a video where they all pretended to be gay, talking with lisps and flailing limp wrists. When I went to the office to ask what the fuck, they told me that football players didn't need approval for anything they did. I remember my friend being expelled for missing too much school due to chicken pox and a mother not well enough to call her in. I, of course, seemed invisible to the system. I ditched class often, and it never showed on my record at all. I remember when Miss Lee dressed as a hard rocker with tattoo's for halloween and the administrators making her change it because the costume was a bad influence. I remember my friends boyfriend being suspended because they searched his car for drugs (on an anonymous tip) and found a box cutter in his trunk he used for work which he kept in his trunk because he went to work straight from school.  I remember testing out of highschool classes before freshman year, yet being subjected to 4 years of bullshit. I am pretty sure it was PVUSD that was the inspiration for the movie \""""Pump Up the Volume\"""", which was filmed in the general area.\n  When I quit the softball team, the coach/school councilor kept sending people to pull me out of class to try to talk me into playing again. When we took pictures for the badminton team, we didn't have enough uniforms for the entire team. \n I felt like I was in some prison or some high security mental facility. In fact, when my mom visited the new campus, she was horrified there were no windows and they used the drab, grey/blue colors they use in mental hospitals she had worked in to keep the patients calm. I never had a chemistry class. My two history classes consisted of a teacher who spent one entire year talking about Shakespear, and another who said that \""""The slaves did not have it so bad\"""".  My Biology book was so old, it had my friends mothers name in it from 20 years earlier, AND same friends mother warned me against my Biology teacher, Mr. H__. \""""If he ever tells you to stay after class by yourself.. DON'T.\""""  \n \nThe Good Things I Remember -\n Mrs. Toal [sp?], a very good, and supportive, English teacher. Miss Lee, the best photography/video teacher ever and always had the best Halloween costumes. Hanging out at lunch under a tree with the boy we called Rico Suave who said he lived in a box and would tell stories about the Horny Lady. Sneaking off campus to go to Barrows Pizza. My friends  wearing cut out Trojan condom boxes pinned to their shirt at the forced \""""spirit assemblies\"""" and chanting our own spirit chant of \""""Fuck you all we hope you die, that's the Trojan battle cry\"""".\n\n Time has a way of blurring the past, and making it less icky. Yet, my sister is a teacher at North Canyon, and a few years back I went and visited her on campus. The second I stepped into the main building, I felt sick to my stomach. Literally. \n I hear they have made improvements since I graduated, and I hope so. I don't want my niece and nephew forced to survive another drone factory.",0
Mornings are terrible trying to get in  and out of the parking lots!,1
$79 for 10 shirts and a suit! WOW that's what I get for trying to support my local business!  RIP OFF ALERT!,0
"I dropped off a brand new pair of slacks to be cleaned and pressed.  When I picked them up, one of the hooks on the front flap had been torn off and the flap was ripped beyond repair.  I brought the pants back the next day they apologized and then denied responsibility.  They said, \""""how do we know you didn't bring them to us that way or that it happened after you picked the pants up\"""".  Never, ever go there.",0
"After 14 years of taking my clothing here I am starting to notice a trend that's brought much unhappiness.  For the past few months, Pat's on greenway and Tatum have ruined a few articles of clothing. The first was a new white shirt that had come back with black grease all over the bottom of the shirt. Its the kind of grease that looks like the stuff you would use on a machine to lube the working parts. The second garment was a Tommy Bahama silk shirt. Again with the grease, but this time large bleach spots all over  the back. Lastly, a few if my wife's dresses... bleach spots all over. I really wish this cleaner would figure out their issues or else I need to go somewhere else.",0
"Over Priced! I brought in 3 items, one long sleeve blouse charged 7.50 which I could understand then 2 small tank top/cropped shirt/blouses which they also charged me 7.50 each. Less material by far and when I questioned the lady she apologized and said that the guy who rang me up shouldn't have charged that much for the shirts, but at that time wasn't able to adjust the amount because she wasn't authorized in the computer to do so. I won't make this mistake again!",0
"How on gods green earth does this place have 5 stars? I had the worse experience today and would never, ever recommend this place to anyone. \n\n1. They had extreme police videos on Spike tv on full blast the whole time. I always bring my kindle to nail salons to read while I get my pedicure and could not concentrate at all because the volume was so loud. \n\nThe women who was doing my mani and gel pedi was way more concerned with the tv than my nails, to the point that she cut me while trimming my cuticles. I had to tell her that I was bleeding before she even noticed, she had literally just been watching the tv for about 30 seconds WHILE USING A SHARP OBJECT ON ME!!! \n\nI dont know about any of you, but when I go to a nail salon I want to relax a little bit, not listen to sirens, gun shots or a narrator talk about how long people will be in prison for trying to kill their husband... maybe I am crazy though? \n\n2. The gel manicure itself was horrible, 4 of my fingers have polish along the back of my nail bed and my pinky does not have any polish along one side. I tried telling the women while was doing the mani, but she just kept shaking her head and say it was fine, I am pretty sure she did not understand me. \n\n3. After she was done, I politely said \""""I am very unhappy, this is not the type of manicure I am used to.\"""" She said, that she thought that they looked great and acted as though I was crazy. All the workers at this point started talking and the owner came over. She was young, and clearly lacked experience in customer service. She did not offer to fix them and said I had to pay. I gave her my credit card and told her I would never be back. \n\n\nHORRIBLE!!!!!",0
"If I could give them 0 stars I would've. They first told me there would be a 20min wait only for me to come back and wait another 20mins. As it was 30mins until closing time, my pink and white full set turn out to look uneven w/ bubbles in the gel, can't tell that it was even done w/pink powder, and full of brush strokes as the guy was clearly in a hurry & didn't care if there was enough gel on the brush.\n I will never be going there again other then tomorrow when I show them the horrible, half ass job he did. Don't waste your time or money.",0
I went into this location yesterday and stood around for 20 min waiting to be helped. Finally got tired of waiting and went personally to the garage and found 1 guy doing work and the other off on his phone texting. I explained how i had been waiting and what the issue was with my car. All this for him to tell me to go see Matthew. Matthew was no where in site! Ugh finally said screw everyone and ill just tow my car home. This location will never receive my business.,0
"I arrived at 8:55a, five minutes before my oil change reservation.  A gentleman at the service counter said he would be right with me and when he finished up he asked how he could help.  I told him I had a reservation for an oil change at 9.  He got all my info and directed me to the waiting room.  I asked how long it would take.  He said that they would be pulling may car into the garage and that it should be done in \""""no time.\""""\n\nAfter waiting 45 minutes my vehicle still had not been moved from spot I parked in when I arrived at the shop.  Work had, however, begun on the vehicles belonging to the two gentleman that arrived after me.  I questioned the manager about the situation and assure me it was a mistake and apologized.  Whatever.\n\nSince I knew I would still be there for a while, I cruised around the store to pass the time.  I had a question about some of the car wash/wax products, so I asked an associate for help.  He had no product knowledge and was unable to explain the differences between the products despite the significant price difference.  He realized I was annoyed with his lack of useful information and explained that he had a \""""crappy car\"""" so he didn't use and of the wash and wax products.  Whatever.\n\nFinally, at 1030a, my vehicle was ready.  They get two starts for completing the service, but that is it.  I will not return to this location.",0
This location does not even deserve one star. Will give them a star so I can write a review.\n\nI have been going to this place for about 16 years. The first 14 years the service was ok. Close to my home and they have convient hours. I would give them 3 stars for the first 14 years. \n\nPast two years they changed the management and it shows in the service. Many things have gone wrong with this Pep Boys location the past few visits. Will NEVER go to this location again. Dont feel like explaining the issues I had cause there are too many and I get irriatated. So many other places to choose from. Looking forward to trying a new garage. No way will they be worse than this location. \n\nA couple of friends feel the same way. Just from us this location is going to lose a lot of business.,0
"Okay i don't even know where to start... i have been going to this Pep Boys since forever because it is right down the street. But, so I've been told, they changed the management 2 years ago, and it REALLY shows in their service. i was just there today, and i don't care to go into detail because i'm going to get upset again, but basically, the service is SLOW,they are just rude and don't want to take time with a PAYING COSTUMER. The service men are always messing around and they are just as useless as the people running the place inside. They messed up my warranty on my car battery and wouldn't help me change anything because the guy that sold it to me didn't work there anymore so there was \""""nothing they could do about it'. AND THEN they mess up the charges at the end, and were trying to charge me $40 more than what was talked about to begin with. Idk i was just so frustrated waiting in the freezing cold waiting room and was just annoyed at all of them the whole time. Never again.",0
One word SLOW appointments are worthless. You arrive 15 minutes early and get in 45 minutes late. They say 45 minutes to an hour it takes 2 hours.,0
"Went in leaking coolant looking for a diagnosis and wanted and oil change, turns out my head gasket is blown so they said, later on he didn't realize it but he said it might be blown. This has happened before, as soon as you mention you overheated once just a little the diagnosis is needing a new head gasket. even if there's no white smoke, oil in coolant, coolant in oil, loss of power or all of the other symptoms of a blown head gasket. It's an expensive repair and one they seem to love suggesting you need done. They found I am leaking coolant from my water pump which seems like a reasonable diagnosis. Your service guy needs a little lesson in tact in letting people know they're car needs a lot of work too.",0
"bought tires a few years ago and they said they would be in in 2 days when in and not there and that happen 2 more times. then they finally got it on about 3 weeks later i hit a nail close to my side wall and the tire had less than 100 miles. they decided they could patch it. i also go the road hazard warranty. about 4 months later i hit a nail 2 inches from were the other nail was equivalent to. they said they would give me a premium tire.  walked out and never went back. so the moral of my storie is, if its going to cost them money then there going to try to do it for cheaper if its going to cost you money then your going to have to pay top dollar",0
"Terrible service experience! I went in to buy some tires, so I was waiting at the tire service counter with one person in front of me and another behind me. The advisor who was helping the person in front of me said to me I'll be with you in just a moment sir, at which I nodded and said that's fine. Well after about 10 mins I am still waiting... now the person in front of me is outside the store with the advisor, I am at the counter waiting for help, one person behind me. While I am at tbe counter, another advisor walks up to the person behind me and says how can I help you, and took them to another service counter. The person behind me was foreign, and obviously didn't get that what she was doing was rude behavior, however the Service Advisor should have! I waited 5 more minutes to no avail, I left the store, they lost a sale. Very unprofessional, I will not go here again.",0
"I have a 2013 ford, base model, and I went to this pep boys to get an oil change and tire rotation. The customer service rep was awesome!! However it took an hour and a half because \""""I had to take a lot of stuff off and this car is really new\"""" in the words of the mechanic. And the icing on the cake was that he couldn't figure out how to reset the oil change light and that I need to take it to the dealer and have them do it. Awesome. I have always gone to pepboys in California and they have never had an issue with this. Looks like the manager of this location needs to evaluate the training of his employees.",0
"This place is hit or miss. I had a really nice guy the first time but this last time was horrible. I waited by customer service while 5 people were doing whatever behind the counter. I asked for help and they said they would be right with me. Another 5 minutes later I ask this other guy, Maunel for help. He is polite and apologized for the wait. I aka for an oil change and rotation and ask for my fluids to be topped off. He says there's a 45 min wait and I said just call me when it's finished. An hour and a half goes by and no call. Manuel's at lunch and so a guy checks us out. He is nice and friendly. He confirmed all the work was done that I asked. But next day oil light comes on and the fluids aren't filled. So much for that. Called manager and they said they needed to see the car to confirm there was no oil in it. Some service! Oh and they told me they don't actually fill fluids up so if you want full service or good service better try elsewhere!",0
"Totally diff from the Cantina in Scotts obviously no chips and salsa  here. This is a great neighborhood bar I basically lived here thru football season's ages ago. If you hate Raider fan's I suggest steering clear of the times they play (if they still have the club there that is) Raider fan's are crazy and it is usually not so much fun after the games when they lose which is most of the time! They do have many many tvs their site says 24 total. They have a seperate area for betting on the dog races that was always huge with the older crowd. \n\nThey use that canned shredded meat here in some meals which I think people immediately love it or hate it. I dont like it so much it's too salty and soggy but I never really liked meat anyway. I solved that problem and just eat sushi now, so who am I to say if the chicken is really good or not?!?! I am fine with some fried zucchini or those stuffed jalapeno things or even nachos minus the meat. I remember their wraps as being really good though! Don't confuse the bartender by asking for a foofoo mixed drink. You mill be lucky if they have some flavored vodka. Beer is king here and I seen a many people do Irish car bombs but hey you cant really get those wrong now, can you? Beer me please!",1
"If you have a craving for a good, greasy cheeseburger look no further! Whenever I have the craving I'm right there. \n\nNow, if you like mozzarella sticks and I mean the real ones don't order them here. What they call mozzarella sticks are basically two giant logs, yuck! They just don't taste good. \n\nBeer is always cheap here and the mixed drinks are okay if you say not too much ice. \n\nBasically it's a great neighborhood bar to chill and watch some sports on the many t.v.'s and eat good food.",1
"I came here with my boyfriend and his friends before we left AZ to go back to the bay. I was surprised to see that there weren't tons of people in there as it was a Monday night and tons of games on.\n\nBrennan's is a hug bar and has tons of seating and tv's to get your sports fix. We found a booth and were warmly greeted by our server. The boy and his friends ordered 35 cent wings and I had a cheeseburger with curly fries.\n\nMy cheeseburger and curly fries totally hit the spot. The curly fries were were crispy and had tons of flavor, they were a little spicy. The burger was really filling and was exactly what I wanted! The boys completely devoured their wings, and at 35 cents, you can imagine just how many they had between them.\n\nFor our flight, my boyfriend ordered the margarita chicken wrap and it tasted great even a few hours later...yum!\n\nBrennan's is a solid spot to catch a game and grab some yummy pub food in a laidback environment.",1
"We are pretty much regulars at Brennans now. It is a reliable place to watch the game with cheap drinks. There is a great view of the TV from almost every spot.\n\nThe bartenders are AWESOME. They are quick,  friendly, and really seem to care about providing good service. \n\nThe servers are good too. Very sweet and take care of their regulars. There is confusion among them sometimes about who is helping our table but it is usually resolved quickly and they are apologetic.\n\nThe food that is good is very good, the food that is bad is pretty bad. Luckily, the number of items on the menu that is good outnumbers the bad. Here is a rundown on the good stuff- the Irish Nachos, Mexican pizza, cheese curds, potato skins, wings, enchiladas. All pretty good. Oh, and salsa too. It's freshly made and very zippy!\n\nI would stay away from the zucchini and mozzarella sticks. Both are too greasy and lacking in flavor. The mozzarella stick is ginormous, which seems appealing at first but it is just too much cheese and too little breading. \n\nI wish they had more food specials because the appetizers will set you back 7-10 bucks a plate. But the portions are huge. They do have an amazing mexican night on Tuesday. $1.25 enchiladas and tacos. And we were pleasantly surprised about how tasty the tacos and enchiladas are. \n\nThe crowd in Brennans is diverse and interesting. I love a diverse crowd and all but be prepared to listen to either a full hour of country or a full hour of gangsta rap on the jukebox. That can get annoying when the jukebox is completely dominated by a person whose musical tastes are limited to one genre. \n\nOverall, we love Brennans and we can call it our home away from home.",1
"I've recently been trying to find a cool place to play shuffleboard in North Phoenix.  I was trying to find a place to hang out near my bro's house so we could go hang out for a bit and have a beer.  I found Brennan's online and noted that they had shuffleboard.  WIN WIN!!  The review said that the staff was friendly and called you \""""honey\"""" even if it was the first time you had ever been there.  BANG!  sounds like my kinda joint, so  i called my bro and said, \""""hey man, let's go to this joint by your house and play some shuffleboard and have a beer\"""".  So, off we went.  I got there and when I approached the bar, the bartender looked at me like I was from Mars. I said hello, FIRST. She says Hi.  Then I said \""""How's it going?\""""  I felt like I was demonstrating to her how to greet a customer. So I ordered drinks, asked for shuffleboard disks and some menus. I was told that I could grab my own menu and that if I wanted something, I needed to come back and order.  Cool,  no biggie,  but no points for hospitality there.  No real attempt at gaining some sort of an EARNED tip, no prob, it's only my first impression of the place.  SO,  we play some shuffle board.  5 red disks, 3 blue, that's all they have and the shuffleboard table was not in proper working order and it wasn't like the guy sitting on his butt in the office right there was gonna check on us to see if everthing was okay.  So, it don't matter, we's having some beers and it's all good.  We get hungry and decide to look at the menus.  The menus said that THURSDAY was Indian Fry Bread day. Apparently, I am told that they haven't done that IN A LONG TIME.  I guess they didn't get around to changing the menu, but hey it's only my first impression of the joint.  Glad the regulars love it, they can have it.  Oh and I agree with a former poster about the Irish draw of the place.  I thought it was gonna be an Irish place,  not even close.  Crappy hospitality, limited beer menu etc......",0
"We ate at Brennan's last night.  The waitress did not write our order down, and my husband had some special requests.   The meal came, and all requests were ignored.  In addition, it was cold.   My husband complained, and was brought another serving of beans.  However, because of the food on the original plate, he was not able to eat his entire meal.  We did talk to the waitress about the importance of customer service and how disappointed we were.",0
"I loved coming here on Saturdays for sex trivia. However, there is this one waiter that would always serve us that was completely rude, smart mouthed, and just an all around bad attitude. I was just in utter shock how a person that relies on tips for their living could be so rude. Since the last encounter with him, we haven't been back. It's a real shame because I really enjoyed hanging out there.",0
"Not sure why Brennan's was not on this list.  This a great place if you like laid back dive bars.  We have been going there for 6 years.  On Saturday's they have half price burgers that are phenomenal.  Saturday nights they have trivia.  Pool tables, shuffleboard, silver strike bowling.  It's a lot bigger on the inside than it looks from the outside.",1
"Horrible horrible service. Beer and food is great, neighborhood bar so it's convenient. Went in today for my last time. They were short handed which I could understand, but the managers were even terrible. Server never brought our food, let alone check on us. I had to get up to get a beer, napkins, plates, etc. Had to basically yell and wave my arms just to get the check...we complained about the service only to get a \""""thumbs up\"""" and a smile then walked away....LITTERALLY. No joke. The manager kept saying he would get our server to us, which never happened. All tables around us were just as unsatisfied.  Too bad for them, I know after today many people will not be back.",0
Taco Tuesday has the most amazing specials! Friday and Saturday nights are ridiculous fun!! My home away from home!,1
"I love this bar. They have amazing nachos and the staff is amazing - Jaki, Kaleigh and Wayne. I don't ever have to wait long for a drink. Oh yeah and sex trivia on Saturday night is so much fun.",1
This place has completely given up. I don't know if they have had new owners within the last 4 months or so but its gotten really bad. Unless your one of the regulars who have probably been drinking since 11am you don't get much attention here.\n\nJust went there tonight for the 35 cent wings on Monday night. Waited 5 minutes before the lazy waitress decided to come greet me. Placed my order right away as I could tell how often I would see her again. Just got 2 dozen wings. ....... 45MINS LATER my wings show up. Not exaggerating at all. NEWSFLASH- Wings take 8mins in the fryer...why would I have to wait 45mins??? When they finally showed up I let her know Ill just take them to go since Im out of time. She didn't seem to care at all I was clearly upset. Also NOT ONE TIME did she refill my drink...not one time. And to top of the whole fun experience I get the check to find out they have stopped the wings deal on Monday. \n\nIts sad cause I used to go here with all my friends every Monday and this place had good waitresses who cared but like I said earlier these people now don't care one bit. NEVER AGAIN. Thank Jackie for the great experience and hope you can find another dump hole to work in 6 months when this place is closed.,0
Hmmmmmmm when u walk in there's a mold smell. There is a one stall bathtoom for a pretty big bar. I find that weird.  They claim to have happy hour special which is a quarter off . Seriously ? Why bother ? Seems like alot of regulars come to this barm we r only stopped by cause we r going nto movies next door.  Let me say this place has the saddest rueben I have ever saw !!! See photo. My husband order ordered chicken wings he liked the sauce. We appear to be the only one in the place eating food. The waitress was super nice.  Thanks fpr paying attention dawn .,0
"Friday night, pretty busy, bar somewhat busy and the bartender (attractive, female, brunet) answers the house phone and has been talking for 15 minutes as I write this..  ????  WTF..  never coming back..",0
I cant give this place 5 stars because I didnt use their service so I cant say how it was. I did visit it though while looking for my wedding venue and it was by far the most beautiful place I saw. It was extremely out of my budget though.,1
"Boojum Tree was absolutely magical. Every single guest came up to me and said it was the most beautiful venue they had ever been to. I also had a lot of set up and take down and Tasha was amazing. She answered all my questions, set the decorations up perfectly, organized and helped direct the ceremony and reception, and completed the break-down. She is also very friendly, nice, and just a great person. I think I hugged her about 100 times. I definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a one of a kind venue that people will be talking about for years!",1
"We recently attended a friend's wedding at the Boojum Tree. As we entered I thought it was a beautiful place. It's vintage and eclectic. I loved the western feel of the place. Here's where my love stopped: the mosquitoes. We attended the rehearsal and the wedding. After being there about half an hour for the rehearsal, I had about 5 bites. Ok no big, deal, right? After the wedding ceremony the next afternoon I doused myself in bug spray that was at the cantina. By the time we left and got home I had 42 bites on my legs and arms. I'm not even someone that gets bit by bugs normally. I felt like I was swatting at bugs all night long. It was disgusting. Obviously the venue is aware of the problem since they provide bug spray, so you'd think they'd do more to solve the problem! I'm so glad I didn't get married at a place like this. I spent the rest of my 10 day vacation in Phoenix scratching at my arms and legs! Not to mention how lovely my legs looked covered in red bumps! HAHA! \nAlso only a handful of people danced. People were too spread out in the grounds and the bride even went \""""missing\"""" for a bit when she went to see people on the other side of the venue. The bathrooms are also far away from the dinner / reception area, the dining area smells a bit moldy when you enter, but you get used to it. The lights in there are beautiful. The food was ok. I guess you can't expect much when it's being cooked for 150 people.",0
"Stopped by on Sunday around 3pm for a late lunch...place was packed!  Nice to see...had Sopes e Carnitas, Shrimp Cocktail and a Torta Milanesa....\n\nSopes and Shrimp Cocktail were great!  The Torta, not so much..bread was old, the fried steak was too thin and tasted old...it was edible...so Tortas are not their strong point.",1
"I'll be honest, we used to go here all the time. Every single time, they were rude to us, but it was worth it for the delicious chicken gorditas. However, the final straw was when we found a toothpick in our taquito. No, I dont mean it was poking out, I mean it was wrapped in the tortilla inside with the chicken. My sis BIT into it. That same time, I chomped something hard, it was a big piece of gravel. In my chicken gordita. Ok, we're gringas, but I used to work in Mexico and speak some spanish. I am used to anti-gringo attitudes, I used to get called all sorts of names walking around. However, this place is the WORST I have ever experienced, especially here in the states, and I truly believe, to this day, it was because we are gringas. Gravel doesnt just \""""accidentally\"""" get into chicken. Nor does a toothpick get fried into a taquito. I havent returned. I will always miss their gorditas.",0
The best Mexican food I have had in phoenix! I have had two friends that were born and raised in Mexico go there to test the place out and they both gave two thumbs up. The food reminded them of there grandma so it had to be delicious. Re-fried beans are amazing and so is the horchata.,1
"omg. worst mexican \""""food\"""" ever.\n\nlooking for a mexican food place on the way home from the cave creek area, we happened upon this place's relatively good reviews and decided to give it a shot. i ordered the chile relleno plate and my date ordered a chicken quesadilla. apparently the chicken quesadilla wasn't bad. but of my two chile rellenos, only one of them found it's way to the microwave, since the bottom was cold, and the cheese was hard. the beans were gray they had so much lard in them. this plate was hard to look at, let alone eat. i will not be coming back here again.",0
"Never. Again. (at this location)\n\nFriday night was rough.  On the way back from the bar I blew out a tire and changed it on the side of the road at 2 AM.  By the time I got that taken care of and got everyone home it was nearly 3.  I was spent and needed a little sustenance.  Taco Bell is almost closed, so where else to go??  I channeled the old college student within and went to Whataburger.  Whatamistake.\n\nCome to think of it I've had a couple sketchy experiences at this location (i.e., undercooked meat etc), but alcohol and/or exhaustion must have clouded my judgement.  Being the ONLY customer in the drive thru, getting a single burger should not have taken this long.  I would say it may have taken longer since they were adding a slice of cheese they so graciously charged and additional .45 cents for, but wait, they neglected to put it on at all.\n\nAfter taking one bite it all became clear.  It took so long because they must have been shaking a salt shaker above it for at least 5 minutes.  Gross.   \n\nNever. Again.",0
I have eaten here several times. The burgers are always good. I went there last night around 9 PM. I order a double meat hamburger. I must say it was one of the best I have eaten in a while. The service was above and beyond what one would expect from a fast food restaurant. The workers were very friendly and offered to refill our drinks.,1
"You won't see many fast food reviews from me as I don't generally eat fast food. \nThis place is local to me and the name reeled me in, as well as several Radio/TV commercials and a sign saying Family Owned/Operated since 1950. \nI wanted a quick burger yesterday so I decided to stop by. Checked Yelp 1st, 4 stars on 11 reviews was enough to convince me. \nNice and clean when I walked in, and greeted by an extremely nice cashier! \nTheir menu is pretty simply so I decided to give their original single burger a try and their chicken bites. Several Sauce choices for the Chicken bites, went with creamy gravy. Spent about $10 but wanted TOO much food to try! haha\nIt took about 7min or so for my food to be prepared which is fine by me. They give you a little Tag to place on your table and its brought out to you. The young mad that brought it out to me was very nice and had another tray with him offering Ketchup, Napkins, utensils. \nOn to the food! Chicken Bites were SUPER Hot! That's a great thing as they were probably made to order. Tasted great once they cooled off a bit and the Creamy Gravy was pretty good too. \nOn to the Burger! Very impressed for a Fast Food Place, I'd moreso call it Quick Food instead! Made with care, fresh ingredients and a nicely cooked pretty thin patty. \nNow, on to the fries......I am a Fry Snob, let that be known. They weren't anything special, and if I went there again I'd skip them. \nGive this place a try instead if you're going to hit one of the REAL crappy fast food places. \n\nOh, and open 24 HOURS!!!!!!",1
"After having a very good experience there the other day I decided to give them a try for a quick breakfast. They serve breakfast from 11pm-11am! WIN right there! \nIt was barely 6am and again, friendly service!\nI don't even remember the last time I ate fast food for breakfast.\nI had a Jalapeno Cheddar Sausage Biscuit and a Honey Butter Chicken Biscuit. A bit of a wait which was fine because it was made to order for me. Came out hot and was pretty damn good! Hash Browns were a bit boring and simple, but still cooked well. \nI can sum this up pretty easy now. THIS is what fast food was like everywhere 40-50yrs ago before Corporate America took over trying to pinch pennies and sacrificing quality. Probably not going to be going back for awhile because I generally don't eat like this, but great to know there is a pretty good 24HR option if I am hungry! \nGive this place a try next time you're considering one of those BIG fast food joints for nasty breakfast! You won't be let down!",1
It is a beautiful church. While I am not a Catholic myself I attended service last Sunday and this Easter Sunday. Everyone seems nice there but I just don't particularly agree with the comment I heard about how noncatholics are not permitted to partake in communion which is the symbolic intake of the body and blood of Jesus. I believe that if a church isn't a place that a drug addict can feel welcome then it isn't a church. But if your a Catholic living in Phoenix it is a beautifully decorated church and seems to have good people. And during Lent they have the best fish fry in all or Arizona,0
"I became such a regular here  that once, upon ordering at the drive-thru window and discovering I had forgotten my wallet, the woman who works the window told me to just pay her the next time I came there (we visited every Saturday). Yes, the people who run the place are really that nice.",1
My darling husband was happy to go out in the cold on Sunday morning for a box of these tasty treats. When you think old fashion donuts (or sin on a plate) - Rainbow Donuts kicks dough-dough!,1
"After tasting these donuts, I realized that not all Rainbow Donuts are created equal.\nThese are the best I've had in the Valley.  Worth braving those early Sunday mornings to get my fix.",1
"No really - if this place goes anywhere Phoenix;  AZ for that matter will have lost something monumental.  I am not over exagerrating when I say, at the top of my voice.....THESE ARE THE BEST DAMN DONUTS YOU WILL EVERY EAT.  They are light and big, the long john with the cream down the middle is unlike anything you've tasted.  The cream isn't super disgusting sweet so it goes so well with the chocolate or maple frosting.  It is owned and operated daily by the same people.  You won't see anyone different every time you go there.  I have one drug.  Coffee.  Second drug every 2 months.  Rainbow Donuts on Cave Creek and Greenway, not all the same this is the best in the west.  Bar none.  Try it you'll see why.  \n\nTry not to cry when you go there.",1
"I love donuts. It's so hard to find a good donut these days. Luckily, I decided to \""""Yelp\"""" donuts and what do you know - Yelp comes through once again. We split a gigantic cherry fritter type donut and we still didn't finish it, mainly due to the fact we just had to try a buttermilk donut. But I did manage to scarf down the remaining piece of cherry donut later on and I enjoyed every bite. Crispy brown on the outside and moist and delicious on the inside. It's definitely something one would get a craving for every now and then. Decadent!",1
Love these Donuts Always fresh and always good. This place has consistently great Donuts and good prices. This place is in my top 2 best places to get donuts in phoenix!,1
"If you know of a better donut joint, please let me in on it. This place simply can't be beat.",1
"Pros: Great Donuts and hot chocolate, Great Service,  Friendly most of the time, Open early, Convenient location, great prices, cleanliness - for the most part, OK Customer service.\n\nCons: in the past I have seen flies - buzzing around the donuts, and they close to early in the day, when I'm out in the afternoon or late at night i am forced to take my business elsewhere - usually a convenient store with suckish donuts.\n\nwhen I start achin' for a donut, this establishment is usually my first choice.",1
"Tom: I've heard great things about this place and it is always busy when I drive by so I decided to surprise some co-workers and grab some donuts for them for breakfast.  The donuts were pretty stale.  Although they looked like they make their own donuts the display box for the donuts were running low so I could tell that I wasn't getting fresh ones which was disappointing.  I saw a sandwich called a Egg/Ham/Cheese/Bacon and had a choice of bagel or croisant and I got the croisant.  Wow.  This was just a mushy soaked thing.  Don't really know how to call it.  Just awful.  Also, what kind of soda choices are these?  RC Cola?  REALLY?  I had to get a Sunkist Orange which is ok but come on.  Pepsi or Coke.  Won't go back...",0
"I haven't met a donut I didn't like here at Rainbow Donuts.  The old-fashioned donuts, chocolate bars, and french crullers are my favorites.  They even make croissant breakfast sandwiches, which also hit the spot on the mornings that we come here.  Don't bother with Dunkin Donuts if you want authentic donuts at great prices.  The service has always been great and the young lady who works here is always smiling.  :)",1
"Oh donut, how I love thee.\n\nRainbow donuts has the best donuts (I've had thus far). I really like how they offer the classic donuts, but they also have new flavors all the time.\n\nMy favorite is the cherry fritter, and they are very generous on the size! \n\nTheir prices are good also, not too pricey, but more expensive than the grocery store. However, quality counts here!\n\nI would recommend this place to anyone who loves donuts or whoever wants to try a new place.",1
Good prices. Drive thru ... But always Fun sitting with the old folks on a Saturday morning.   Recently discontinued the Smoothies - the boy was disappointed. Fresh donuts!,1
"With the addition of the cronuts and new flavors, I have to rave about the new variety but same old taste. What can I say? Being the duke adds responsibility of ensuring this place gets the credit for best donut shop in Phoenix!\n\nNow, what makes a good donut? It has to be light and fluffy. Not light as in fat free, but light and fluffy, as you take a bite, your teeth sink right through the icing and dough. It leaves a moist chew in your mouth while allowing you to savor the flavor. Rainbow delivers this with every single donut! You got that right, I just dropped some donut knowledge up in here.\n\nI have heard many great things about cronuts. I mean I love croissants, but mixed with a donut? Oh yea, I am feeling the jive now. We tried the glazed and cinnamon. It wasn't light and fluffy, but definitely a soft crunch that packs the same old Rainbow flavor that this location only offers. Does this beat out my maple bar infatuation? Please don't make me choose! However, I will have to be so bold to say that this place keeps getting better. The family is great, the service is top notch, and it makes this Yelper proud to be Duke! Lastly, they mix the cronuts with fresh fruit if you so choose. That is definitely next on my list! Do I even need to say I will see you again Rainbow? Oh yea, probably next Sunday!",1
"BEST. DONUTS. EVER.\n\nSeriously, these are the best donuts I've ever eaten. I love donuts and I am ecstatic that I have found this place. We moved to Phoenix less than a month ago and this is a sign that we've moved to the right place.\n\nI've had a number of different types of donuts here and all have been great. While they seem simple, the glazed raised donuts are delicious. Cinnamon crumb = yum. The buttermilk bars are killer. The donuts holes are also really great. I haven't had any of what they consider \""""fancy donuts\"""", but they look amazing. I also can't wait to try the croissants after reading the reviews here.\n\nYou can't even compare Rainbow Donuts to Dunkin' Donuts. They are in a completely different class altogether. The donuts here are so light, it's dangerous. I could eat way too many. The baker's dozen is 14 donuts, but I haven't gotten that many yet. These don't keep long, which is a great sign that they aren't full of preservatives or unnecessary ingredients. The two college-aged kids that work here are super friendly, even after they've been asked a million times what each donut is. \n\nUnfortunately (or maybe fortunately for my waistline), they run out early in the day. If this place was open for a late night donut run, I would be in trouble!",1
"Ever since we moved into our place a few years back this has been our favorite and only place to go for donuts.  A very popular and renowned donut shop has since been opened in our area, but Rainbow Donuts can't be beat!  After going to the new one once or twice we realized how much better Rainbow Donuts is.  They're always friendly, always delicious, and always a very wide variety of all the flavors you'd expect.  Highly recommended!",1
"I found a thin rope in my donut!!! Not very clean, I would say!",0
I am not really sure what the hype is about. We went by in the afternoon and the place was cleaned out. We managed to get a few of what was left plus donut holes (my fave!). The donuts tasted fine - nothing spectacular and nothing I would drive out here for. We were pretty underwhelmed *sigh*,0
"My mom, two sisters, two nieces and I went in to find a wig for my little sister, who is fighting stage 4 small cell cancer.\n\nThe lady who helped us was great about finding different wigs to try based on what my sister said she liked.  She was very kind, encouraging and sensitive.\n\nThe shop itself has ALL KINDS of wigs and hair do-dads to choose from!\n\nWether you're shopping for a costume party, some fun hair accessories or if you or a loved one is looking to feel beautiful in the midst of cancer, Wigs Amor is a great place to shop!",1
"I purchased two wigs here - the second one started looking very ratty after a few months so I took it back - I was told it was because it was a standard cap and I probably wanted a mono cap - I had no idea there was a difference.  The owner just brought a wig out and told me it looked the best (I agreed).  Had I known there was a difference, I wouldn't have chosen it.  I found another one that I liked but when I asked if I could exchange and pay the difference I was told no, they don't take them back.  Then the owner disappeared when I started asking questions, leaving me with her employee who told me she disappears all the time when there is conflict.  This owner is only interested in selling wigs and not in educating the customer or making sure they are happy.",0
"This place sucks , poor service, she never once looked at me.. just kept looking at what ever she was doing at the counter , seems like they could care less if your in the store or not... And 10$ just to try on a wig , I wouldn't pay to try clothes on I'm sure not paying to try a wig on... 10$ for each wig you try on !! Business's trying to make a buck where they shouldn't  usually end up loosing a buck.",0
"BUYER BE WARE!!!!!  I've never felt compelled to write a negative review until I did business with this store.  I went to investigate purchasing clip-in bangs before committing to cuting my own hair.  The salesperson help me to find the right color and even showed me how to clip them in.  I told her I would have to take them to my stylist to see if they could be trimmed and styled to fit my present hairstyle.  I even purchased real-hair at the cost of $230.  I checked out and brought them to my stylist to see if they would work.  My stylist said that because of the way the hair was sown she could not make them look they way I wanted.  I went to return them and was told  \""""all sales final/no exchangesl\"""".  I said I wasn't told that at time of purchase whereby the clerk immediately pointed to the very tiny print at the bottom of my tiny electronic receipt.  I said that should have been told to me at the time of purchase and please could I exchange them for something else in the store... this is alot of money.  She went behind a screen and came back and said the manager said no to the return and no  to the exchange.  I said the manager may be technically correct but her practices are deceptive and less than forthcoming.  This could have been a win-win, but she chose to say the hell with her customer.  I was mad enough that I considered printing a sign and sitting in front of her store - she's lucky the weather is too hot right now.",0
Awful place with deceptive business practices.  Please see my review below.,0
"Atomic is the best place in town for all your comic needs.  They always order a decent number of new releases so you shouldn't have a problem getting a copy of any new issue.  In addition to comics they have t-shirts, posters, card games, toys, candy and all sorts of other geeky junk.  \n\nIf it's something they don't carry in their store let them know and they'll find you a copy.  The staff is friendly and happy to help you find whatever you are looking for... or make some suggestions if you're just getting in to comics.\n\n(Watch out for the swarms of kids on the weekends.  They come to hang around all day playing Pokemon and can really crowd the place.)",1
"I'm a comics purist. I want to be able to walk into a store and find my comic in pristine condition on the shelf. I want someone to roam the aisles or stack shelves and if I have questions, I want them to enthusiastic and help me. If I spend a lot of money at the counter, i want to be treated like a regular or someone worthy of respect.\n\nInstead, this is my typical experience. I walk in and I see all of  stores employees standing behind the counter and laughing and talking obnoxiously loud with one another.  I don't see anyone looking at comics. The most activity in the store is at the card table. I usually don't find my comic on the shelf because they failed to order enough comics as usual.  I walk up to the counter and wait 3 minutes until the employees finish their conversation with each other.  I ask them about the comic and this is their response: \""""Uh..which comic is that, Yeah, sorry I have no idea when they came out. I don't read Marvel or D.C. sorry.  Yeah I don't know if we will get that in. You might want to try one of our other stores dude. Oh hey, we have this sale on Crapola #1\""""  After responding no, I'm not interested \""""You sure dude, it's a great book and that's a really great price\""""\n\nThis is usually what I endure when I walk into Atomic Comics. I went to All About Books and Comics and the employees actually knew which comics arrived this week on the top of their head. They   knew which ones sold out and that was rare because the issue I wanted was usually on the shelf in multitudes. They were in great condition.  They were pretty normal everyday people who read comics as a hobby as opposed to being these weird emos who were more into manga.",0
"Found exactly what I was looking for and then some at this store.  The staff is really laid back, super friendly, and knowledgeable.",1
Own filed for bankruptcy. Locked the doors. No notice. Just left a note on the door. If you've preorder comics with Atomic Comics please contact Samurai Comics at (602) 265-8886 they have worked with Diamond to get your shipments.,0
"One evening I had hungry, loud, complaining kids in my car and, out of sheer desperation, I turned into the drive through of this completely \nnon-descript \""""berto's\"""" looking kind of restaurant.\n\nWHAT a find!  Outstanding food, fast, cheap.  Happy day, happy kids.  We've been back a few times for pick-up.  No ambience, but that's not what they are about. Expect really good really reliable old school Mexican food.",1
"Please do not ration my hot sauce! When I say I want a lot that does not mean 2 thimbles instead of one. Also please warm up your precooked ingredients before you slap them in a burrito.\n\nI went on a trip here with a Friend after a hike, we were hungry, and his out of town guest wanted to try a \""""taco stand\"""" so after driving around the shadier parts of town for a bit we found this place. \n\n I ordered my usual Chile relleno burrito. Here they fill the space around the Chile with rice cheese and sauce. However my Chile it self was cool as if they just pulled it out of the refrigerator. The one surprising thing is that I did not get sick.\n\nMy Friends seemed content with their burritos however there was an extreme shortage of hot sauce, we shared it, then we fought for it, it was a truly sad scene.",0
This place is terrible. The meat tasted like asshole.,0
"Really, I should know better...\n\nIt was late at night, we didn't feel like fast food burger places, and I have driven past this place millions of times. \n\nIt's in a dark scary lot too close for comfort to Greenway square. Probably not the best place for a woman to go by herself late at night, but luckily I had the husband with me.\n\nAfter looking at the extensive menu, I ordered the chili relleno plate and my husband ordered a chicken burrito, beef taco, and a horchata. \n\nI couldn't finish my chili relleno plate. (Quick lesson in Mexican cooking- when preparing anything with chilis, its a good idea to remove the majority of the seeds. Not just because of the heat, but because its NOT fun to have a mouthful of seeds.) Besides the hundreds of chewy seeds in my mouth, the chili rellenos were lukewarm. The whole plate was pretty bland, and with every bite I took I knew my stomach would be paying for it later. So I only ate half, then popped 3 tums and hoped for the best. I ended not having serious food poisoning, but I definitely felt uncomfortable all night.\n\nOn the other hand, my husband didn't think his food was too bad. His chicken burrito did  have a couple bones in it. He liked the beef taco. \n\nI might come back for a breakfast burrito. After all, it is hard to screw up an egg and potato burrito. It seems like this food would taste much better while drunk or hungover.",0
"Love Los Betos!!! It is nothing fancy, but after a night of drinking it definitely hits the spot. You don't have to be drunk to eat here, most of the food is good all the time. Personally I stick with their breakfast burritos and have never had an issue with it not being hot or cooked right.",1
"Ran through their drive through last Thursday. The employee working the window seemed to speak english perfectly but kept asking me to repeat the order. (it happens so whatever, thought nothing of it despite the fact I only ordered one item).\n\nAfter the 3rd time, he said \""""pull up\"""". I pulled up to the window and had my card ready but was surprised to see said employee chatting away on his cell phone. He didn't say anything to me, not even my total and because I was dumb enough to have my cc ready in my hand out the window, he yoinked it and promptly charged it and continued chatting away on his cell phone IN FRONT OF ME.\n\nI'm a cell phone whore just as much as the next person but I have the decency to know when and where this is appropriate. THIS WAS NOT THE TIME/PLACE, DUHHH much???\n\nI stared down said employee thinking \""""surely, he MUST be getting off the phone to actually, ya know, provide SERVICE?\"""" He eventually walked into the back out of sight, still never having said ANYTHING, not even \""""you want salsa?\"""".\n\nAt least when I go across the street to Filiberto's, they have the decency to 1) give me a bloody freaking total and 2) ask me if I want some fu***** hot sauce. \n\nI'm not expecting a 5 star level of service (I'm realistic, not stupid) but stuff like this makes me want to shove cell phones up the employee's  noses. \n\nI won't be back.",0
"Went through the drive through for lunch a few weeks back. Had been craving a carne asada burrito. \n\nIt took longer then I expected for a drive through, no big deal.\n\nTasted pretty good, I was impressed. Always glad to find a quick burrito place for those occasional cravings.\n\nLater that day went to dinner with some friends. Before I ate anything at dinner something in the belly wasn't feeling right. Started feeling bloated and slightly nauseated. Left early and went home.\n\nArrived home, ran to the bathroom. Didn't leave for 6 hours. Not going to go into detail but I was sick as hell for the next 36 hours. Both ends.\n\nNever again.\n\nUnless you're 8lbs from your ideal weight and don't care how you get there, avoid this place at all costs.\n\nFood poisoning is awful.",0
This company is good at cleaning your pockets and that's it. Terrible experience even after they were sent back to re-clean. This company does business under numerous names so check out the phone  number - buyer definitely BEWARE - awful cleaning service.,0
"Did a great job at my home. They showed up on time, did excatly what I asked and finsished in a timely manner. Totally recommend them to otheres.",1
"If I a can give a ZERO I would say that it is too much.  This company will take your credit card and charge you whatever they want.  I would rather have no one in my house than these chit chatty, irresponsible and disrespectful people in my home!!! I would NEVER use them again",0
"I would not use this company again.  Do they clean well? YES.  But make sure you get your estimate in writing.  I was quoted a price then charged 3 times more than quoted.  I spoke with the owner to find out what was going on and he told me I was never quoted what I said I was..he was calling me a liar!!!!!  After a 5 minute conversation, he would not come to any agreement.  This is a dishonest company.  There are so many other businesses you could use...dont use this one!!!",0
They were friendly and prompt. Some things like the bathrooms were spotless!! The inside of the cabinets had dust in them. I opened another  cabinet and there was a stain inside. For a move out clean that is pretty pricey I expected everything I asked for.,0
"I was nervous going in the first time...... Kinda like not knowing how to order at Starbucks for the first time. The girl working the counter ( Jamie) was on top of her game. Nice, friendly and walked me through the process.  I was impressed and will definitely be back.",1
I have been going to Dr Fauer for about 5 years now and I think he's great!  He takes the time to actually talk to you about what's going on. He doesn't rush in and do a 2 minute assessment.,1
"I can never for the life of me get some one to help me when I go to this Petco. Theres always one person at the register but there is no one working the floor.

"I have been coming to this Petco for 2 years....   The only thing good about this place is the store manager but even as nice as she was.... it didnt make up for what happened.\nI took my dog in to get groomed.  They were understaffed (which nobody told me about when I dropped him of for his appointment.)  so I had to wait longer. Nobody told me it was going to be 2 hours longer than what I was told so I tried to be patient.  Waited.  Waited... I was ignore.....would have been nice if someone had given me an estimated wait time.... then again...they had the first time and look how that worked out.    But I was still keeping my cool.  Hey...things happen.  Then a man walks in with 2 dogs... didnt have an appointment and asks to get both his dogs a nail trim.  NO PROBLEM!!  That's what they say.  So my dog and I are waiting for a total of 5 hours to be taken care of and this guy just walks in and is helped right away.  Understaffed.  That why I had to wait so long.  More like...not a priority.  Thanks a lot.  \n OH...BUT IM NOT DONE YET..... I took him to my work to show everyone the new \""""do\"""" and when he rolled over..his undercarrage was wayyyy uneven.   Nobody can really see it so I'm like...whatever today sucked I'm not going to worry about it... and then everyone asks why his tail is so uneven...and then my friend is petting his fur around the neck and asks why he has a dreadlock.

"Took my 5 month old puppy in for her first groom here today and I am beyond impressed!!! I was a little worried she might be nervous but she fell in love with her sweet groomer, Robin, right away. My dog is a miniature schnauzer so the cut is a little tricky and I was worried they might go to short or too long on the legs. Also, we didn't want the traditional schnauzer face so I was worried about that too. When I picked her up she looked PERFECT!! They really did a great job listening to what we wanted and making it so! She was sent home with a cute pink bandana, a little bag of treats with a big bow, and, best of all, a \""""my first groom\"""" certificate complete with her photo and gold stars for good behavior. Beyond impressed, will be going back and asking for Robin!!!",1

I'm going to try hard and not be too brutal. Eek or should just say Meow!\n\nUsually come here to pick up some 20 pound bags of Nyjer Thistle Seed for my favorite Goldfinches. They live in my super old and very tall trees that we have both in the front and back yard.\n\nAlways have a difficult time at this location. The inventory is rarely in the same place and they are usually out of the only thing we want. Wow!\n\nService is friendly once you find someone. Then it just gets frustratingly worse from there. Almost feels like we are talking Pig Latin or something.\n\nToday they tell me that the 20 pound bag is no longer an option and we would need to buy several 8 pound bags instead. Just for the record the smaller bags are much more expensive per pound and not something I care to entertain.\n\nDid I mention the person who was emptying a deadly smelling cat box in the trash can by the front door. Even though this is an outside trash can ... IT STINKS!\n\n1.5 STARS,0

"Restaurant Sinaloa is my little seaside Mexican vacation. Soon as I walk in the door, I'm literally transported. TV's playing the Spanish channel. Juke Box blaring Hispanic music at party volume.  All the signage is in Spanish. The bilingual \""""small print\"""" on the menu is English! And the seafood is fresh from the gulf of Baja! Shrimp cocktails in big glass goblets of lime juice. Options to the shrimp, if you are adventuresome, include Scallops, oysters and octopus. On the table there are six different brands of hot sauce so you can doctor-up to your content. I like the shrimp burrito. Grilled shrimp, green peppers and onions, with soupy refried beans in a fresh flour tortilla. I'm a bit of a tortilla snob. They serve the real-deal, handmade flour tortillas here. I am always surprised that notable Mexican restaurants, opt for the preservative stenched, shelf life tortillas. Then there is the shrimp soup.... It's a must try. I've yet to introduce anyone to the shrimp soup, whom did not respond with, OMG! The soup is broth style, from a fish stock reduction, and loaded with shrimp and served with a side of fresh chopped cilantro, oinions and more flour (or corn) tortillas!\n    Let me predispose you please, to NOT, expect a whole, proper,  trained staff, dining experience.  That expectation would most likely disappoint you, and distract you, from enjoying the unique ethnic food prepaired.",1
"You know that combined feeling of excitement and anticipation you get when you walk into a restaurant and it's as if you've stepped into someone else's country?  Each time I walk into Sinaloa, I feel like I've been transported into a small beach side neighborhood in Mexico.  Although I feel out of place, I'm ecstatic because I'm about to eat some of the best pacifico style seafood in the Valley.  One of my favorite dishes is the Chiccarron de Pargo.  A botana plate of lightly breaded pargo fish (pacific red snapper) that is served on top of a delicious salad that includes poached shrimp, avacados and orange slices.  The \""""cherry on top\"""" of this dish are the 2 large bacon wrapped peppers stuffed with a cream cheese and shrimp known as \""""Toritos\"""" which are also available on the menu as an appetizer on it's own.  Oh did I mention there's also a full bar!  If you're not a fan of loud jukebox playing \""""ba bam bam ba bam bam\"""" ranchero music consider ordering your food to go, which I did just a few hours ago.",1
"I have been coming here for a few years. Their Culichi is the best I have had. The battered fish tacos are very good too.  Today as I stood at the register waiting for someone to seat me. I could hear two women talking behind the counter to the left, too busy to seat me, no biggy this isn't Red Lobster. I could see one cook preparing food as his back was to me cutting something. Another guy in the kitchen area opposite him was facing me. As he stuck his thumb in his nose to dig around I about shit myself. This was not a rub a tickle away. This was a 5 second dig. This guy was working in the kitchen! with an apron on.  I was sceebed out of my mind. I will eat food off the floor but a food preparer to pick their nose, no way.  It wasn't just the gross factor but as I drove to my next choice for dinner I became enraged. I reaaaally loved their shrimp Culichi. What I saw will keep me from ever risking eating here again. I know this may happen but this guy didn't even care that I was standing there. Sorry Sinaloa, you need to look into hiring people that care. If management reads this it was 6/13/13 at apx 5:15pm.",0
This is my only 1 star rating since using Yelp. We waited 20 mins to be seated that was no big deal. After we were seated we noticed that 3 families that came in after us were seated and had drinks and chips at their tables We had not even been greeted. Waitresses avoided our table handed out checks refilled glasses to other customers. I have never felt so disrespected.,0
The food here is great.  I love mexican seafood and this place does it great.  You will not be disappointed with your food.  Parking sucks here and be prepared for a wait to sit.  But don't let that or the decor scare you off.  Get a shrimp cocktal to start and you will feel much better about everything.,1
"4 Stars until I eat more there! \nthis place is legit as it gets! Fish Taco, Pollo, Smoked Marlin, Steak! Everything was AWESOME!!!! \nAnd as stated before, I am not going long-winded on this one. If you like Legit Mexican Food......Go here now!!!!!!!!\n\n\n*****NO FIREARMS ALLOWED*****",1
"Went based on reviews. It does look divey on the outside but sometimes the best restaurants do. Walked in and wasnt greeted, shuffled around the dining room for awhile looking for a booth to sit in not covered in crumbs. A lady working in the dining room called for a waitress to come out to me. She brought chips and salsa and was nice enough. I asked for a water which came out shortly. I ordered a beer and said I needed another minute with the menu. I guess there was my mistake. At least 10 minutes later my beer and server had never materialized again.  There were only 2 other people in the restaurant. I left a dollar for the chips and salsa i ate while waiting for my waitress to return and walked out. I passed a couple employees behind the counter talking happily. Shame, the cordon bleu shrimp and smoked marlin quesadillas sounded really damn good.",0
"this store was absolutely horrible, i called mon morning 10am to see if they  had an item, i was informed they did and they would put it on hold for me till 5pm i drove an hour from my home to the store and when i got there no item none on the shelf and I stood behind a guy at the counter for over 45min while the guy tried to figure out how to help the customer. manager and another employee finally came and asked me how they could help. it took another 30 min to order what i wanted on line, and all they did was not charge me shipping which i would not have paid the begin with. i called the 800 number for complaints and gave a report they were supposed to get back to me to date 3 weeks later no response. beware of these people they dont care about customer service.",0
"I wish I hadn't grown up.\nBecause when I did...\nI went to this store which made regret ever being a Toys R Kid.\n\nThis Toys R Us could be used as the very reason why I do most of my shopping online.  The store is big and may have a huge selection, but it's woefully messy and unorganized.  And by messy I don't just mean stuff all over the place, I'm talking about dirty with cracked floor titles that are big enough to be tripped over.  I would say the store was hit by Grey Thursday/Black Friday tornado and never recovered, but it feels like it's always this way.  And it didn't take me too long to come to that conclusion.  That's because with the exception of the cashiers, I only saw three employees on the floor.  I know it was only friday in the mid-afternoon, but It's the holiday season.  How are there only three people available to help customers, restock shelves, and do any general cleaning in a store this big?\n\nUnless you have a child with you, I would avoid entering this Toys R Us at all cost.  Actually, for their safety, I would avoid bringing a child into this store, too.",0
"I ordered merchandise online with my credit card and chose in store pick up to avoid the shipping fees. When I arrived at the store, I parked in the space designated for in-store pick up. For some reason, this is located on the complete opposite side of the store from the pick up booth. No one mans this booth so I had to wait for an employee to be called. \n\nI showed him what I ordered and he went to the back. He returned about 5 minutes later and asked me again what I had ordered. This time I handed him the receipt I had brought with me. He returned a few minutes later and said the order was canceled cuz I had not picked it up quick enough. I told him that I had already paid for the items and it had not even been 10 days since the order. He said the order was canceled several days back and that I had not been charged for the items. I went home disappointed and checked my statement to find I had indeed been charged for the transaction. The employee did not seem to care one bit about the situation. When I asked if I could pick out the same products from the store, I was quickly rebuffed.",0
"Resoled motorcycle boots only lasted two rides.  When I brought them back with new soles they said they'd attach them using \""""stronger glue\"""".  When the new soles didn't fit I said forget it and asked for a refund.  They refused - even after I suggested they probably should have used the \""""stronger glue\"""" the first time.   I'll never go near that place again and wish I'd put the $50 towards the replacement boots....",0
"They also do not pay their vendors.  We took an order from them at a tradeshow, shipped the order right away and 6 plus months later we are still waiting to get a return call on the past due amount let alone any money.  They never return phone calls and their staff on the phone are just plane rude.  I would not recommend buying or selling anything to them.  Our attorney's have take over this account.",0
"Do they have everything a hardare store should have?\n\nYep.\n\nHowever.... try 'returning' anything there and you get major pushback from the staff.\n\nThe guys working the floor are helpful.  The cashiers are rather rude.\n\nOnly two stars because Home Depot is only 2 miles north and  I would rather make the short drive than put up with the attitude.\n\n\""""Attitude\"""" in a Hardware Store....  \""""go figure.\""""",0
Customer service is terrible  doubt I will ever go back,0
"They have a good selection but their store is not laid out very well.  If you don't understand the layout of this store, you can get completely lost.    Also, their customer service is hit or miss.   Went up to the customer service counter and stood right in front of a girl and she completely avoided me.  Would not look up or acknowledge me in any way.  I left and decided to try to do my return at the regular register and that worked fine.  When we were checking out, there was a long line for the single teller that was open.  A second teller opened up and, rather than saying \""""next in line, come to my register\"""", they took the last person in the line.  HELLO???!?!?  Definitely no customer service at this Ace Hardware location.",0
"First, I would like to say I love shopping here. I can spend hours looking at all their merchandise. Granted some of the merchandise is pricey. But I have found good deals here as well.\n\nThey have fantastic holiday items. I bought a costume for 8 bucks...can't beat that.\n\nNow for the reason I put 4 stars instead of 5. The post office is ridiculous! They are beyond slow and unhelpful. I went to mail a couple packages while I was having a key made. I was told they do not have tape to close the package or address labels. They do not provide any packing materials. Umm..it's a post office right? BUT, you can purchase a roll of tape. Insane! So, I took my packages and walk down to the UPS store where they happily taped my packages and had address labels!",1
"Whatever it was, I have found it at Artie's. Everyone I've met there knew what they were talking about: tools, plumbing, paint, screen doors, hardware, etc. They are 10 times better than any Home Depot in which I've been. Artie's is small enough to get around, but large enough to have everything....and I mean everything. That includes clothes, and lots of cool weird little things that you just got to have. I go out of my way to shop there.",1
"I always want to like this place but I just can't. I'm fine with paying a bit more for great customer service, but the prices are significantly higher and often the customer service is no-where to be found. It is hard to navigate this store and my experience is that finding someone to help you is often as difficult as finding what you are looking for, if not more so. Another problem is with what the store calls \""""seasonal items.\"""" In other words, be prepared for the possibility that whatever you buy will not be returnable, even if it is unopened and unused. I have found that Ace does have a different / larger selection than Home Depot or Lowe's on certain specialty items (for example, signs and doggie doors). But I still begin with Home Depot or Lowe's first and visit Ace only as a last resort.",0
"I will never shop at Artie's Ace ever again. First, I ask one of their employees for help and his response is \""""no English\"""". He literally did not speak one word of English. Second, I went to return Christmas lights and after debating amongst themselves whether they accepted returns they tell me it will be a 25% restocking fee. Nowhere on their receipt does it say that. I dispute this unclear policy which they did not like being questioned. Next, the cashier tells me the lights need to be in the box.  Okay I will box them. But wait she says the lights must be tested. Great test them. Nope need to be boxed. Needless to say at this point I am extremely frustrated and getting mad. Finally, their \""""manager\"""" comes out and he says he has heard enough of me talking to his \""""girls\"""". What is he their pimp? Btw, he looks like a pimp with his fake tan in the middle of December and bleached hair. We go back and forth which at this point he starts yelling for his employees to call the police because he is kicking me out. His store is by \""""invitation\"""" only and I am not welcome there. Fine I start walking out and we keep talking outside where he tells I cannot return the lights because I did not put them in the box and that he is not my \""""maid\"""". He makes more threats about calling the police and taking my license plate number down. Awesome! I ask him for his name. He refuses and asks for my name. I tell him it. I ask again for his name and refuses again. I ask if he is the owner. Nope. Are you the manager? Yes. Awesome! I leave with the lights and will never shop here again. Horrible customer service!",0
Disappointed. I tried to return a $2  outlet cover (wrong color match to existing )..and was told by the cashier I would need to pay a 25% restocking fee ( Yes..I did have to open the package in order to install..which is when I discovered it was the wrong color match ) \nI was purchasing another household product also...so my $2 'return' (plus some ) was going right back into thier register. \nNot the best approach for customer loyalty / PR..,0
"I will tell you what I know about Artie's Ace Hardware, Artie himself, his family, and the men and women that work at the store, which have become like family to me.  **And if anyone in these reviews should know about all of them, it is me-** because I have been personally shopping at this man's store, since 1992, and professionally shopping there on a near daily basis since 2005, spending $100,000 at the store from about 2008-2013 alone, and I have the receipts to prove it. (I own a full service repair company).  To this day, I see Artie personally on the floor of his store every day, well dressed, smiling, and \""""in the trenches\"""" with his men and women.  He talks to customers, handles concerns, and is always trying to improve the store.  He asks customers what they want, and he has personally asked me as a repair company owner/operator what I think about the store-he listens, and takes action-I often see him redo areas of the store to offer people more.  Just in the last year, he has added a Post Office, a U-Haul rental, he has redone the entire electrical section, and MORE!!  I have never asked this man for anything, and he has made me feel like family.  He recognized how often I was in his store over the years, asked who I was, took a personal interest in me, thanked me, and showed his appreciation for my business.  He also personally supports his employees by hiring and using (on a regular basis) one of their children who runs an electrical company to perform work at his store.  There is to much to list, and not enough room here for me to express my gratitude for what this man and his employees have done for myself, the men and women I've employed, and my family.  His family works there as well, and they're always moving and working hard.\n\nThe men on the floor that work at Artie's I've come to know,  care about, and respect personally over the years.  They are like family to me.  I hold their opinions in high regard and still seek advice from them, even after repairing things in multiple fields both personally and professionally over the last 18 years.  When I walk into this store, I usually see 3 of them up front that greet me with smiles, use my name, and they know exactly where things are- this continues as I walk through the store.  That is not easy to do when you work in a customer service capacity for long periods of time.  I am honored to know and call each one of these men my friends, and nothing is more important to me than my reputation, so hopefully that means something.  \n\nThe girls up front that run the register and front end are SUPERHEROES.  If you have never operated a cash register (I did this for years when I was younger at both grocery stores, gas stations, and in other stores) then you have NO IDEA what it takes to greet each person with a smile like they do every time, over and over again- one person can be yelling at you and making you lose your faith in humanity one minute, and right after that you need to genuinely smile and make someone feel welcome- over and over again, day in and day out.  The next time you see one of these girls, you should give them a tip like a waitress-and thank them- because in my opinion it's a lot harder to do what they do, and they get no tips, and are given to little respect.\n\nIn summary, every one of the people I know at this store are absolutely amazing, and I don't have enough room, time, or vocabulary to say enough nice things.  I hope you give them a shot, and if you've had a bad experience, maybe it's time to let go of that, be forgiving,  go back in and give Artie's another shot.",1
"I just want to let you guys know that you lost out on a $1500 - $2000 window re-screening job for 20 screens and 2 sliders because no one called me after I left my contact info with the woman at the service desk on Saturday, 3/29.  I try to support the local small businesses in my area but this (lack of) response was very disappointing.",0
"Very poor and non friendly service  Price are outrageous. I don't understand why people shop here unless the enjoy paying high prices and enjoy non friendly employees. But, I guess there is a store for everyone.",0
"I hate going into this store. It is very disorganized, cluttered, and impossible to get assistance. When you do get assistance they are usually very short and rude in their responses. They seem to be trying to sell everything but hardware (ie. jewelry, clothing, and lighters).  The only reason I stop here is because of how conveniently located it is to my house.",0
"This ACE Hardware has it all. If you want a blender, some dishes, candles, a Christmas Tree, you name it...they've got it. \n\nI've been in a few times over the duration of my North Phoenix living and I gotta say, Ace is definitely the place!",1
Wasted my time going there at 658pm Friday night when their website said they closed at 8pm.,0
"This is a great store full of helpful people. These days a lot of us tend to gravitate toward the big box stores, but Artie's is very competitively priced and the employees are very knowledgeable.",1
"Came in to have glasses repaired.  Ended up with cosmetic damage on the exterior of the frames.  These are $600 frames.  Repair tech offered $10 off, but frames are still damaged.

Beware of the condition of your sunglasses before you drop them off...they will surely come out in a much different condition after they are \""""fixed.\""""",0
Super friendly and attentive to the small things. Had frames repaired months ago. Went back in because a different screw came loose. The same gentleman replaced it for free and tightened up all the other screws. I know it's a small thing but most places these days would fix what they have to and move on but I really appreciated the little extra time it took to make sure I was taken care of.,1
Replaced the screws in my glasses in less than 10 minutes. $10.00\n90 day guarantee.,1
"Horrible. Tried to charge us $50 for a small fix and when we didn't want to pay that and started to leave screamed and insulted us. Don't go to this place, it is a rip off and the help is the rudest I have ever come across.",0
"Super friendly staff, good prices, and I've heard rave reviews of the live entertainment they get.  Wish they had a menu, but it's just a little place.",1
"Great place to drink and socialize.  Tons of regulars who will soon become your friends.  Bartenders are just as nice!  Very neighborhood bar.  Great jukebox or live music many nights, good prices, great patio, and even board games!  Welcome to Paradise!",1
"Sorry but I have to be the voice of dissent/reason here. Had probably the worst bar experience I've ever had at 'Paradise' last night.\n\nThe beer (Blue Moon on draft) tasted old with a strange aftertaste and even the Coke tasted nasty (all 4 of us left our glasses all but untouched after the first taste). \n\nThe worst part, though, was the service. Rather than seeming curious or concerned about the Coke that tasted like dishwater, the bartender rolled her eyes and made it seem a huge bother to try another glass (which also tasted bad). Must have been too much trouble, because there were all of about 5 other people in the whole place.\n\nYikes -- Won't be back.",0
If you like smoky low life atmosphere.. then this is the place for you.  Bartender not too friendly and it's a dump!,0
"What a great little neighborhood bar! The bartender was super friendly and great about checking back to see if I needed anything.  I love the creatively-named jello shots, and I did notice a huge stack of games to play. What a great idea! I will absolutely come back with some friends to play some Jenga or Apples to Apples. Patio is very cozy and comfortable. All in all, I am very impressed by how fun and friendly this bar is! The perfect place to watch the game, have a drink after work or hear some music. Can't wait for my next visit!",1
"This place is super fun. The bartenders are nice, quick, and the drinks are seriously cheap. But cheap isn't bad here. The best part, and the reason I love this place, besides cheap drinks and yummy French fries, is they have board games! Some are a bit outdated, (who knew I'd be so good at '80s trivial pursuit?), but it's still pretty sweet to get tipsy while playing Jenga.",1
"If you are looking for a dive bar, here you go. Nothing fancy, just good drinks, better prices and a fun atmosphere tucked away. Iguana balls are tasty as well.",1
"Tucked away nicely in a strip mall across the street from Paradise Valley Mall, its' almost hidden door keeps out most of the riff-raff.    So, what you end up with is a solid neighborhood bar in a pretty nice area.    Large, enclosed smoking patio for those so inclined, fair drink prices, assorted board and table games, the largest Jenga game I've ever seen, darts and especially Golden Tee. All of these things add up to a pretty decent place to go while away a couple of hours.",1
"Always a great place to stop in for a drink while shopping in the PV Mall area.  No one stares at you when you walk in.   Just walk in, sit down, and enjoy good service and drinks. If you are hungry, bring your own food or order delivery to the bar (they don't mind).  This is not a place for dinner and drinks... It's also not a dive bar with regulars slumped over the bar that stare at you when you walk in.\n\nCheck it out.  See you this weekend!",1
"We go to the Paradise Lounge quite often. It's very close to our home and it's the perfect laid back place for us. Gotta love the touch tunes jukebox and darts! De De always mixes up the perfect potion to get our night going! Psssst...try the sweet tart!! :-) Usually a pretty chill crowd. Saturdays they will typically have live music, never heard a bad performance here either! And if you get the munchies...you MUST order the cheese-filled pretzel! Please! With mustard to dip! It's wonderful. But really, the owners here are amazing people and their staff is the best! Thanks guys!",1
"This may be the first time I've gotten out of a place with a French tip pedicure for $25!  \n\nThe place by my house that I normally go was undergoing a remodel so I decided to check this place out with a friend.   It was really busy on a Sunday.  Pedicure was $21 (+4 for anything fancy like French tips).   We thought it would be a rushed pedicure because they were so busy but they took their time on us, prepped our little piggies, scrubbed our feet good and painted perfectly.   \n\nDownsides:  Only take cash for tips (you couldn't add it to the credit card when you pay) so we had to run to an ATM and back.   Also, I had a lot of little gnats flying around my chair, my friend didn't seem to notice any by her chair- I was the closest to the door.  So it lost a cleanliness point for me.    (all the tools/staff seemed to be sanitary)\n\nOverall, nothing too special about this place other than it was a good price..",0
"I went to this Queen's Nails for a pedicure because I had a coupon and thought I'd give it a try. I went on a slow Tues afternoon and there was only one other client there. They took me right away. \nThe positives: they had my favorite OPI polish and my pedicure looks good. The usual comfortable massage chair. \nThe negatives: Divorce Court blasting on the little tv on the wall. And the 3 employees loudly talking back and forth to each in their native tongue the whole time. \nIf you're looking for a calm, relaxing salon experience, this was not it. \nForget the coupon, I'll go elsewhere next time.",0
Not very friendly atmosphere. Felt rushed in and out. The lady did a bad job on my acrylics they are crooked and not smooth. She also hurt me when putting them on and didn't want to listen to me about how short I wanted them. She didn't say a word to me the whole time I got a full set and pedicure. Went with 4 friends and no one was very satisfied. Will not be going back.,0
This place is not very clean at all. And instead of talking to you they talk to each other the whole time. I had flies buzzing around and landing on me. Just a bad feel all together. I expected more for the area . I should have gone to my regular place or Nails 101 right down the road. They don't accept tips in debit or credit card form which is weird. I had an unpleasant experience,0
"My family has been going to Dr. Fuller for probably 7+ years. It's been very hard to find a good Optometrist with a good staff. We used to switch every few years cause the doctor was always good but no personality and the staff was off and on. Meaning sometimes good other times they couldn't even fix our glasses\n\nDr. Fuller is very nice, like to joke around with us and knows our family. Always asking us how our family is. It's not just business which helps bring some personality to the doctor. Also, he will spend the time to explain anything with our eyes. \n\nHis staff seems to turn over every few years but he seems to always hire people who are very friendly, helpful, and smile. I have never had any problem with Dr. Fuller or his staff. \n\nIf you are looking for a really good Optometrist then give him a try. Also, it doesn't hurt that his office is close by our house.",1

Then one of the stylists, an older gentleman, found it necessary to lecture me for a good five minutes on how late it was, which I thought was terribly rude.  It's a shame, because I work and live very close and was hoping to find a good salon in my area.",0
"I am between 3 and 4 stars here actually.  Every time I come to this location, they don't have the items stocked in the store that are in the advertisement.  I do love the coupons though and I like that I can find killer deals on shampoo and conditioner. \n\nIt's fun to just peruse the isles and see what they have.  The staff is usually pretty friendly but then they tell me EVERY single time I pay at the register, \""""You are approved for 2 free issues of Instyle, would you like me to have those delivered to your home?\""""--- Approved?

This store is banking on the hope they are the only place to buy what they are selling. The mgr at the cash register was not only snobbish and unhelpful but down right rude. It is 12/21/12 I know Christmas time is tough for retail employees but I was at many other retail stores today and their mgrs and employees were extremely friendly. I spend approx 1/2 hour talking to a sales assoc who was very friendly and all was good until I got to register with the mgr and I ended up walking out without purchasing anything. I then went to my car and purchased desired items on amazon while in this stores.parking lot. I know business is good this time of year and maybe this companies business is always good. But the post office and Sears also used to be the king! I could explain all the facts of the situation but I am sure it would make no difference as I am confident this is the culture of this store.,0
Went in last night and I'm not sure what there new approach is. Was greeted by a girl with bright long lime green hair and spider eyelashes . She was very nice . But I'm sorry I personally had a hard time looking at her while talking to her let alone get makeup advice . Most of the population does not go to work with makeup and hair like this .,1
I do not recommend the salon!,0
Worst service ever. Walked in and the woman rolled her eyes at me. Lol I'm not sure what I did. It was pretty empty and very clean. Walked around looking for a item for a good 15 min and no help. It want busy at all. The salons looked clean there was no staff for walk ins.,0

Upon arriving a harried guy told us to just sit anywhere, which we did.  We were catching up and after a bit realized that ~15 minutes had elapsed since we sat down.  No menus, no 'can I get you a drink', nothing.  We sheepishly looked around for our host who was nowhere to be found.  There were some occupied tables, but I would not classify it as 'busy' by any means.\nI flagged down a sweaty waiter who said that everyone had called in sick and he was doing his best to keep up.  He brought us both iced tea, which we did not order nor did we really want.

"The absence of flaw in beauty is itself a flaw.\n\nI was in Phoenix for 17 hours a couple of days ago.  \n\nIt was a perfectly warm day outside, one of those beautiful early fall days in the desert when the sun bathes everything in clear, comforting sunlight.  It felt great just walking around Kierland Commons in the warm, late afternoon sunshine. \n\nMy friend chose her favorite sushi restaurant in Phoenix, Shogun, for dinner.  We got there fairly early and sat at the sushi bar.  Looking around, I noticed that I was the only Buddhahead in the restaurant (and I'm only half-Asian).  \""""This can't be a good sign\"""", I thought.  Don't' get me wrong:  I don't believe that a restaurant operator's ethnicity must match the culinary heritage of the food he serves.  This can't be right.  Food, like human compassion and friendship, transcends race and ethnicity.  \n\nMy friend ordered most of the items off the menu.  We started with a Sunshine Roll, which was heaping mounds of spicy tuna loaded onto a modified California Roll.  The sauce for the spicy tuna was heavily mayonnaise based, which was a bit odd.  It was different, but tasty and original.\n\nThe Wahoo Sashimi in ponzu sauce with sliced cucumbers was light and delicate.  Wahoo is ono in Hawaii and is a white fish that is mild and slightly sweet.  It went well with the citrus ponzu.  \n\nThe Veggie Roll was odd in that the ingredients didn't blend together at all.  It consisted of cooked asparagus, some kind of weird takuan (pickled daikon radish) that was a bit bitter, kimpira gobou (burdock root), and shisou (mint leaf).  All the wasabi and gari in the world couldn't fix this roll. \n\nWe also had Shake Sushi (Salmon Sushi), Octopus Salad, and some edamame.\n\nThe sushi here was so far off the beaten path that the tastes were a bit off, they were almost uncomfortable to my palate.  But, it's good to try different styles of food in different settings.\n\nFood doesn't have to be perfect, or authentic, to be enjoyable.",0
"I don't expect much when grabbing lunch at a mall, but I expect better than this.  The seaweed salad was a generic overly soy tasting disappointment, the rainbow roll was barely worth eating - the shrimp on the roll tasted fishy, the fish was mealy-textured, and the rich was soft and too sticky.  The yellow tail roll suffered from the same, and we luckily were cautious enough not to try sashimi.  The miso soup was served barely like warm.  The tea was served barely luke warm. That was when we finally got service, which took a veritable eternity.  Tea refills?  Good luck on getting someone's attention for that.\n\nThe inside is a dismal, cavernous sport-bar/pool hall sort of feel.  Basically no redeeming features here.",0
"So, my husband and I went out for Sushi last night. We tried to get into Yasu, but it was just too busy. I'll blame it on the fact that it was Good Friday. Anyhow, we decided to give Shogun a try. \n\nWe entered the restaurant and was quickly shown to the sushi bar. The atmosphere was chill and relaxing. We had the Caterpillar Roll and loved it! The tuna shashimi was fresh and tasty! We even had some quail eggs and Saki. \n\nAfter finishing our roll, we realized that we lost track of time and had to get tot a birthday party in less than 25 minutes. The chef canceled the last roll and put a rush on our bill. We were able to get out in less than 5 minutes. The staff was friendly, accommodating, and FAST. We will most definitely visit Shogun again!",1
"Consistently good sushi, and great happy hour specials.",1
"Shogun is one of my favorite places to hang out and eat great sushi I have been going there since 1997. My favorite inside out rolls are the \""""Sunset Roll\"""", \""""Surfer Roll\"""" \""""Sunshine Roll\"""" \""""Sunset\"""" \""""Caterpillar Roll\"""". My favorite hand rolls would be the \""""Soft Shell Crab Hand Roll\"""" \""""Spicy Tuna Hand Roll\"""" \""""Spicy Wahoo Roll\"""". My favorite sashimi would be the yellowtail sashimi with orange roe, scallions and ponzu sauce.  If you stop by for lunch try a salmon sunomono for $10 it is very refreshing and it will fill you up.",1
"I'm giving this two stars only because our server was great.  We went for happy hour and perhaps that was the problem...the spicy tuna roll wasn't spicy and tasted like they made it yesterday.  The tuna tataki didn't taste fresh and was rather bland.  We tried the inferno roll, but i could barely taste it through all the mayo.  On a positive note, the Godzilla tails were pretty tasty.  Sorry Shogun, you can do better!",0
This is a sushi bar whose 'house specialty' is turkey salad.\n\nNeed we say more?,0
"If you like long waits, over priced sushi then this is the place to go. Their menu was laking a lot of basic Sushi. Big disappointment as I was a Sushi Fien that night but not enough to eat the sushi they brought. Also, my friend (Ms. adventurous) ordered Chicken Teriyaki... now we know that is a pretty simple dish. Not for them! A  huge bowl of white rice with a minimal amount of cold chicken and I'm not sure what kind of sauce that was but it wasn't teriyaki. Although most meals come with tea, you have to ask for it. They won't offer it. There was another item that you had to request as well. I say BooOOOooooOOOOOOooo!!!  The only thing that might be worth it is the Sake. I didn't have any but a lot of the patrons had Sake on their tables and they all seemed to be on a good one..",0
"I'm a fan.  The atmosphere is a little cold, but the staff makes you feel welcome.  The food is not the greatest (sometimes the goza (sp?) is cold) but it's consistent and flavorful.  Rob behind the bar may seem very busy but he makes time to leave the nicest notes on your receipts - \""""It was great to see you.  Have a wonderful evening.\"""" etc...\n\nThey have a great happy hour too - it allows you to try a variety of sushi at 1/2 price.  Def try the Godzilla tails.  Too much fun!",1
"so i went here for lunch with my boyfriend. the restaurant is a fairly good size and we were there around 1145. it was so slow, maybe 15 people in the whole place. we ordered 2 rolls and 45 minutes later still no rolls. i stopped the server asked him what had happened to our food and he said \""""its out of my hands\"""" i ask for a manager, he goes to the back to get her she goes to the sushi bar and this other lady comes over to us. she said well what do you want to do? get your food and go or just go? she was incredibly rude but we ended up getting the rolls about 15 minutes later and she says \""""hey thanks guys\"""". WHAT?! She was the WORST manager i have ever seen deal with a bad situation, had no realization at all for customer service, none. i know we will never ever go back here again! oh yeah and when we went to eat the food, the order was wrong! ridiculous. worst sushi place, ever!",0
"Awful service.  \n\nWe sat at the bar on a Saturday afternoon for lunch.  Probably 10 people in the place.  We were there for a half an hour with our roll card filled out and the chef never even looked at it.  We walked out and never ate.  I don't care how good the food is, I will never go in there again.",0
"I think i found my new sushi home! \n\nCame here upon recommendation from a friend. Sat at the sushi bar and had an awesome experience! The guy at the sushi bar (sushi chef?) was great. Tried out of his rolls he created and was just added to the menu, the Jelly Belly roll. Loved it! Nice spicy sauce. Also loved the Surfer roll. So effing delicious!\n\nBefore we left the sushi chef showed us a roll for some people at the other end of the sushi bar. For the more adult crowd, it was called the Big Johnson roll. Going to try that next time I go, lol. Hilarious!\n\nOur waitress was good as well. Kept drinks full and very nice. Had a great time and can't wait to introduce friends to this place!",1
"I'd sworn off Shogun for a long time.  I used to drive from Central PHX up here just for their Shogun Chicken.  The food has always been awesome, but the last three times I'd been here, the service was beyond abysmal.  One night I'd come in specifically to tie one on with a meal, but I could only manage to get the waitress's attention for three drinks.  Kinda ridiculous.  So I was pleasantly surprised on my last visit.  We were told the table would be 10-15 minutes; we were seated in five.  Iced tea and water never reached empty.  And the food was incredible, as always.  I'm not much of a fish-eater, so I can't reliably rate their sushi, but I've always loved what I've had here. The Chicken Katsu is also very good.  I hope the good service we experienced indicates a wholesale change and was not just an anomaly.  But after being this close to calling it quits on this place entirely (and I've been eating here for 15+ years), they redeemed themselves.  I really hope they keep it up.",1
"I am downgrading my last rating of 3 stars.  Some time ago, I stopped going to Shogun because of an unfortunate fish incident.  Time passed, and my husband and I recently decided to give their Happy Hour a try.  We parked the car, walked toward the door, and were hit with a bad oil smell that completely changed our minds.",0
"Not impressed and probably won't be back. I came for lunch and was immediately turned off by the lighting and d\u00e9cor. I sat down and began to peruse the menu when I saw \""""Ask server for bento box selection\"""". I asked the server and he looked at me as though I had grown a third eye. He told me they didn't have bento boxes.. I showed him the menu to which he said \""""hmff that's weird\"""". \n\nNone of the lunch items on the menu struck my fancy so I ordered the lunch special. I got the chicken katsu, it was over fried, hard and dry. The accompanying mammas roll had an overwhelming mayo flavor. And guess what? It came in a bento box. \n\nThere are a ton of great sushi spots in this area so Shogun really needs to step it up to be in line with their competition. (Thank God for Yasu's!)",0
The quality of the sashimi has been very poor the last few times we visited Shogun. We used to go once  a week but  it is doubtful if we will return anytime soon after three or four disappointing meals.,0
"I have been to Shogun twice in the last 2 months, and love the quality an portions.  Last night they had a classic rock band and threw the happy hour into full force for it..  This was the first night that I ordered anything other than \""""The cold stuff\"""", and got a teriyaki bowl along with a few pieces of nigiri.  The bowl was great...but once again the big pieces of nigiri style sushi were fantastic.  I have been to Sushi Brokers (good), RA (also good) as well as Satori and a Stingray etc...  Quality wise, Shogun is the best.  \n\nBUT\n\nAnd I love this...but the atmosphere is completely different than any of these other \""""Trendy\"""" sushi choices.  There isnt a whole lot of ZEN floating around and I think that it used to be a Hibachi style grill in the past.  Still...the bar area is a completely non-pretentious, regular bar.  They also have a sushi bar in the center...but I have just stayed at the bar the two times that I have been there.  Both times I have made great friends up there and the bartender is on top of everything.  It's dimly lit and feels like a regular working class bar with the added gift of the best sushi I have had. \n\nThey definitely take their sushi seriously.  Thats a good thing...cause so do I!  See you soon!",1
"This place is far from any Sho gun I've been to. My roll was terrible. Boring, bland, not spicy like described, too warm and avocados were brown. Tasted like grocery store sushi. Kids meal was good, tempura...veggies were good but seafood was not. I will not go back here. Hostess and other servers seemed nice, mine had no personality and did not know the menu at all. I sure miss California sushi places. Any suggestions? Phoenix area???",0
"I'm literally yelping 10 minutes after leaving this place because it really blows ass.... This is even bad by shitty strip mall sushi standards. I wanted to make it my neighborhood cheap sushi place (cuz its nice to have a cheap sushi place where they know you and you know that its not gonna be great but it'll do when you want sushi and dont wanna spend too much), but this ain't it....\n\nFirst off, I have a thing about filling out the stupid fucking check sheets all cheap, shitty sushi bars want you to fill out. NUMBER ONE, THEY HAVE ALL THE NAMES THEY MADE UP OF ALL THE SHIT THEY MAKE BUT NO EXPLANATION OF WHAT THEY ARE! WHAT THE HELL IS A SUNSHINE ROLL ANYWAY? So, I sit down, introduce myself  with a smile and ask the name of the sushi guy. I explain that I'd rather just have him tell me whats fresh and explain what kinds of things I like and would he mind just taking care of if. Simple enough in a empty goddamn sushi bar right? NO!!!! He basically tells me, if you don't fill out my stupid fucking directions, I'm not smart enough to prepare you sushi.\n\nNot wanting to be a complete butt hole and stand up, leave and go to Yasu where they have a clue (a decision I am now regretting) I smile, fill out the sheet and wait for what I expect, the same ol shit you get at every strip mall sushi bar in the country..... To cap it off, my girl and I had one cocktail each, a total of 2 nigiri orders and 4 rolls...... IT WAS $100 DOLLARS.... I HAVE NO PROBLEM SPENDING EVEN TWICE THAT MUCH. BUT FOR A CRAP VERSION OF STRIP MALL SUSHI??? NO WAY... THIS PLACE JUST BLOWS... NOT A JAPANESE GUY EXISTS WITHIN TWO BLOCKS OF THIS PLACE...THE CLOSEST JAPANESE GUY IS TWO BLOCKS AWAY AT YASU. HELL, THERE ISNT EVEN A KOREAN GUY IN THIS PLACE.... RIDICULOUS....",0
"Terrible! Service was blatantly rude and unattentative, they encourage you to sign up for their email list and then when you inquire about the emailed advertisements they won't honor them. Happy hour menu has only 3 sushi rolls, they ran out of draft beers (which were on special or $3, then charged us $5 for the same beer in a bottle), food was so-so, and they charge a 5% tax per bill for dining in. This was my second trip and I am very unimpressed, will not be returning!!!",0
"When I first moved here 15 years ago, this was a great place. It has gone downhill so much that I cannot reccomend it at all. I don't think anyone in the kitchen is Japanese, and the cooks dont know how to prepare basic dishes, such as tempura.  If you order shrimp tempura (hi $$$), you will only get 2 medium size shrimps on your plate. I asked if this was a normal amount to find on the shrimp tempura entree - and was told \""""yes only two\"""". The fried batter was oily and not crispy as one expects with tempura, and the vegetables inside were mushy and tasteless. Some of the pieces i could not even identify. The miso soup was tasty but room temperature. My chicken katsu was hard and dry, and I had to wait a long time to get a knife to cut it, as we could not find a server to help us. The service was poor. My friend enjoyed his eel sushi, but I did not sample that. I think there must be better Japanese places to eat. The place is often crowded - so I believe many patrons just don't know what good Japanese food should taste like! And the owners probably don't care about the poor quality as long as they get tourists who show up and pay their bill.",0
Shogun might be ruined for me. Me and my friend got sick after the Surfer Roll. Ugh. Haven't had sushi since. :-(,0
"The service was slow to get the food out,  but was well worth the wait. The turkey salad was wonderful. Get the big size and share with someone. The california rolls with soy paper were melt in your mouth wonderful. Will be back for sure for the same order!",1
"One of my favorite spots to grab dinner! The happy hour menu is awesome. I love their apps, especially the godzilla tails. My roommate loves their steak appetizer. And I am a huge fan of their sushi. My favorites include the shogun roll and the surfer roll. I have never eaten any of the normal non-sushi entrees, but again, my non-fish eating roommate loves their teriyaki chicken bowl. The bar staff is very friendly and efficient. Plus, there is a large TV in the bar, so if there is a sporting event on you can watch. Great place!",1
"Sushi for me is an acquired taste, one that I am still acquiring as a matter of fact. So it's pretty profound that I really enjoyed my meal here. I wasn't thrilled with the Las Vegas Roll but the Soft Shell Crab and especially the Spicy Yellowtail rolls were amazing. \nThrow in some sake bombers and a good time was had by all.",1
"Good neighborhood resturant ,  foods good , reasonable prices and better then average service, .. Paco and Sergio the chefs have been there for ever.. Bar side happy hour is not bad to.. ( upgrade all your TV's to flat screens  this is 2012 after all) LOL",1
"Food is great and sushi well priced for what you get as compared to other local sushi places. Service is decent hence the 4 stars. Otherwise, visit and enjoy especially for the sushi lovers.",1
Been going here for more than 20 years and have found it to be consistently reliable. Whether at the sushi bar or at a table we've never left disappointed. I miss the candy sushi though.,1
"My wife and I were visiting from Southern CA and had a hankering for sushi. If you appreciate fine sushi, DO NOT eat here. The restaurant is somewhat dingy, and the sushi chefs are not overly responsive. We ordered a rainbow roll that was halfway decent, but the crunchy roll was horrible and had dried noodles on top. This place deserves a pass .",0
your emails are either scams or have never worked....get it together or stop sending them out.,0
It's ok. I've come here and been wowed by the sushi then other times I can't really say either way. \n\nToday we had the miso soup and it was ok. Edamame was good though messing that up would take some work. Our teriyaki chicken is delicious and the turkey salad as well. Waitress is nice and so is everyone else.\n\nI'll give it two stars due to average food and environment. \n\nBtw everyone swears by the Godzilla tails which are just super small strips of chicken in what I liken to a buffalo sauce. Ehhh cheap if you ask me. But hey they work.\n\nI'll end with its worth a try:),0
"For the love of gawd...what crappy, sub-par sushi that is over priced. Lunch cost me and my girlfriend $70, no specials but one roll and the sushi was equivalent to a buffet style sushi at a cheap oriental place. Just to get the taste out of our mouths and get our sushi fix we went to Stingray in Old town Scottsdale and the quality, service, larger portions and lower cost turned it all around for us.",0
"Worst sushi I've ever had. I guess you get what you pay for, but I thought that since it was the \""""oldest Japanese restaurant in Phoenix\"""", that it might be good. The staff messed up our order and then when we got the missing roll, argued about it's quality (poor). I will never go here again.",0
Worst sushi I've ever had- piles of rice and imitation crab meat is all I can recall.,0
"They may be the oldest sushi bar in town, but they are an American sushi bar.  Expect the rice to be sweet, the krab mix to be sweet and the ginger to be laced with nutra-sweet.  Great if you want to take your new girl for her first California roll, but if you know Japaneese food, you will say \""""pre pak\"""".",0
My most favorite Sushi Restraunt ever!  The freshest sushi in the valley!,1
"This is a place clearly in decline.  Last visit there was about eight years ago and it was just okay then.  Decided it was time to give it another try.\n\nThe sushi from Fry's grocery store is actually a little better.\n\nThe decor is suffering, staff are mostly indifferent and it feels like no one there cares any more.\n\nMuch better sushi at Yasu Sushi Bistro near Target on Cactus.\n\nThat will be our last visit.",0
"I have such a love hate relationship with this place.  The food is great as the Surfer Roll is my favorite dish!  The problem is......the service here always seems to suck. I cannot believe that the Owners have not figured this out.  They really need to put their servers through a \""""How to be a server\"""" course.  Expect them to forget to refill your drink as well as other things that you had asked for.",0
"Have not been here in some time but the food and service is still very good. Our favorite is still the Karage Chicken and Tempura. Also shared the Pork Katsu which was a little on the hard side. \n\nThe service was very good considering we had 20 and they were very prompt to ensure your glass was filled.\n\nPrices are average and will not break the bank, ask to see if they have the dinner for 2 for $29.99 which has a appetizer 2 entrees and dessert.\n\nRestaurant is very family friendly and also nice for a quiet dinner for 2",1
"This place was so disappointing.  Maybe they are known for their sushi, but since we were there for noodles, we didn't order sushi.  Unfortunately, their udon dish that they used to have in a broth was no longer on the menu.  Our server barely spoke english so we had a language barrier and she kept insisting we order their udon dish that was stir fried.  Instead I ordered their garlic chicken dish with rice.  The chicken was OLD and you could tell it had been flash fried quite a few times.  It was rough and wouldn't even tear apart when I was trying to cut the chicken into smaller pieces.  I couldn't even finish my dish.  The husband had these pork cutlets that he said was way too sweet and extremely dry.  He, too, had a hard time cutting his pork.  We ordered our son the udon stir fry and he ate about 4 bites and said he was \""""full\"""".  So about $50 later, we left hungry and irritated and swearing we'd never come back here again.  So sad.",0
"Our family has frequented Shogun for years and we are done. The service is awful and the food has gone  downhill. While I hope that their manager Shelly has success turning it around, it is obvious that the owners don't care. Our friends are saying the same thing.",0
"If I could rate 0 stars, I would. Slow service, my Godzilla tails were cold on first delivery. On return, they were microwaved and tougher than beef jerky. The waitress did not apologize or take them off the bill. Who manages this place anyway. Used to be a favorite, but last two visits have been epic failures. \n\nSucky!!",0
"I enjoyed my recent visit to Shogun.\n\nWent around 9pm, ate at the bar.  Ordered a variety of sushi, enjoyed it all.  Highly recommend the Spicy Yellowtail Roll - Yum!",1
"Some friends and I were meeting up for sushi and this place was one of the closest sushi places to their house so we decided to stop by.  It was fairly busy when we showed up but we were seated right away which was nice.  Half of our party (the guys) were going to be showing up a little later but we went ahead and ordered some drinks and appetizers to tide us over until they showed up.  The waitress was nice if somewhat lacking in her knowledge of the menu but we didn't really mind.\n\nAfter getting our appetizers and initial drinks we really didn't see our waitress, well actually let me rephrase that, we saw her at other tables around us just not at ours.  Now, I understand that we had told her we were going to wait to order until our party shows up so it's not like we expected her to show up and take our whole order, but she wasn't even coming around to fill our water glasses or to check and see if we needed refills.\n\nOnce the guys showed up and we ordered the food came out and I was kind of underwhelmed.  None of it was bad but it was all pretty average.  The only thing memorable were the Panko Breaded Onion Rings which were fantastic.  Honestly I would go just for those babies.  As for the sushi I may try a different roll and see if that made a difference and I would definitely hope for a server who's a little more attentive.",0
"We found ourselves at this corner, craving for a quick eat. We ducked in and were impressed by the sushi chef's quick service to sushi bar patrons and the hair hygiene of all waiters & sushi chefs. The one exception was the bartender. \n\nThe yellow tail & tuna hand rolls were loaded and very tasty; we'll return!",1
"My wife stopped in and grabbed some takeout, not sure how much she looked at what they posted on their menu?  It was actually really good sushi, then I looked at the bill.  There was a 15% \""""Sushi Tax\"""". I called to see if they informed people they were adding 15%, that was a tip for the sushi chef, not the server, and she said it was posted.  I may be wrong, but I thought you were supposed to also tell people verbally that money was added to the bill.  Regardless, I was told it's posted all over the place and they have different levels (5% if sitting at sushi bar).  \n\nI find this to be a little under-handed and I'm disappointed as I enjoyed the sushi, best we've had since moving to the area.  We won't go back when restaurants aren't 100% up front about what they add on the bill.",0
"Love this place for a consistent, great menu. The Godzilla tails, huge sushi menu and saki bombers, the best. Eat in the bar or dining room, but the bar has a real neighborhood feel.",1
"Being a first timer here, we were impressed with the size and atmosphere of the restaraunt. Not your typical sushi joint. There was a separate bar area with multiple TV's showing the Monday night football game, and even some TV's in the dining area. It was busy which is always a good sign!\nOverall our sushi was pretty good. Your typical rolls were on the menu, along with some specialty rolls. Prices were decent too. \nThe best part of the night was their happy hour, 25 cent tap beers. Can't beat that!!\nI'm not sure what HH specials they run other nights, but Monday nights are definitely a winner with us.",1
"I recently attempted to transfer to this location from the Mesa location. I requested my files be transferred on a Tuesday since it is the only day I have off that matches with their office hours. I called the next week Tuesday to confirm that I could now pick up my birth control pills from this new location. They said that they did not have my records at the new location... Ok... so, now going on two full weeks just to get some birth control pills which are more expensive than their other location in Mesa. The office hours here are terrible. They aren't open on weekends, or Wednesdays and have very unusual hours the other days of the week. For example 11-7pm I believe on Tuesdays but only 8-3pm on Thursdays. For someone who works 8:30-6 this is very difficult to manage especially since I know it will take hours to get what I need.",0
"I recently moved to the area after graduating from school in Tucson, so I have no on/gyn yet. I came  here to renew my BC prescription. Everything went fine in the office, everyone was very friendly, appointment was quick an painless. I got my prescription so I could send it off to my insurance only to find out that the lady dated the prescription wrong by putting 2013 when it was 2014. So after jumping through hoops I finally received a new prescription in a different format than the first and my insurance rejected it because the doctor did not sign it. My insurance and I have both been trying to get ahold of the office for over a week now and nothing has been fixed. I would not recommend going to this clinic, the nurse practitioner does not seem to pay attention to basic details nor care about her patient's time.",0
"This is the second time I have been here and not been able to finish my food.  The first time the omelette was super dry, and the second time there was so much grease that my stomach hurt before I could finish my food.  Service has always been slow, will never go back!",0
I was there last year with my parents and extended family. Service was terrible - slow and rude. I would not go there again.,0
"This is a  mixed review with the Mystery Mansion Dinner Theater because it is housed in Coco's. \n\nI went to Coco's on Friday, August 12 for the Mystery Mansion Bedside Manor dinner the show. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. We were seated at the table furthest from the stage where most of the show took place. I won't even post any of the pictures I wasted time taking because I was always too far away or behind the actors. Not good! \n\nI paid extra for the salmon. Big mistake. It was way overcooked, hard and tasted like tuna fish. I had two small bites. I asked my friend how a person can burn broccoli and she answered, \""""The same way they burn carrots.\"""" Burned over-steamed vegetables. Really? The tossed salad in the little cup that kept spilling out as I tried to stab a piece of lettuce with my fork.,and part of the overheated, dry baked potato were the only part of the meal I ate. Bummer. \n\nOver all the night was a big disappointment for the money paid. The jokes were corny and the accents difficult to understand. Pete Swartz (female)made it bareable. She was very good in all of her roles so kudoos to her for make the night bareable.",0
Service today he was friendly crisp and efficient.  I had biscuits gravy bacon and eggs; it was a great breakfast.  My wife had the pumpkin pancakes.,1
"Waited 15 minutes for a table when half the tables were empty.  Service is awful, and the food was no better than Denny's.\nThe managers are not friendly and are in no hurry to accomidate their guests.\nWe will not be going back to this Coco's on Cactus.",0
Mystery Theater was cute and funny. Food was aweful and very bland.,0
"Horrible service. I walked in and waited. The restaurant wasn't that busy and I could see there were tables available.  The lady in front of me had 8 in her party, the manager seemed very stressed when she told him the size of her party.  He had told the lady, I don't think I have a place for you because I don't have a full staff.  This was on a Saturday morning and right before the holidays!  He saw me standing and waiting by the door while others were coming in to dine.  He said somewhat rudely \""""You can sit down and wait.  I'll be right with you\""""  I never once was  rude to him and I was waiting patiently while he assisted the lady with a party of 8.   I was shocked by his tone and so I walked out. Never eating at that Coco's!  I found a local cafe down the street and so glad I did.",0
It took almost 2 hours for lunch for a family of four.  \n\nI've wasted enough of my time with Coco's.  So this is the end of my review.,0
"First off, there were very few cars in the parking lot at dinner time on a Wednesday evening.  Red Flag.  We went in anyway to give Coco's a chance, even though I had had a bad experience the last time we went there. When my wife's soup finally arrived, it was the wrong one.  She finally got the correct flavor, but it was room temperature.  Followed by the cheeseburger and fries which were also room temperature.  When we told the waitress, she took the plates away and said \""""oh\"""".  To her credit, she did not charge us for my wife's dinner.  Upon paying the bill, the manager asked us \"""" how  was everything\"""".  We told him our experience and he was really surprised as he had prepared our food.  Coco's has lost their spark, and we will not return there in the future.",0
"Terrible Terrible service.  We were seated instantly and after 20 minutes of no acknowlegment from our waitress, we walked out.  We told the manager and she just shook her head and didn't say a word. Not even a sorry.  Think she was upset with the waitress not us, however her management skills were pretty poor as well.",0
"Visited Coco's on a Monday afternoon (parking lot was \""""unusually\"""" sparse.. counted 3 cars total.  Seating was quick, order was taken quickly, salads were delivered quickly.  The main entree didn't arrive until 30 minutes later (entire restaurant was empty except maybe 2-3 tables.  Someone must have to slaughter a cow to make 2 cheeseburgers.  My stomach felt upset for about an hour afterwards.. Service was A-ok, waitress had to be reminded to refill the tea, didn't take up completed dishes (manager took some of the dishes and said he be right back to pick up the rest  - - didn't happen.  Waitress was advised to split the checks - - didn't happen, sent her back to make the change.\n\nCoco's gong down the same path as Marie Callendars..",0
"Absolutely horrible service. We came in fairly early on a Sunday morning and the restaurant was not even that busy, lots of empty tables. My husband and I just wanted a quick bite to eat as we had to run an errand at The nearby mall. We walked in behind another couple. She put her name in and the manager seemed very frazzled stating \""""I am the only one here, there and back there!\"""" ( gesturing all over the restaurant, super awkward and very unprofessional) it is not the customers problem that you are understaffed sir. He took our name and walked away to the phone behind the cashier. He also did not state a wait time and was extremely rude. He then proceeded to take no lie 13 minutes on the phone giving someone directions to his restaurant. Meanwhile more and more people are walking in without being acknowledged. As I stood there in horror at the lack of customer service I observed a man at the bar area playing video games on his phone and excessively sneezing all over the place. That was the final straw. The place was filthy, understaffed, unprofessional and overall a horrible experience. We walked out and will never ever be back. I wish I could give negative stars bc giving one star pains me. Granted it is Cocos, which my husband stated after I slammed the door behind me, but seriously? I have had better service at Filibertos Mexican drive thru.",0
"Went there for lunch with 2 toddlers. We were seated quickly but had terrible service!  We put our orders in for the kids as quickly as possible but she seemed to lack any knowledge of side dishes for them except fries... ok no biggie, we settled with fries. Took her at least ten minutes to come back to grab our orders. Meanwhile my kid, who will eat almost anything, was not interested in the mac n cheese, which I tried and was terrible. When I placed my order I specifically said dressing on side, my salad was drenched in dressing with shredded iceberg lettuce. At this point I didn't have time to send back since the babies were getting restless but of course our waitress was no where to be found so I paid up front. The man up front happened to be the team lead so I told him about how I couldn't really eat the salad and he took 25% off our bill so that was handled well. Also, it was freezing in there!! I mentioned this to the waitress but it never warmed up, thank god I had a sweater for the baby. This is not the coco's I remember years ago. Won't be coming back here again!",0
"I will never go back again. The waitress was rude, didn't care at all, food was bla and cold then the cashier shorted me 5 dollars. My husband called and the lady on the phone didn't care at all. Said the till was short yesterday. I'm writing the company. People are stealing and it's wrong. They should be fired and put in jail. Never again. If you do go here be careful. Count your money before you leave. Don't make a mistake like I did. I learned my lesson that's for sure.",0
I'm not sure what was going on last night but we arrived around 6:45 ir so and had ordered by 6:50.  Our soup and salad came bot then 25 minutes later we were told that they were out of ravioli.  They didn't even leave a menu with us so we could re-order.  Their excuse was that a large group had come in and bow they were out of ravioli.   My husband and I were seated shead of that large group which had been out in the foyer when we came in.  \n\nI don't have a problem with their good usually (we have been here numerous times) but their service stinks and just keeps getting worse.  We will not be back unless they get new management.,0
The worst.  Rude servers and hostess' plus the service takes forever to get anything.  The place is run down and smells of food that has been sitting for a while or even gone bad.  I'd rather travel to the next location than eat here again.  It's worth the drive to go to another location.,0
Worst eating experience I have ever had.  We received our drinks right away but after that nothing about it was good.  I ordered the prime rib and my wife ordered an omelet.  After about 25 minutes the waitress came and said we were just waiting on the omelet.  I gave her a funny look and should have known that my prime rib had been sitting out for a while.  When the meals came everything on my wife's plate was stale like it was days old.  The prime rib looked and tasted the same.  The baked potato was the only thing on the plate that wasn't bad.  I will never eat at any coco's after this.  The hostess and waitress acted as if they were doing everyone a favor by being there.  They were rude to the core.  Don't waist your time.,0
Great lunch at coco's today.  Everything we ordered was delicious and service was very good.  Iceberg lettuce wedge was very good as well as BLT.,1
"I was looking forward to coming to this place as it is very close to where I live and we are always looking for a new place to try. The parking lot looked busy but we decided to give it a try and hope that we would get a good breakfast before we started our errands.  WRONG!  We actually didn't even order.  We walked in and instantly noticed how outdated the place was but we were willing to still give it a try.  We stood at the front door, waiting for a hostess but no one came over for a good 3-4 mins.  There seemed to be a decent amount of employees working but no one greeted us or acknowledged us.  A younger girl came over and without even making eye contact, just said in a very low voice, \""""hi, how many\"""", we asked how long the wait would be and she said about 10 minutes.  Weird thing is, we noticed empty tables and booths all around but didn't want to be a pain and say anything, maybe they were short staffed even though they seem to have quite a bit on staff.... We sat down and we instantly started to notice how disgusting and dirty the place was.  The floors were disgusting and we were able to see the display case for their pies.  The case was nasty.  You could clearly tell the glass was not cleaned inside or outside for quite some time.  The inside of the case where the pies were, you could see food and other things on the bottom.  We both cracked some jokes about how gross the place was and both decided to not wait to eat.  We just got up and walked out.  Do not go here, you will be just as disappointed as us.  We ended up going to the 5 & Diner that is a minute away.  We have been there about 3-4 times and have always received good service.",0
"This is what I get when I just drive by someplace and drop in.  I had a crazy hankering for Chinese last night so I deviated from my normal practice of researching a place before I go there and I am especially careful when it comes to Chinese places.  So I guess I got what I deserved when I made an impromptu stop at the Golden Wok. \n\nThis place hit the home run of bad restaurants.  Over-priced, bad service and horrible food!  I could have had PF Changs for what I paid at Golden Wok. We ordered Lettuce wraps and the food was cold and I swear the chicken must have been 3 days old. Awful.  Then I ordered Chicken Corn Soup because I love the way Abacus Inn in Phoenix makes theirs.  But again, the chicken was tough and the soup had no flavor.  Then we got our entrees.  I had Lemon Chicken.  I won't even go into how bad it was.  Just go to your local supermarket and buy a frozen sweet and sour dish and you will get the idea.  All of this cost me $50 and I drank water.  \n\nWhen you are in a location like they have you have to do something compelling to bring people to your restaurant.  Value priced food, exceptional service, or fresh ingredients.  But Golden Wok just wants to be another bad Chinese place. Just like 10,000 other places in strip malls in the valley.",0
"Nothing stood out about the place. I had lunch here with a friend that is a fan of the place. The lunch came and it was just fine. Besides being quiet and appearing clean the place looked more Japanese than Chinese to me. And the waitperson, well she was icy and abrupt. \nI'm just not feeling that it's a place I will be wanting to revisit anytime soon.",0
"Theres nothing special about this place, just so-so chinese food you can grab on the fly. Its not terrible, but i wouldnt choose to come here if i had another choice.",0
"I agree with most of the other reviews here... Nothing stands out about this place, but the food is pretty damn good. I've been here many times and have never had a bad meal.",1
Mediocre food.  Good service.  No need to return.,0
"Good food and good people.  Ordered pickup on they way between work and home without a menu.  The owner walked me through the menu - basically I asked if they had it and either they did or they would make it for me.  Cannot complain about that.  \n\nFood was good, not the best I ever had, but certainly better than most.",1
"We got take out from here, not expecting the best Chinese food in the world, but we were not expecting to get the worst! We did not like what we got at all. My white rice had a metallic taste to it, and the crab ragoons were very seafood-ish. I got a beef chow mien. The beef was ok but not great and we also got sesame chicken and they were very crunchy with little sauce. I would not recommend Chinese food from here!",0
"I went here a couple weeks ago and got the sesame chicken.  I was disappointed when I saw that it wasn't chunks of chicken, but a boneless piece of chicken that was breaded, fried, and then sliced into strips.  The sauce wasn't that good anyway.  I won't be back.",0
I am new to the area and lookng for a fanatastic Chinese restaurant that serves Mapo Tofu like I had back home!! This WAS NOT it!!  Ridiclously bland!! Thi dish should be spicy with firmented  black  beans garlic and dried chilis. NOT peas and carrots!! Will NEVERgo back!!  I can make better than this!!,0
"Food tastes alright but it's certainly not authentic. Dishes were drenched in sauce, egg rolls taste frozen. Only positive note is that it is a very clean establishment with polite service.",0
"Awful. All of the dinners came with the sauce on the side. What the?  Ordered the Golden Wok Chicken and the General Tao's Chicken. Again, sauces on the side (why?!) and not much flavor anyway. This was definitely the Bud Light of Chinese take out.",0
Great service and a nice ambience. The veg spring rolls were fresh and perfectly cooked. The vegetable kung pao and chicken schezwan was good but could have been more spicy. The spiciness levels are really low though the items were mentioned to be spicy in the menu card. I would recommend this place for their service and reasonable price.,1
"Limited stock in the labels I was looking for, but great sale going on on the clearance racks - 70% off original prices. DNKY, R Lauren, Eileen Fisher, and more all there. Grace the salesperson was helpful and ready, willing and able to help.",1
"Nice store, great sales, friendly service people.  Not the most upscale of stores at this blockbuster mall, but vastly better prices.",1
"Don't usually go to Dillard's but it was my mom's birthday and she wanted some shoes...so...Dillard's we went.\n\nSeriously, some of the best sales I have ever experienced in my life.  The place was super organized, everything labeled well and the employees were super helpful and nice and my mom is, well, a handful.  \n\nSuper happy with the selection, sale, help and display.",1
"I shop here often the selection can be some what lacking in the men's department. Beyond that this particular location continues to amazes me with there inability to remove security tags. I've been forced to drive back to the store twice in as many visits to have the security tags removed. PLUS the sales staff are all pushy and overbearing. After this last trip I'm returning everything I purchased, I'm tired of having to go back to the store just to have a tag removed considering how over my shoulder the staff was... Basically Dillard's you suck...",0
"I had a particularly good experience while Xmas shopping here last week.  After being ignored in one of the departments, I moved to another department and received exceptional service from a saleswoman whose name has escaped me.  She spent several minutes helping me select the perfect gift.  She then escorted me to another department where I was assisted by yet another helpful and patient employee.  I've received this type of service at high-end stores, but never at a Dillards.  Again, great experience.",1
"Another disgusting tasting Chinese joint in Phoenix.  My order was simple - steamed dumplings and wonton soup.  The meat inside the filling tasted like something very questionable - not pork, not chicken, not beef.  Something dark and oily and ominous.  I could not eat either dish as both tasted as if they were filled with meat from the same mystery animal.\n\nWaste of money.  So I ended up eating a small portion of a visiting relative's chicken and shrimp combo which was almost devoid of meat (might be a good thing, actually) and had absolutely no spice or kick or flavor. \n\nWill not be back.",0
"Terrible.  Terrible.  Terrible.  I ordered Chicken Chow Mein.  After waiting 40 minutes, it was delivered...with no noodles.  So I called and told them that they brought me the wrong thing.  They said they would run another one over.  \n\nThey brought the same thing again.  Apparently, according to them, chow mein does not have any noodles besides a crispy noodle.  I lived in San Francisco for 10 years, went to numerous Chinese food restaurants, and every time I ordered chow mein, it had noodles.\n\nIt was gross.  I will never order from there again.",0
Horrible food place was dirty and we found something in our vegetable low Keon that was neither vegetable or noodle. Looked like an insect and had a hard crispy outer shell. Made me and my wife want to vomit,0
"Will never order again.  Supposedly we got chicken chow mein, but I can't confirm it was actually chicken.  We also got beef with broccoli.  Broccoli seemed safe, but not sure what they grey meat was that came with it.  Never will order again.",0
Disgusting Chinese food. After the dirty diner let out that they had several major violations I knew I would never be back...,0
"I will not be ordering from here again. The only good thing I ordered was the cream cheese wontons. All of the vegetables had a really funky taste, and the garlic chicken had no garlic flavor.",0
"I ordered from this place for the first and last time tonight. The ordering process went well and I was quoted the average chinese restaurant delivery time (1 hour to an hour 15). After an hour and 40 minutes, my LUKEWARM order arrived. The lemon chicken that my boyfriend got tastes oddly like dryer sheets (it sounds sarcastic, but it's not) and my \""""mongolian beef\"""" tastes like phoenix tap-water. It's got this dirty metallic taste. Very odd..... Oh, and our cream-cheese wontons are cold and rubbery.  All this \""""great food\"""" for only $31? Yippee! I will never order from this place again and I suggest you don't either.",0
"awful tasteless food, ordered chicken chow mein chicken like rubber, sweet and sour pour and chicken no vegtables or pineapple and cherries one little bag of noodles cost me 32 dollars for an awful meal for my family ,when called woman said they are getting plenty of complaints since they went under new MGR 2 years ago NO refund mgr doesnot even speak english, get a new chef or call Gordon Ramsay in :) This place needs help for now on I will use panda express.",0
"NO NO NO, this placemakes Panda Express seem gourmet. Garbage food!",0
"This place was terrible!!  I placed an order for pick up beef fried rice, shrimp fried rice, and two egg rolls real hard order right.  When I arrived I told the high school kid behind the counter what I had ordered and he said you didn't order egg rolls.  When I said I did he went to the back and ordered them.  After 5 minutes he puth them in the bag and I handed him a Visa card, he swiped it and got an error message and said Oh we dont take this card?  So instead of confusing him I paid cash.  Took three minutes to get home, opened food up rice was barely warm and egg rolls were cold.  I will NEVER eat at this place again.",0
"The worst.  I ordered chow fun, wide noodles.  Got home and they were skinny noodles.  Called them and got some bullshit response.  They will NEVER get my business again.",0
"I ate this food for 10 years until they decided to not deliver my food and not answer the telephone. Do not order from this place. I REPEAT, DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE.",0
Ordered for delivery and after an hour and a half without my food I drove down and was told they had not even started my order. NEVER GO TO THIS RESTAURANT.,0
"Pretty bad when you order your food,  it  never shows up and they wont answer your calls.   We drive down and they say they never even started our order.   Stay away,  Chinese food is not rocket science,  this establishment is awful.\n\nLet's call it \""""No No China\""""  as you won't ever get your food.",0
"My first time here. I ordered chicken with garlic sauce, hot & sour soup and chicken rice soup (in place of sizzling rice soup, which they did not have). The chicken with garlic sauce was the best of the three. The flavor was good and had a good amount of chicken and veggies. It also has some kick to it. The rice in the chicken rice soup soaked up all the broth making it rather gross. The hot & sour soup was also a huge disappointment. The broth was thin like chicken soup - there was absolutely no thickness to it, which I'm used to. It only had a couple pieces of chicken. \n\nThe only pro was that it was open late.",0
"This is my go-to Chinese food place when I want delivery or my GF and I can't decide on a meal.\n\nThe food is consistently above average and in have NEVER experienced bad service.  Od course, I always order through GrubHub and I assume that may have something to do with it.\n\nI recommend: \nMoo-Shu Chicken\nSpring Rolls\nBrown Rice\nWonton Soup",1
Everyone out there do not order from this place it is horrible disgusting and spoiled food Go Go China is horrible horrible horrible and they will not even give my refund back and didn't even eat my food  they shouldn't even stand in business,0
No good,0
Ordered delivery and waited 90 min only to receive the least appetizing Chinese food I've ever had.,0
Ordered 2 different dishes and got the same exact thing. Couldn't tell which of the 2 considering it was comparable to a sweet and sour sauce neither of which I ordered. Fried rice? Nope. Panda express is better and that is saying a lot.,0
"Wish you could give ZERO stars. Ordered online for delivery. Over an hour later with still no food I called. The guy said they tried calling me three times to say something was wrong with my card but no one had called me! Total lie. The online order went through and there's nothing wrong with card!\n\nOk. Changed to 2 stars.  Delivery guy just showed up with food an hour and a half after i ordered. He played like he didn't know what I was talking about. I think they hurried, made food and delivered. My kids were ecstatic so we're happy now.  But the chow mein and moo goo gai pan were the exact same things.",0
"go go is a no no, dinner had no taste, fried rice was undercooked and dumplings were bland and tasteless, this was a first and a last time for us",0
"O Boy, why is it when I think i can slip in for 1 particular book, I am in here for over an hour, and find it hard to leave?  \n\nStore Lay-Out is inviting & sections are easily found.  Lots of space between isles.  It's usually quite easy to track down a store clerk for help and inquires.\n\nO, and if u sign up with there email, you get coupons on a regular basis - which reminds me: today I have a coupon for 40% off any item in the store - now, how cool is that?  Off to go use it!",1
"I'm changing my mind. I can do that. I can be conflicted. \n\nI don't know if I like this Border's anymore. I mean, its right around the corner, and its great if I need to pick something up for school or just some pleasure reading. But in the end, the employees, (except for my friend Siavonh), suck. Seriously. I've worked retail positions. I know how hard it can be to muster some enthusiasm around 4 o'clock. But its possible, so get real. Don't answer your phones with a crappy attitude, and DON'T take 15 minutes to process a return when there isn't even anyone in line. \n\nPS - I resent the fact that everyone who goes to the coffee shop here decides to move in. Don't you people have internet at home?! The coffee isn't even top tier. Why are you sitting here like shmucks? I just wanted a place to study when the library was closed, and naturally, there was nowhere to sit. Sucky.",0
"I drove by this location earlier today and was a little sad that they were closed for good... then I realized, who needs Borders when you have a perfectly good Half Price Books across the street? And a B&N nearby?",0
"Not recommended if you're not white. For me, it's the third time somebody threw out racial slurs at my group. I am beginning to think the place is for rednecks and the like. D&B bowling lanes are better.",0

"It's been a sad experience ...really!\nWent there with my girlfriend on a Saturday evening and signed up for the 15$ special that includes 'UNLIMITED PIZZA?', 2 hrs of bowling and shoes. \nThe bowling experience was regular and the guy at the counter did the needful for which I was generous with the tip.\n\nNOW THE FUN PART WAS THE 'UNLIMITED PIZZA' . I believe this was some kind of a joke.\n1. The unlimited Pizza only includes the Pepperoni and Cheese 1-topping\n options and none other. my girlfriend wanted the veggie option and guess what.....u need to pay for it seperately...\n2.  I was okay with the 1-topping... but They wouldn't give you any pizza......hahahahahahahha....U need to request them time and again and again and again and again.\n\nBeers are also expensive at 7$ a tall.\n\nAll in all we walked out of the place even before the allocated 2 hours.\n\nall in all it was a HORRIBLE experience.\n\nIf you wanna bowl try the other locations and incase you have to go this one make sure you don''t go for the unlimited pizza (lol) deal and maybe just stick to bowling.",0
"Blah, Unless you are bowling during league play , dont bother , the lanes are never oiled and the ball goes all over the lanes, not very fun when your actually trying. If you are looking to just hang out and score dosent matter.\n\nThe specials are great so its a fun time for the price , usually 10 bucks for two hours, not too shabby.\n\nBoozers Beware!- Get at least two drinks when you go to the bar, it might still take them ten minutes to make. The bar is a dreadful place with a painfully slow staff.\n\nI would much rather go to anyother location.",0
"I went here on a Friday night, and like everyone else says, it is your average bowling alley.  However, I did not care for the customer service.  I called around 2pm to book two lanes for my husband and I, as we are practicing on bowling not just hanging out like most other people.  I was told that they booked us two lanes and when I showed up at 7pm, we only got one lane, which would normally be okay, but there were clearly lanes available.  Then, the people next to us were acting quite immature and not even bowling most of the time.  They were walking down the lane and lying down on the ground.  This was annoying especially because they received two lanes for three people and when I brought this up to the front desk, they didn't have anything to say, which I feel was plain rude.  In fact, when I brought this up to the front desk, they looked at me like I was stupid and then they saw for themselves that the people next to us were walking down the oiled lane!  I don't mind having one lane, but don't tell me that I am going to have two lanes and change it just because there are kids there the same age of the staff.  I will not be returning back to this location, I am going back to Union Hills Lanes, where the customer service is awesome!",0
"I'm not a big bowler, but when friends want to bowl, I'm down. I've been to this location a few times and I'm not impressed. Where do I start?\n\nHOURS: You'll see hours listed here on Yelp, and some different ones on their website, and some on the door to the business, but when you actually go in and try to bowl the employees tell you earlier times. They informed us that management is trying to save money so they have the employees close early. It was disappointing to think we had 2 hours to bowl according to the website, then actually have less than an hour. \n\nPRICES: We bowled on a Saturday night for $15/person which included 2 hours of bowling and shoe rental. It went slightly into the fun ultimate bowling or whatever they call it here. The kind w music, fun lights, etc... We had some beer at almost $20 a pitcher, which is kind of expensive. On Tuesday, we weren't really sure what the price was. It kind of seemed like the employees weren't sure how much to charge us for only being able to bowl for 45 minutes because they were closing early. They decided between each other to charge us a total of $10.66 for everything (2 people & shoes). They didn't know how to ring it up though, which led us even further to suspect that this was just a price they made up on the spot.\n\nLOCATION: Unfortunately this alley is located in a questionable part of town. On Sat night there were some creepy looking people loitering in the parking lot. I imagine that if the INSIDE attracted better people, then the outside wouldn't be as creepy.\n\nSo...I'll probably try to find a nicer bowling alley nearby if possible and will encourage friends to go elsewhere too.\n\nIf your'e the owner or manager, please read on:\n\nI saw several ways that an employer could cut costs to save money without having inconsistent hours. \n-Turn some lights off: if people are only using 4 or 5 lanes, and you're not allowing them to be spread out even if requested (we requested a lane away from other rowdy bowlers but were given a lane RIGHT between them) then turn lights off on the other 90% of the lanes not in use. Or turn off every other one for 1/2 the building. I don't know how the electric is set up, but it might be worth getting it set up to be able to do this.\n- Cut staffing down: There were more employees working than lanes being used. That's ridiculous. 4 people working to run credit cards, hand out shoes, and spray them down after they're turned in? That's a 1 person job IF that person knows what to do. Maybe 2 are needed for safety and for the instances where one has to walk down a lane to fetch a ball or something. If the concession guy is closing early, that's a whole additional person who is being paid to stand around, but isn't available to make you money.\n-Turn off the video games early: that sucks tons of electricity and if nobody is even remotely interested in using them why have them on? You could leave a sign saying to ask an employee if you want to use the games and they'll turn them on. \n-Turn down the AC: it was freeeeezing in there. I think the temp could be turned up at least 4or 5 degrees which doesn't seem like much, but in a place that size might be a huge monetary savings.\n-Prevent theft: I think in order to prevent people suspecting they might be getting ripped off, and to prevent employee theft, you should just have listed prices and signage that gives that info in black and white. It made us uncomfortable to just have the employees throw out a price that seems random like $10.66 for 2 people for 45 minutes.\n-Offset the cost of operation by selling drinks and food! When we were there, the concession stand lights were off and they stopped serving everything at least 1/2 hour before the closing time which was an hour and a half before the posted closing time. Nobody had the opportunity to buy overpriced bowling alley food or beer. Big mistake management. Big.\n\nI never think that closing early is good for a business. You're the boss though and I guess you can do what you want, but at least have some respect for customers by listing times as \""""may vary by night and number of customers at employee discretion\"""" so that we have fair warning that we might not get to stay until the advertised times. It sucks to arrive somewhere to find that out.",0
"I have been bowling on a league at this location for 2 years.  They were bought out this last year and it sure went downhill!!!  They are short staffed, never anyone at the food counter.  Plus I saw the person behind the food counter cough directly onto food, which I told the manager.  How disgusting!!  I will NEVER have food there!  The staff just doesn't to care like it used to with the old owners.  Plus now they charge for coffee for league bowlers!  They never used to before.  It's just gone downhill!  If it wasn't for my wonderful team members, I would go to Brunswick!!!",0
"Only been here few times, not a great place to go to since the place looked rundown.  I rather drive over to 19th Ave. & Bethany Home Rd. in Phoenix or Scottsdale & Thomas in Scottsdale.  The machine is hard to figure out too.",0
"Our experience at this bowling alley was mixed - the pizza and waitress were great, but the management had severe shortcomings. \n \nJust as a background, our group loves experiencing new activities and new locations across the entire spectrum of international travel, fancy dining, stamina sports, down to bare down-to-earth deals. While we don't mind spending a few hundred dollars for a single meal, we do mind it when a vendor does not uphold their promise - it's the principle of the thing - otherwise, what's to stop vendors to perpetually bait and switch?\n \nWe made a reservation for 7 people at this bowling alley to make use of a coupon that promised unlimited bowling and unlimited pizza for $11.95. The fine-print stated that this price might vary by location. So when we made the reservation, we asked them if they would honor the $11.95 price, and they confirmed that they would. We called a second time to verify the price (since some on the group might have agreed to the outing based on the price), and once again, they reassured us that the price would hold. When we arrived for our game night, they reneged and said $15.11. We asked them to look in their appointment book and see who promised us the price on the phone. The person in charge that evening said that the initials in the appointment book were undecipherable, so that he couldn't tell which staff member promised us the price on the phone. We asked him if we could talk to a corporate number to see if they could give him the authority to honor the coupon. He gave us a number and allowed us to waste another 10 minutes only to find that the corporate office was closed (did he not know their hours?)\n \nLong story short, they had baited us, we were counting on an evening of bowling and pizza, and ended up wasting 25 minutes talking to the person-in-charge and paid them $22 more than we had budgeted for, plus gave them additional revenue via the beers and milk-shakes that we ordered.\n \nAmong other disappointments, the men's restroom did not have paper towels at the beginning of our evening and the seating for the bowlers was sub-par - far worse than other alleys we've been to.",0
Horrible service .... everything here keeps breaking down . I was here for 2 hrs and only got through 2 games because of lane issues will definitely be going to Brunswick now on.,0
Ok i love bowling. And my friends. Wanted to go so i had never been at this place i like it till i went to the bar the first lady was nice. Then i went again and the second. Bartender. Was super. Rude i was talking to someone and asking him why did they close the lil food area and she went off on me she event went to go get the cook so he could tell me. ..... but she was really. Rude cause i wasn't. Event talking to her and ill never go there again the customer. Services. Suck :(,0
"Horrible service. I waited in line a good 15 mins to ask a question with two people at the shoe reg. One which was doing nothing, when I tried to ask, they kindly asked me to wait.... so I did. When the person in front of me was done,  they skipped over me and took the next person... um hello....? I found it very disrespectful. Maybe training staff on customer service is a must... just sayin",0
"This bowling alley is very poorly run. The manager is pleasant but inept. We pre-paid one game of bowling for four of us-two adults and two children. We found out that the bumpers had to be either up or down, so all of us had to bowl with bumpers up. The bowling balls kept getting stuck. When we finished one game, we went up to let the manager know that we wanted to bowl another game. She said we were not quick enough to let her know. We needed to inform her before we finished, so she had already rented our lane to another party of bowlers. If I could give this place no stars, I would. Bowl somewhere else!",0
"Even though I booked the Tour through the internet submitted my credit card, At the end of the Tour they asked for the print out of our credit Card and they run though it old fashion way.  The Tour was ok, BUT the minute they got my CREDIT CARD number, there were 2 attempt to use my card in New York City while we were in Arizona ( one for $600- which was denied and another one for $501- from the Rite Aid in the Bronx, NY which was approved ). I do Not recommend them.",0
"Vaughan's Southwest Custom Tours saved our vacation!\n\nWhen our tour company cancelled on us last minute (literally 5pm on Sunday before our Monday Grand Canyon tour), we were nearly inconsolable.  After all, we'd planned a trip to Phoenix expressly to see the Grand Canyon and Monday was the only day we could do an all day tour!  Luckily, after making some calls, we were incredibly lucky to snag the last two spots on a tour with Vaughan's!\n\nOur tour guide, Tim, picked us up from our hotel lobby promptly at 7am, and we were off!  The scenery was captivating and ever changing on the way to the canyon.  The entire way, Tim kept up an interesting commentary about the history, the culture and the flora and fauna of Arizona.  \n\nThere were plenty of bathroom breaks along the way.  We stopped about an hour and a half in for coffee and then continued another few hours to reach a Navajo trading post, where we had a tasty lunch and a chance to see some genuine reservation-made crafts.  I found the prices and quality to be better than Scottsdale/Phoenix, so you may want to hold off on purchases until you see the stuff at the trading post!\n\nThere was an accident in front of the Park entrance that wound up costing us quite a bit of time, but Tim was a consummate professional and still made sure that we had plenty of time at the park even though it added about 2 hours to his workday.  He took us to the best parts of the park and even pointed out some wildlife.  It was absolutely gorgeous, and we even got to see sunset in the Grand Canyon, which was a real treat!\n\nPARTING THOUGHT: If you are trying to decide on a tour company for the Grand Canyon, look no further!  Vaughan's Southwest Custom Tours is extremely reliable with knowledgeable guides, comfortable vans and competitive prices.",1
My 3 children and I had the pleasure of taking this tour with Tim and a great Aussie family.\nThis otherwise long 4 hour ride was fun and entertaining. Tim kept us interested by providing us with tons of facts about AZ and joking with us the whole way.  We stopped for lunch at the Indian Reservation and did some light shopping.  The Grand Canyon was spectacular and Tim was so accommodating taking our pictures along the way.  \nTim was the highlight of the trip.  He provided the visiting Australian family with tips on visiting Sedona and showed us some great things along the way.  He had a supply of water he kept encouraging us to drink. My daughter left our camera in the car and he graciously returned it that very night.  Thanks Tim and SouthWest for providing us with a great experience.,1
"Having never seen the Grand Canyon, we wanted to take a tour. Our concierge at the Orange Tree Resort, Barbara, recommened Vaughans Southwest Custom Tours. Our guide, Princely, picked us up at our hotel at the designated time. There were 11 of us of different ages, different states and different countries in the van. Princely made sure we were all introduced and made comfortable.  We were off to the Navajo reservation for an early lunch and then on to the Grand Canyon and Sedona. The entire trip, Princely kept up an interesting commentary about the history, the Native American culture, the wildlife and the flora and fauna of Arizona.  We learned a lot. It seemed there was nothing that Princely didn't know about the area. We all commented on how special he made us feel by going out of his way to show us things we had heard about\nand a few of his special spots. Princely even helped each of us get some great photos. \nWe all agreed it was a great trip and Princely was the perfect guide.",1
"Just went on one day tour of Grand Canyon with guide Howard. The three of us were picked up at Scottsdale hotel right on time. It was a stormy day but Howard changed schedule during day to take advantage of breaks and openings in passing clouds. We were rained on only once during the day, amazing job! Really enjoyed tour and guide had a lot of history of the area and was a safe driver. His priorities were comfort,safety, and fun.  The staff at Vaughans,Laura etc. were very friendly and available 24/7 by phone or email-very accommodating. Credit card used for reservation but not charged until end of trip.",1
"I would strongly recommend Frank if you need work done. I had to get work done on my girlfriends AC. The other guys wanted to charge me 120 bucks just to \""""find\"""" the leak. Frank didn't charge a thing. he said it took him about 10 minutes to find it. The cost was less than i expected to get it fixed too. \n\nI found my future mechanic from here on out-",1
"We have been customers of Feeney Automotive for 15 years. Last December 2012 my son took his Corvette in to have the Distributor replaced.  We bought a brand new one from O'Reillys and brought it to them and had them perform the labor.  A month later the Distributor threw a code, we took it back and the technician said it was bad and that it needed to be replaced. They said it would cost about $300 in labor to replace it. We decided to wait. This week my son decided to pull the distributor out himself and fix it. He took it apart and the Distributor which should have been gold and and have a steel label GM05 RPT on it did not. It was black and the GM05 was not there. We took it  to O'Reilly and  they said this was not theirs. We called Feeney's and he told us to send him pictures which we did. He said his mechanic worked for him for 16 years and he trusted him and did not know what to say. He called me back after looking at the history and said he was positive they put the new distributor in and was confounded. I sent him more pictures and pulled all the receipts. The Distributor installed was NOT the one we bought.\n\nO'Reillys replaced the Distributor, even though they did not have to, for free. At least someone stepped up to the plate. I called other family members, and found out that my father brought in my sisters' wheelchair van a few months back and was told the cost for repair would be $35  and was billed for $90 only to find out later the work was not done. He went somewhere else for repair.  My brother brought a car to them and had several thousand dollars of work done, and again the same thing, work was said to have been done but wasn't. We believe the owner is honest but puts far to much trust into his mechanic who I honestly think is ripping people off. Stealing parts and reselling them for personal gain.  \n\nI also went to file a complaint with the BBB of Arizona and they do not have record of this company on their site.  I am so very disappointed and upset.\n\nTomorrow I will have to spend the day with my son helping fix his distributor to get his car up to spec.  I have known the owner for a long time as a friend and as a mechanic and am terribly disappointed in his response and his handling of this situation.",0
Honest mechanic shop with great labor rates. I had the best experience.,1
"This is the closest grocery store to my home and I have been going here ever since they opened some 20 years ago, so this is the place I run in and out of often. I would give them 5 start but they are the absolute last to get anything new. And I am not thrilled that they don't have a larger organic produce area. No organic apples or peaches and they are the most important items to get organic. Hmmm. Anyway, they know me, I know them and they have my back except for that glitch.",1
"I really love Safeways, this one in particular.\n\nClean, warm, and inviting stores, good selection and quality of food. Their produce is especially good. Unique deli choices.\n\nTheir service is phenomenal. Every employee acts like they actually like working there. No one seems like they were just let out on parole, unlike a few other grocery stores... Cashiers are warm and friendly. Even the produce guys ask you how you are doing and will even spontaneously carve up fresh samples of produce for you on the spot. It is like every employee is on happy pills. Kind of remind me of the characters from the move \""""Pleasantville\"""".\n\nSo why only 4 stars instead of 5? The price!! Even their sale items are more expensive than the normally priced items at Fry's, Target, or Wal-Mart. I understand the whole \""""you get what you pay for\"""" concept and it is great that they attract and keep a good work staff. But I need to stretch my dollar and feed my hungry family on a budget. So, alas, Safeway and I have an on and off relationship.",1
"Fast, friendly, and convenient. The baristas in the Starbucks rock at making coffee! The stockers are always helpful, if what you're looking for is gone, they'll check in back without hesitation or attitude. Overall, always a good experience.",1
"The staff at this Safeway is tremendous! Prices fluctuate from \""""pricey\"""" (like $3.79 for a half gallon of TruMoo Chocolate Milk) to \""""fantastic\"""" (like the 6 top sirloins for $15.60), but the cleanliness, spacious layout and the staff make up for it.",1
Great service with great people who really seem genuine. A top repair shop of AAA and very timely service,1
"I thought I would try out this location after my previous auto shop had closed and hoped, being that AAA recommended it, it would provide good honest service.  \n\nHad an oil change/maintenance check done there and was please with the service.  But when I returned to have it looked at after the engine light went on, their \""""diagnostics\"""" test was going to cost $105!  And that wouldn't have been waived if I had the service completed there!  I had to pass....free diagnostics test are available everywhere, don't be suckered!",0
"My family & I have been taking our cars to Kelly Clark Automotive for at least the past 8 years, and have had amazing service from Jim, Mitchell and their team. \n\nAs a young woman, taking my car to a repair shop can be nerve-wracking because I'm afraid I will be taken advantage of. Kelly Clark is run like a family business, and they always take care of me and are very knowledgable. \n\nThey handle all makes, models & brands of cars and have helped out my friends as well. I highly recommend Kelly Clark Automotive Specialists.",1
Simply the best staff and service by far!!! Mitchell help me with a major gas leak immediately bc dangerous gas fumes were coming into my car. Thank God they did. I didn't even have to wait around for hours bc they provided my family a ride home and picked me back up when it was done! Thanks Benny! Ur a wonderful and great guy,1
"Before I say the bad, I must say the good. Kelly Clark Auto has very nice service, they explain everything and treat you with patience and some respect. Problem is they sell you so much BS and unnecessary fixes. I took my car to a mechanic friend right before and I didn't need half of what they recommended. Kelly Clark is also quite late compared to when they say the car will be ready. But the biggest issue is the price. WOW, they are not cheap. Sorry, I ain't going back.",0
"We are restoring a 1962 Shasta Travel Trailer, and I took it here to have the bearings in the axle repacked and sealed, for long excursions, and just because it's so old. Extremely friendly & knowledgeable service people, very trustworthy and thorough. My bearing have an older type seal, and rather than putting the old one back on they searched around town for the new, old style, to do the job correctly. Seems they work on anything as well, from giant, 300-thousand dollar motorhomes to travel trailers, campers, pop-ups, etc.",1
A part here cost me $24. Found same part at Home Depot for $8. Won't be back!,0
"I popped into this place one Monday morning without being on the schedule.  They happily took me in, despite my failure to plan.  Gold Star!  I was truly grateful.  I own a pop-up, but know nothing about what it takes to maintain them.  Probably not the best idea I've ever had...but definitely feel more at east with Bell Road RV on my side.  They fixed it right up at a pretty good price and I was on my way up north by the weekend.  Four stars only because when I picked it up, the three parts guys sitting at the counter didn't offer to come out and assist in backing me up or hooking up my trailer.  I was in heels and a dress too, guess they figured it was too hot outside to move.  I don't blame them.  Will definitely be back if I need any other repairs, which I hope isn't too soon.  Thank you!",1
"40 minutes for delivery. We both got large orders, but only 1 (large) container of rice- a negative in my book.  Wanted to order shrimp w snow peas, but they only do shrimp w mixed veggies, so I got pepper steak, which was very light on the sauce w denture-soft meat -- freaking gross. Husband's Kung Pao chicken was... not. It was not spicy - he said it was more like mushroom veggie chicken - also grossly soft.  Won't be ordering here again, or finishing this meal.  Gross.",0
"Great food for very reasonable price. It has some unique things going for it. For both lunch and dinner they make small single serving dishes, called rice bowls, for very cheap. They also make pint servings that serve at least two. Then they serve quart dishes for family style eating. IMO their food is better than a lot of eat-in chinese restaurants even though their prices are cheaper. I also find that their food isn't as oily as some other places. They finally changed over from cash-only to debit/credit. I agree with others that phone-in is a good idea if it's dinner time because they do get busy with take-out orders (e.g., Sunday nights). Mongolian chicken isn't on the menu (only beef), but owners graciously make it for me anyways. I've been eating their food since '98 so I'm a obviously a big fan. This place makes it easy to support a local business.",1
"Everything tasted fine, it was just \""""off\"""".  The sweet and sour pork wasn't like anything I've had - the sauce was similar to orange or sesame sauces at other places.  Also, I'm pretty sure it was chicken, not pork.  The sesame chicken is tangy/sweet but again, not like the standard sesame I've had other places.  The egg rolls had good flavor but VERY greasy.  The crab puffs are good, filled with crab & onion with just a touch of cream cheese; not overpowered like others elsewhere.  The chow mein is good, a bit salty.  Although nothing was gross, we won't likely go again.  It was absolutely fresh, however, cooked to order!",0
The best hot and sour soup this side of town. Their egg foo young Cantonese style is unbeatable and their moshu is fantastic. The only thing I think could be improved is their egg rolls sort of taste like out of the box not. Homemade.,1
Can Soda was hot. Rice was hard not fully cooked. Chicken portion was small. Price was too high for fried rice and one entree..  Honestly panda is better and prices are more competitive .,0
"I have taken my dogs to Amigo forever, and when they told me what a bad dog I had and to never bring him back I was a little hurt. But I still took my other dogs there until I found a stray pit mix wandering the streets. I took him there to see if he had a microchip and the lady told me to immediately take him to the pound because he will undoubtedly try to kill me in my sleep. Long story short, i have a pit mix myself now who is sweet as pie and would never \""""kill me in my sleep.\"""" My thoughts are, they shouldnt go around telling people terrible things like that and focus more on HELPING the animals",0
"I went in there for the first time and it sucked! I asked to post a flier about a free dog walk event, but the lady couldn't be bothered and she shook her head at me. I know she was on the phone, but she could have waited until she was off the phone to give service. I was going to buy supplies, but forget it! I could understand them not wanting to post a flier, but they could have done something other than shake their head at me.  Never going back!",0
"My 2 year old daughter just did a week of swim lessons and I already feel more confident with her swimming skills. She knows how to go under water, jump in, and kick about the pool.\n\nThe teacher was really nice and great with little ones. They have several locations across the valley and are faily priced at $70/week.",1
"I take my 9 month old to Hubbard and we LOVE it! I feel so comfortable with the staff and it not only teaches him how to be comfortable with the water, but also teaches my husband and me how to take what he learns and apply it at home in the tub or even in the pool. The staff makes it fun with games and songs and the parents learn the right words to prepare babies to hold their breath when going under water. I think swim lessons are a must for kids here in AZ since almost everyone has a pool. And it's so great to see their progress!",1
"We signed up our 3 yr old daughter for swim lessons and initially things went well.  However after over 6 months of lessons she was not making any progress.  After speaking to managers, teachers, etc. we were given promises to work with her more and that she would be advanced to the next level within a few weeks.  Weeks turned into months and it never happened, but they were sure happy to take our $80 a month without any questions.   We put her in another swim school and she has advanced 2 levels within a few months.  Would not recommend this school to anyone.  They handled our situation very poorly and it was a waste of money.",0
"Love love love love Hubbard!  I used to nanny for an 18 month old until she was 3.  We did swimming lessons the entire time - usually with Mary Beth.  She was my favorite swim teacher, but they are all very good.  Everyone has slightly different teaching methods so I think many people just prefer their first teacher since that is who they are used to.  \n I love how the teachers are firm - with the class I was in the kids are there to learn survival skills mainly, and also beginning swim skills - so this is serious stuff!  They are firm with the parents on what they need to do to help their kids.\nWhen i had my daughter we went to hubbard before she turned 6 months old for free!  For the under 6 month crowd it's purely water acclimation - you won't be getting any amazing techniques, but it helps get the babies used to the water.  It's $70 per month for one class per week, and we just can't afford it right now - but I am waiting and waiting for the day when we have some extra cash so I can enroll my daughter!  Until then, I do the songs that I learned there in our pool and I still remember so many of the techniques from when I nannied so I apply them with my daughter.",1
"I love Hubbard Family Swim School! We started with our daughter in their free, baby splash class at 3 months old. The free class is available to babies 6 months & under is great for getting your child acclimated to & comfortable in the swimming pool. Our daughter is now almost 20 months old & just moved into the Lil Snappers Advanced class. She can climb out of the pool on her own, jump into the water without fear on her own, hold her breath & swim with minimal assistance for 5-6 seconds, blow bubbles in the water, reach down in the water to pick up objects 1.5 feet below the surface of the water, etc. It's absolutely amazing. I'm very pleased! Thus far, I can recommend Katie, Lana, Ed, & Vanessa for instructors. They are knowledgeable, great with kids, & enjoy what they do. I highly recommend Hubbard. The only thing I would change is add some additional change-after-swim rooms!",1
My two boys have grown up with Hubbard being a weekly part of their life for 5 years. They have had great instructors who have helped build them into great swimmers and great athletes.,1
"I have started to go out of my way to shop here. The produce is consistently some of the best around, the deli meats are quality, and the meat case is inspiring. I bought a pack of pork spare ribs the other day and decided to try my first barbeque with my new grill - wood chips, smoke and all. See what I mean?  So good!",1
Great prices on fruits and veggies...good coffee..decent sandwiches..would be better if they put more meat and charged you a extra dollar or so..because IT FEELS LIKE YOU ARE EATING JUST BREAD!  The toppings are very fresh though!,1
"Very nice location with really nice employees and very good, fresh produce.  You can't beat the weekly deals and the gluten free selection is quite wonderful.  I can shop gluten free and vegetarian for my daughter with ease here.",1
"My husband and I were in the area yesterday having lunch and stopped here on our way back home. Most people don't enjoy grocery shopping, but I enjoyed shopping here. We live within 5 blocks of Sunflower Market and do 99% of our shopping there, I didn't think there would be a huge difference between the 2 stores, but I was wrong. The produce at Sprouts is fantastic. I bought oranges that were the size of grapefruits and grapefruits that were the size of melons. You get more bang for your buck at Sprouts without spending more money.\n\nWhenever we are in the area again we will certainly return, I look forward to my next visit:)",1
This past Sunday we had a FUNdraiser for a non-profit which helps bring holistic practitioners to do service globally.  Sprouts donated the beverages for the event called 108 Sun Salutations Challenge.  We are so grateful for the generous donation and support of the mission of Seva Centers and it commencement event!,1
"Sprouts is like the love child of Whole Foods and Trader Joe's. It offers more of the all-around grocery store like Whole Foods, but offers prices similar to Trader Joe's, and exhibits the healthy, all-natural, organic products that both Whole Foods and Trader Joe's capitalize on.\n\nSprouts has recently become my primary grocery store mainly because of the produce section. The fruits, veggies, and herbs Sprouts offers are always fresh, in great shape, and usually cost less than other stores. I'm also in love with the quinoa with dried cranberries their deli has ready for me (well, anyone).  Sprouts also has a meat counter with seafood and a lovely bulk selection.\n\nBottom line: cheaper than Whole Foods, more selection than Trader Joe's.",1
"I LOVE this Location! Better than some of the others around town. We have been coming here since they opened and it is the main place we shop at for food. The store has come a long way and keeps getting better. They just finished the remodel and it looks Great.\n\nFantastic Produce, Meats, Fish, Seafood, Bulk items and an amazing Vitamin selection for a great value. They have both conventional and grass fed beef in the case as well as exotic game in the freezer section right in front of the butcher case. No fillers or weird stuff injected into any of the the meats like some of the bigger chain stores. Sausage made in house and very tasty. Bulk items are always fresh. You can get just the right amount you need. I cannot resist getting some of the Dark Chocolate items when I deserve a treat.\n\nI'm a vitamin freak and love the selection. If you spend $100 or more you get 10% right off the top and every few months they run a special called Vitamin Extravaganza where the whole department in 25% off everything before the 10% discount. What a deal and I feel GREAT!\n\nStore is always clean and the service is spectacular. Wednesday is Double Ad Day where the weekly specials crossover. It can get pretty crowded. Conveniently located in the same parking lot as In & Out. See you there next time!",1
"This maybe one of the worse stores in the valley. Poor attitudes among the staff, they just act like they dont want to be there. Along with bad attitudes comes with the staffs sporting very poor tattoos! You know the ones, the losers in the front of the store chain smoking.\n\nPlease enjoy standing at the deli or meat counter with one person working and 4 watching and not helping as 10 customers are waiting. \n\nThe chickens are very good, stew bones great, Veggies are picked over fast with the help in noway in a hurry to re stock. Fish, all frozen nothing fresh.\n\nBreads are a poor choice, I usually go to Bread Crafters a 1/2 block away. \n\nCandy section is good.\n\nI live a few blocks away but maybe its time to take the drive to Whole foods, same up tight, snobbish California customer base but a much better selection of products",0
I love going grocery shopping here. The people there are so nice and always helpful. If you want to buy organic produce and receive great smiles while doing it this is the place to go.,1
Sharon the cashier that waited on us was fantastic.,1
This place is crazy busy this morning when I visited.  I was only there to purchase their gift card as there's a sign on the window when I walked in.  I usually shop there at least once a week for their fresh produces and some booze to go with it.  Their cashiers are friendly and knowledgeable and can answer your questions right away.  Definitely coming back again for their great service and great location just across the streets from Paradise Valley Mall.,1
"woohoo. I love sprouts. It has almost everything and it's the perfect size because it's not overwhelmingly large. Also everyone is in a good mood... The customers, the employees, everyone. I'm always asked if I need help and the ppl that work in the soap and supplement area really know what they are talking about it seems. I just like this store. Alot.",1
"You want fresh? You want healthy? You want great sales?!  THIS is the place!  After being ripped off by the chain grocery stores, and getting inferior products, I now buy ALL my meat and fruits veggies etc. at my local Sprouts. GREAT staff, exceptional food and terrific sales; I am a FAN FOR LIFE. Thanks, Sprouts, for redefining healthy eating AND top of the line products.",1
"We buy most of our groceries here. They have fresh produce, awesome bulk foods, good meat choices, and a nice beer selection. Above all, they have great prices and awesome sales! Our 20 month old son loves going here too.",1
Great store. I'm here probably 2-3 times a week. I never have to wait more than just a minute to get checked out even on Double Ad Wednesdays. I'd like a little more variety in the pre-made meals and meat section especially the house-made sausages but it's not bad. The produce section is usually a bit insane but at least we're all eating our fruits and veggies!,1
"I like Sprouts.  Good variety, decent prices.  Two stars because the cash register clerks are so busy with chatting with each other, they lack good customer service skills.  Multiple times I've been there and it's always the same case!  \n\nWent there today and they packed my rawest with fresh veggies!!!  Gross and a cross contamination nightmare.  Going to have to keep my eye on it next time.",0
"Boycott Sprouts. They are attempting to take over lands in Albany, California which are part of a public land trust for agriculture. The land is currently being used by urban farmers to feed the poor.

"Absolutely love Sprouts! Especially when I have gift cards to use there. Always find what I need here: produce, snacks, tofu, almond milk, etc. Their deli section looks and smells fantastic! I really want to try their soups and sandwiches, one day. Overall, a great place and their sale prices are awesome.",1
"I have been taking my son here for 7 years now. The entire staff is always attentive, they typically have appointments available when you call and your child is sick and their physicals have always been very thorough.\n\nI love they have two sides to the their office - sick door and healthy door. They also have Saturday hours at their other location, so that is useful if you need them. \n\nThey do a lot of newborn/new parent education. \n\nThe doctors and staff are always friendly, they truly do like what they do and they do a great job.",1
"Really like this place! They know how to relate to kids. Always calling my daughter 'Princess' and speaking to her on her level. Like any dr's office, they can get behind from time-to-time so having the play area in the waiting room is really nice. The rooms themselves could probably use some updating but they are kid-friendly designs on the walls. \nWe've recently worked with Jennifer Valentine and she was amazing!",1
"I have been shopping at former NHL goaltender Randy Exelby's store(s) for more than 10 years now and I can't say enough good things about them.\nThey have the best selection, best prices and best service. \nThe staff is knowledgeable and helpful and always willing to give you a great deal.\nThere is no other place I would go.\nI wish that all retail could be this great and this cool.",1
"I share Tim's sentiments about Behind the Mask.  In a hockey store starved town, BTM could really rake you over the coals for their inventory.  Yet I always come out of there paying $5-$10 less than the ticketed price.  I have even gone in there needing small replacement items, willing to pay $10-$15 for it, but somehow I never end up paying.  The manager, Brian, is a goalie like myself, and I could spend all day talking about random things, equipment, or the state of the game.  I don't even bother ordering from catalogs or websites and go directly to BTM.",1
"This is my favorite hole in the wall neighborhood bar.  Whether I wear my suit and tie, or a T-shirt, I always feel comfortable here!  The drinks are cheap and strong, and the bartenters are nice too.",1
I've been here a few times and each time was fun. The drinks are cheap and the bartenders are friendly.  Good neighborhood bar where you can drink cold beer and meet new people. Casual atmosphere and relaxing.  Can't say I'm a regular but I'm working on it.,1
"I think I've found me a new dive bar. It's a little out of my neighborhood but it has the requisite dark paneling, pool and darts. I pretty much knew as soon as I walked in that I was going to like the place.\n\nDrinks are cheap and the crowd are all locals. Not attitude to be found here. I popped in on a week day so I'm keen to come back and see how it is on weekends.",1
"Debbie Wouldn't serve a 100 percent combat veteran because I had a interim license from California. I had wallet last week in ocean beach, thanks for the understanding. Complete c.unt Thanks for making a veteran feel at home. I'm 30 on the 6th so I don't look like a kid, she wouldn't even let me sit at the bar. Classy",0
"Catherine was not very pleasant, and had a very bad attitude. Maybe I'll come back, but probably not after that. Plenty of other bars to go to.",0
"Best dive bar in the neighborhood. Debbie and Taylor are the funnest bartenders you're going to find in the area. It's a dive bar, take it for what it is. But the atmosphere makes the place",1
"If you want pizza, go anywhere else, anywhere! This was some of the greasiest salty unsatisfying pizza I've ever had. There are much better pizza joints around.  I've only had there pizza but that was enough for me to never go back. The patio outside is pretty cool thats why it got 2 stars instead of one.",0
"This SNY seems smaller than most to me, and maybe that's what seems to make it better. The service here is always top notch. I honestly don't know how they do it, because it consistently only looks like 2 people are working! The guys at the front serve, answer the phone, do takeout and cashiering! They are super high energy and always seem to be in a positive mood. The cook(s) do seem to take pride in the food they put out. It can be a little slow at times, but I find it well worth it! It's not some lukewarm, been sitting around slice of pizza.\nThe food here is really good. They have huge side salads, awesome pizza (giant slices), and free breadsticks when you dine in. It can be a bit costly if you don't order from the list of specials. Keep an eye out for those and they often have coupons as well. If you call for delivery, be forewarned it's usually at least an hour until arrival, but again, worth the wait!",1
Poorly cooked pizza i will say that the people are somewhat nice when ordering but would not give this place another chance,0

"The guys here will take care of you! They are all so nice, the service is great, I've been to a couple locations and this is the cutest one! :) \nMy favorite thing to order is the gluten free pesto veggie and cheese, this pizza is killer! That and the italian dressing, can someone say amazing!?",1
If this gave me the option to do negative stars I would! I placed an order at 8:00 pm and was told it would be delivered by 9:00 pm. It's now 9:58... I have No pizza and the assistant manger had no glue how to cancel my transaction without the manger which was not answering his phone.  They had no actually way of resolving the problem Nd I'm left with a credit card charge and no food! \nDo not order from this place the service sucks and the staff was clueless!,0
Disappointed.  I wanted bread w my pasta. Was told no. Even when menu says you get w dinner. I would have even paid. Server was just plain bad. Made me feel bad for wanting to look at menu. I almost got up to leave before I got food.  That bad.,0
"I wish I had read the reviews before I ordered. I ordered the chicken Primavera. Absolutely awful! No flavor, the chicken tasted old and was breaded horribly. No crispness. Overall just an awful dish. The noodles were undercooked, Mariana was very bland. I can't get over how horrible this dish is. It's so bad I'm writing this review while eating it and the only reason I'm eating it is because I have a football game tonight and I need the carbs. I WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN",0
"I wish their was a no star. My wife and I typically carry out from Oregano's down the street(5 stars), but we gave this delivery a shot. Complete disappointment and rip off!! We should have stuck to our typical routine. We ordered a medium pizza and wings and the price was ridiculous for the quality and the portions. We paid the same amount for the delivery that we would at Oreganos and that includes beers. The cheese was rubbery and to be honest it taste the same as any other pizza place throughout the valley. Do yourself a favor and consider something else. I'm assuming that it's called Streets of NY because it's prices are up to par with NYC's cost of living. Complete let down. They must still owe Gonzo for the awful radio commercial I heard the other day. I apologize for the rant, but if it's one thing I can't stand it's flushing money down the toilet. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.",0
We only go for pizza about twice a year and this is the only place we go.  We have always had great food and great service.  Most people seem to take drive thru pickup or delivery so the inside is usually quiet and clean with great service.  (We have never done delivery service from this location),1
Had a pretty good pizza from here,0
Been to Dr. Goldenstein a few times. He is a genuinely nice man who will make a situation right if need be. I cant say the same for his rude receptionist. I would recommend people to come see him for sure. Hes taken me in last minute a few times when I was in extreme pain. He doesn't like to see people in pain.,1

Great place to buy business cards.  Very reasonable and very nice people.  Give them a try!!,1
I found her on yelp and could not resist to see what everybody was talking about . Prices were very reasonable . Alison is awesome ! Designed postcards and new business cards in a day . I could have not thought of anything better . She has a real talent .!!!,1
"If you want all-you-can-eat Chinese food, Lim's Chinese Buffet is the place.  It's been my local favorite since I was a kid, as this was the quickest and easiest place for my mom and I to dine.  Who can pass up all of the Chinese food you can fit in your gut this fast?  Lim's offers the unlimited buffet all day long or you can dine right off their menu for food made-to-order.  A large take-out plate is only $5.65 plus tax and that gets you everything on their buffet line except the drink.  If you'd rather pick and choose, be sure to let the know when you pay and they are more than happy to let pick the items you'd like.  Lim's is the best little Chinese food place in Northeast Phoenix.",1
"What is it about the anonymous Chinese buffet that draws me, like a moth to a flame, knowing full well that I will be disappointed?  I suppose the 2 or 3 good experiences I have had, ever, at any Chinese buffet, anywhere, have spawned within me an eternal optimism - that I will stumble into a beautiful buffet table full of home-cooked Chinese food, tasty and tasteful.\n\nIn reality, it seems that 98% of Chinese buffets serve the same stock dishes, with varying levels of mediocrity.  The orange chicken here was actually tasty; everything else was greasy, super salty, and, sometimes, lukewarm.  There were about 8 dishes total, with the usual fried accouterments, plus the worst sushi I have ever had in my entire life.\n\nIf you are desperate and pressed for time, this place will do - otherwise, avoid, and spend your $7 somewhere else.",0
"The only reason I'm even giving this place 1 star is cause it's the lowest I could go, if you care at all about your health you will never dine here. yeah it's super cheap but you get what u pay for, garbage",0
"If you're a pot-smoker, then you can relate to this.\nEven if you don't smoke pot you'll still relate.\n\nYou're hungry. \nNo, you're starving. \nA sudden onset of the munchies so pronounced, you're willing to eat almost anything. You pour through the fridge searching for anything, but all you can find are some leftovers from weeks ago, whose vintage looks now resemble a science experiment. \nYou know you'll hate yourself later, but God help you...you've got to eat something. Anything.\n\nIn your shark-like eating frenzy, you microwave the orange colored shit, setting the timer for double the time you normally would, reasoning how the extreme heat should kill off any new strains of life-threatening diseases.\nYou go to sleep afterward, and later awaken to the feeling you've just done something horribly wrong. \n\nIf you've ever experienced that feeling. That cathartic moment when you ask yourself; \""""why did I just do that?\""""\nYou'll experience it at least one more time if you eat here.\n\nThere's another reason I don't like this place.\nThe server, upon noticing how my plate resembled a chicken-bone graveyard of sorts, unceremoniously and very swiftly demanded I eat 'moh vegtubul'.\n\nI don't care for places where the server scolds me like my mother used to. \nIf I want to dredge up those memories, I'll go to a shrink, not Lims.",0
I have been eating here at least once a month for over 2 years. Very family friendly atmosphere with good food; good value for the money. Excellent asset to the neighborhood.,1
"Disgusting. Typical cheap, dirty, greasy Americanized Chinese food. Clean your damn restrooms! Chicken thigh meat in the chicken and broccoli. Hot and sour was pure barf. Dark.",0
HELLO CARB LOADERS!\n\nThis is your place to eat all the bagels you want.  What a yum-tastic bagel they serve.  I grew up on Chompie's bagels (this explains a lot).\nThere is something about the chewy moistness of the inside and the outside that feels and tastes toasted even though it's not. \n\nGrocery stories sell them now but they really are not nearly as good as the FRESH ones in the actual Chompie's establishment.,1
"Bought a set of Titleist golf clubs here about 6 months ago.  They just didn't work for me so decided to sell them to a broker.  Turns out the clubs were COUNTERFEIT.  Attempted to bring them into the store to get a refund but was only offered store credit.  Employee informed me that he is also losing on the deal since he has to know dispose of them.  I don't see how that would be a customer's issue, but my protests didn't matter.   I realize that they aren't a Titleist retailer, but it seems pretty unfair not to refund someone's money on counterfeit merchandise.  If they can't identify authentic equipment, I'd be extra cautious about buying any golf equipment from them (even with a store credit).",0
"Great place to get sports equipment at a decent price. With the new year comes those resolutions, and yes mine involves a little weight loss. To assist me in that are a few naughty kettlebells I picked up here at PIAS. These guys were even open on New Year's Day! \n\nThe place is a bit cluttered, but I knew to find the kettlebells over by the free weights. It looked like they'd just gotten new stock in. I was able to score a mate for my 4kg, and two 18kg for when my muscles are bored and need to move on up! \n\nThey had all sorts of items in here -- golf, bikes, stationary bikes, free weights, balls, etc. The guy behind the counter even helped me get the kettlebells to my car.",1
"I LOVE Dragon Palace. I have been going here for about 16 years.  It is your average looking neighborhood, family owned chinese restaurant. They have crazy lanterns and blue walls inside.  The staff is always very friendly and helpful.  They will make recomendations and help you out with ordering.  Lunch is awesome...you can order from a list of about 15 dishes and it comes with rice, wantons, and an eggroll all for about 9 bucks.  Dinner is great too...portions are large and perfect for sharing.  I would definetly recommend this place.",1
"Dragon Palace has become my new go-to Chinese place. After having brought home dinner from here several times, Hubby and I decided to eat in last night. It was a totally solid meal once again. \n\nThe egg drop soup is like no other I have ever had- thick, savory, and eggy, with small squares of tofu and red bell pepper. I am normally repulsed by anything with bell pepper, but this stuff is so delicious, I can totally overlook it. This time, I decided to try the won ton soup, and it, too, was awesome- savory and full of perfectly cooked won tons with little nuggets of pork inside, topped with green onions. Delicious. \n\nWe also got the crab puffs- again, these are some of the best I've had in Phoenix. They also have regular and vegetarian egg rolls. I don't think the latter are on the menu, but just ask for them. They are pretty good. \n\nI have had the house special chicken, the sweet and sour pork (minus the bell pepper, of course), and the three seas (scallops, shrimp, and chicken with snow peas and bamboo in a light sauce). All are very good, very generously portioned, and almost entirely meat. The scallops in particular were so well cooked, and next time I go I will have a scallop dish. Hubby has had three types of vegetarian entrees- the family bean curd, the veggie and egg crepes, and the mushrooms, peas, and bamboo combo- and he has enjoyed them all. \n\nThey do not deliver, but do a brisk takeout business. While we were dining, they had someone picking something up every few minutes. They are super fast with the takeout, even with special requests. You will wait only 10 minutes and have everything well packaged and ready for transport. Everything is still hot when I get home, even after more than half an hour drive. \n\nDragon Palace does not have everything on the menu that I would want in my ideal Chinese restaurant, but it comes close. Everything we have eaten has been good at the very least, and often among the best we've had in the Phoenix metro, and the prices are very reasonable.",1
House special chicken is a must. This is not a fancy schmancy place so you know the food will be good! Never have had to wait for a table. The banana thingies they give you for dessert are awesome too. I give it 5 stars because of the huge selection. Pei Wei and PF Changs are ok but they have a limited menu. And a LARGE wait!,1
"So glad to have found this place hidden in a dive of a strip mall (aren't all  places in strip malls in Phx?). Hey, it allowed me to finally find Joe's Grotto too.\n\nDragon Palace provides quick, thorough, and friendly service. Very well packaged to-go orders that keep you from having sauce spill out all over your car. I've tried a few dishes and found that they can sometimes be a bit bland, but overall it's quality Chinese food. I happen to be addicted to the Mu Shu Pork. I was surprised they wrap the crepes before packaging, but it really seems to allow the flavors to blend together and they're just plain good.\n\nI had been really disappointed with not being able to find a decent Chinese takeout place in Phoenix and Dragon Palace is just what the doctor ordered!",1
"Another Yelp Twilight Zone episode. My good friend and I look on Yelp to find a new Chinese restaurant to eat at and decide to try Dragon Palace based on these ratings, but this place is nowhere near as good as it's rated here. We were enthusiastic when we entered and felt like we walked into 1968--the interior is very retro kitsch. But looking at people's dishes on the way to our table, I could see the food was not going to be anything special. Turns out Dragon Palace is a bottom-rung Chinese restaurant: dirty plates, RUSTY teapots, sub-par ingredients, frozen vegetables, canned mushrooms, weak sauces, and the cheapest quality of fatty, gristly meats...It was so bad I sent my dinner back and asked for a refund. You'd be better off looking in the phonebook for Chinese restaurants, closing your eyes, putting your finger down on the page, and going to whatever place your finger landed on.",0
"Very nice service here, but the food was NOT good. We had multiple items from the menu, and none of it was good. The decor is somewhat depressing.\n\nAll in all, it made us wish we were eating Chinese in San Fran.",0
"I was really looking forward to finding a good Chinese food restaurant, but this was not it. The only reason this gets two, and not one star is because of the reasonable prices. 12.95/person for the Mandarin Family dinner was a good deal. However, the food was flavorless, overcooked, and the atmosphere no better. \n\nThe Wor Won Ton soup was fair. The wontons had almost no meat in them, such little meat that I thought there was nothing there until I took a closer look. \n\nThe egg rolls were overcooked and the filling was not tasty.\n\nThe fried wontons, like the soup, had almost no filling. My daughter said it looked like a tiny booger. She was right.\n\nThe shrimp with lobster sauce was fair, though too salty for my tastes. \n\nThe Sweet and Sour pork - again, overcooked, burned breading on the outside.\n\nThe House Special Chicken was just OK - the sauce was thin, runny, and also overly salty. \n\nI can't believe how many good ratings this restaurant had. I was sorely disappointed.",0
Love this place! The staff is so friendly and the food is fantastic! We live about 4 miles away and it is definitely our go to Chinese place.,1
"This place isn't bad. It's in a not so great location (tucked in the back corner of a dead shopping plaza) but the food is pretty darned good. You go inside and the decor is loud, yet drab. The walls are painted a striking teal, accompanied with a bright red. Yet it's not very well lit, and the lights look like they  need replacing. \n\nAnyways, we went there for dinner and the service was fast, and the servers were friendly. Our food came out quickly and hot. I really liked the crab puffs. Very good. It was also nice to get free hot tea and water - something I miss about a lot of Phoenix Asian based eateries. The food wasn't too greasy and tasted great. The chicken chow mein tasted a lot like Panda Express, but wasn't nearly as greasy. On average, for this time of day, the avg price for a meal was $10. Appetizers ran the gamut from $2 to $7 (on avg). \n\nI will definitely be adding this to my list of regular haunts.",1
"Bland.  My \""""hot\"""" bean curd was anything but--had to cover it in sriracha.  My husband's hot and sour soup was nothing like any hot and sour he'd ever had (and not in a good way).  The mushrooms looked canned and the chicken in the hot & sour soup was oddly rubbery.  This place over Americanizes their food and it makes me miss east coast Chinese.  We're keeping our hopes up that we'll find \""""our\"""" Chinese take out place in Phoenix, but the outlook isn't good if Dragon Palace is worthy of 4 stars!\nOne up side: ridiculous amount of food for a really good price.",0
"I can't figure out HOW we made such a mistake with this place, with such good reviews. First, it was expensive ($30 for takeout- a sesame chicken, a schezuan chicken, and fried rice... I was expecting a tab closer to $21-25 with tax.) \n\nWhen we got our takeout home, we were hopeful. All of my fellow Yelper's reviews were so glowing. Now I'm convinced that every person who rated it with 5 stars was paid to do so or came just for the tea and fortune cookies- but I'm not sure as we didn't eat in. \n\nOur food was inedible. I'm serious- and usually once I've shelled out a few bucks for something I'll at least hunker down and eat it, but instead I'd rather go hungry tonight. And my husband will eat ANYTHING, so for him not to touch his dish is pretty reassuring to me that I'm not just some crazy snob who doesn't like the food (and Chinese is never a bad choice for me, I've never given up.) The sesame chicken tasted like soggy chicken nuggets. Bland and mushy. The schezuan chicken clearly was made up of canned chicken. Tiny nondescript bits of white meat that seemed extremely processed (not fresh at all), and in some sort of spicy-ketchup sauce. The fried rice was the only thing I would consider worth eating, but was full of the same canned-chicken processed crap. I'm serious, you could almost confuse the meat here for \""""Chicken of the Sea.\"""" Same preserved flavor, and that's not the MSG talking.\n\nMaybe we ordered the wrong things, I don't know, but we literally took about 3 bites each and stared in remorse at our inedible dinner, as we contemplated calling for a refund or going out for a frozen pizza. \n\nNever again will I eat here. They were SO nice- SO nice. That's about the only remarkable thing about this place. Unlike other Yelpers, I would try ANY other place in the valley before returning for more of the same here.",0
"Like everyone has said... It is in a crapy location. The food was ok, again like others said SALTY! You almost need to take a diuretic when you get home. They will not substitute anything for you. The first and probably only time there, I got the lunch combo and asked if I could substitute the hot and sour soup for the egg drop. The Asian man started screaming, \""""no subtooshin, no subtooshin, it say no subtooshin\"""". I'm thinking damn, it was only a request. I said \""""ok\"""", then he starts in with \""""hot sour soup very special, feed 6 people, has lots of stuff in it\"""". I said ok, and he again said \""""I no subtoot, you get soup\"""". Ok. Kinda funny when I look back at it. Maybe that is why it was me and one more table for lunch.",0
"I came here for dinner a few weeks ago after reading the reviews on yelp.  I was pretty disappointed and won't be going back.\n\nI got a cup of the wonton soup as an appetizer - it was pretty pathetic.  The wontons had a dime-sized amount of meat in each one, and the broth was awful.  I got sesame chicken and wasn't impressed with that either.  \n\nTo top it off, the family that owns the place let their small child run around the entire restaurant and in and out of the kitchen screaming, with the teenaged hostess (also a family member) hardly bothering to try to quiet her down.  The waitress just went and sat at a table next to the kitchen staring at me the whole time.  What the heck?  Atmosphere gets a zero.",0
This place is delicious!!\n\n\nI have been here a couple of times. Tonight was the first time I ordered take out.  My food was ready in 10 minutes!  They packaged it up with care and added a round cookie and a sugar cookie. I ordered the orange chicken and the crab Rangoon. Both where super delicious. I have plenty left over!!  The orange chicken had nice size pieces of juicy chicken breast lightly breaded and not overly spicy. \nI do love the decor in here!!  It's quirky but that's what makes it cool!  The only bummer about take out is you don't get the wonderful banana wontons everyone raved about but I'm sure they'd throw it in if you asked!! \nLove this place!!,1
Bland watered-down tea.  Wonton soup--sorry broth; wonton ok.  \nVegetable mu-shu came in what looked like a burrito.  Had large chunks of egg in it.  More like a Mexican burrito than Chinese.\nFamily style bean curd was good & rather MSG-laden.  \n\nOne-time visit place.  Won't be returning.  Not sure what people are talking about with this restaurant being the best Chinese they've ever had.\n\nDecor & ambiance very cheap feeling also.,0
1st and only time here.   Ordered House Chicken lunch special.  Egg drop soup that came with it was way too thick.  House fried rice that also came with it was too bland.  Chicken wasn't too bad.  Not impressed enough to go back.,0
"LH's review (2012) is spot on!   This is American Chinese food in a nice atmosphere and friendly service.   The portions are generous and prices reasonable (cheap compared to other places).  You feel like you are in a Chinese American  restaurant. \n\nThey have a full bar, but I only order wine, occasionally.  Otherwise I have hot jasmine tea.  Some employees do not serve alcohol and some speak very little (no?) English.  They always get it figured out by asking someone else.  They are always very polite.\n\nYes, the little girl is always there, although I have never heard her scream.  That must've been the terrible twos; she is older now & always waves & says \""""bye\"""".   I actually look to greet her now :)\n\nThe only dish I have NOT enjoyed is the duck.  It seemed dry both times.\n\n Ask for chili/hot sauce if you want it spicier.  They have bottled hot sauce and a paste, that I love, but it's not hot.   Real Chinese is NOT spicy hot.  Szechuan is spicier.   If you want tons of spice, go elsewhere.\n\nTHIS is one of my favorite regular places.  And yes, they greet me with friendly recognition, after I came a few times.   \n\nCan't give them 5 because that means perfect.  Although they are perfect for me.",1
Love this place ! Been going here for over 10 years and average about twice a month for take away....  I'm pretty basic but love the Chicken Fried Rice (all white meat - best in valley) and Wor Wonton Soup as well as the Mongolian Beef... Just a great neighborhood restaurant with excellent service and food,1
Definately worth the drive! New favorite Chinese restaurant! A hidden gem.\nflavors are great and food is abundent and soooo reasonable for that family of 4 to go out and enjoy. a meal out.,1
"Mediocre  !!!! Overpriced save yourself the disappointment & money . I order the house special chicken & sweet & sour chicken with 3 PC egg roll . First disappointment was you can't purchase just one egg roll you have to purchase 3 @ 3.95 then if you want to upgrade to fried rice it's $6 that's crazy !!! So I passed on that I went to go pick up. As they do not deliver I got there and was presented with a bag smaller than a grocery store bag so I asked where the rest of order was the women said it's all there. I got hm & there were 4 small food containers 1 box for egg rolls , 1 box of house special chicken , 1 box sweet & sour & 1 box of rice !!!! One box for both entrees we got one small box , I was pleasantly surprised to see almond cookies a nice touch it so I thought after taking a few bites of dinner my husband & I threw out the food & I tried to eat the almond cookie & thought I was  going to chip my tooth it was do old and hard a total waste of $27.00 won't be returning.",0
"My husband and I order from here all the time. Their shrimp in lobster sauce with shrimp fried rice is, in my opinion, one of the best things on their menu!!",1
"This is a very good hidden little gem.  Ive tried every Chinese restaurant in the area and Dragon Palace is the best, and not just because their food is good but because the owner is a class act.  I came to grab a carry out order since i was in the vicinity and noticed upon approaching the door that they didn't open until 5pm (it was 4:25).  I was about to turn away in disappointment when the owner unlocked the door and asked if i was just doing carry out.  When I said yes he welcomed me inside and took my order.  That right there is just fantastic business.   Try seeing that at any other place, you would leave hungry.... especially at a certain place on tatum/thunderbird that shall not be named.  \n\nI got the house special chicken, Mongolian beef, and small wonton soup.  All of them are piping hot, fresh, and delicious.  This is my go to spot for Chinese now and they very much deserve the business.",1
"The food here is absolutely horrible. We had issues with every thing ordered except the iced tea. The food is completely unflavored, salty, and low quality.  We ordered the Mandarin family dinner which was a bundle of appetizers and entrees. The issues listed below were addressed with the manager/owner but he made excuses for the problems and did not attempt to correct. I would not recommend this restaurant in any way shape or form to anyone for fear they will be disappointed or sick.\n\nThe issues\n1. Fried wontons - cold, hard and no filling. \n2. Egg rolls - filled with old meat and tasted awful. \n3. Egg drop soup was really thick from over cooking\n4. The fried rice was full of old and new meat (complemented by the light and dark colors plus an old taste)\n5.  The Mongolian beef was the most offensive in taste - super salty and watery (the manager said that's how they do it there).\n6. The sweet and sour chicken tasted like donuts deep fried in old oil. The shell of the pastry was crisp but every piece was doughy.  Topping the chicken was a sweet glaze but did not complement the chicken. \n7. Stale fortune cookie\n\nThe dinner was finished with some odd baklava looking sweet but we were so done with the restaurant that we didn't try it.",0
"The Mongolian beef and chicken chow mein were very bland, and lacking on any major flavor.",0
I have been going here since I was a kid and it has always been delicious!  It is tucked away in the corner so don't miss it!  It is my favorite Chinese food ever.  I have tried several Chinese food places and while they all are pretty good nothing compares to Dragon Palace.,1
This is our favorite Chinese restaurant. The food is delicious and the price is right. They are fast and always quite friendly.,1
Favorite place in town I recommend the Mongolian beef or beef chow mein also hit n sour soup !!,1
"More authentic than places like Panda Express, but definitely not somewhere I'd go for quality Chinese food. I went with a big group and we ordered a variety of dishes off the menu. Overall their prices are low, but their food is rather one-dimensional. And they drench almost all of their dishes in thick sauces, making them feel greasy and unhealthy. \nWhile the service is good and they have a lot of seating for large groups, the food is nothing more than something cheap and filling.",0
"I feel bad for the low rating b/c the lady who works the drive thru late nights has been there since my hubby & I were in HS & she is super sweet but ugh, I GOT FOOD POISONING HERE! It was 1am Christmas day, or the day after if you wanna get technical, and we were all hungry after some drinking & other 'festivities\"""". Jack in the crack is 1 of the only places by us open 24 hours, so the boys went on a food run. That morning at about 5am I got so sick. I thought maybe it was the alcohol but I only had 2 glasses of wine & 1 glass of champagne, nothing crazy. When I couldn't stop throwing up that entire day, had the chills & body aches, my husband said it had to be food poisoning. I will never eat here again, or at least for a long time, no matter how hungry at 1am I am. All the pain I was in was not worth it!",0
"I have been here many time in the last few years since the JitB at cave creek and cactus turned into filiberto's. the only reason i even come to this one instead of the one at 32nd & cactus which is just as far from my current house is the food quality is better here, i have never really had a 'good' experience here but it's sorta what to expect. but several times in the past, yesterday and now today they have told me to stop and wait after the car ahead of me leaves so they can \""""fix their time/clocks\"""" I always got frustrated because of this but today it almost got domestic in the parking lot after the cars behind me started honking their horns, i yelled at the DB directly behind me that i was instructed not to pull up, after the employee \""""Julia\"""" came to the window and told us just to pull up, i demanded an explanation, and to speak to the manager, but she said said there was no explanation and hesitated to say the managers name, instead she just kept saying \""""he is working the back and can't talk now\"""" so i kept demanding until she said it. it was a terrible experience and i don't see myself returning here for a very long time.",0
"We have been here other times and I don't remember ever having an issue. We stopped here for quick breakfast on the way out of town a few days ago. I did not pay attention to the drive-through but I think it was average busy, there were like 0 to 2 other customers inside at the time...\nWe placed our order, and it kind of took a little while, which I am fine with because I understand sometimes the cashier may be new, or in training... \nHubby had gone to Costco to get gas in the mean time... he came back and we sat to wait (4 people)...\n5 minutes went by... 10 minutes went by... I asked if it was going to take long and someone told me it was because it was a big order... I do not know what the confusion was... We ran out of patience and went to check again... Finally our order was ready and it took over 15 minutes from the time in my receipt... We usually do fast food breakfast when we go out of town and it may take 15 minutes for us to be in and out, ordering, getting our food, AND eating...\n\nOur daughter thought I was making a big deal out of it, but this is called a **fast food** place, and we were in fact in a hurry...\n\nOK, so we left and I gave everyone their meal... only to find out the last one (mine) was not what I ordered... at this time I was not willing to spend much energy on this, so we didn't go back... later in the day I found out my order along with other sandwich was at the bottom of the bag... so they did mess up the order but my food was in there... I just didn't see it... I only regret that maybe someone else was missing those items in their order : (\n\nBut the unthinkable, and the one I cannot wrap my head around, is that we had ordered a box of churros and... They didn't cover them in sugar and cinnamon! that is unforgivable : P\nIt bothers me enough when they don't do it evenly and some of them have sugar/cinnamon, and some have barely any... but skipping it altogether? I would give them zero stars if I could...\n\nI know this is making me sound like I am a very demanding person, but honestly I do not think I am. \nAny of these incidents on its own would have been within my tolerance level... but delay, wrong order, no cinnamon/sugar? that was a little too much for a not so much of a morning person like me.",0
"This is unfortunate because, ask me three days ago & I would've given this place 5 stars! Maggie is our favorite bartender around. We live right down the street, frequent the bar often, bring friends, and spend money. However, on the few times we've been in when Jaxx was working, we've noticed that she often seems intoxicated and has never been overtly nice to us...fine...it's a dive bar. But being that we all either ARE or WERE bartenders, we know how customers should be treated and we know how to take care of our bartenders. On one particular occasion, a group of us ordered 6 beers and 6 shots and were charged a whopping $110! A rip-off even by Snottsdale standards! After confronting Jaxx about the bill, an altercation ensued which moved OUTSIDE of the bar and resulted in Jaxx hitting one of our female friends in the face! It's such a drag because we live in the hood and LOVE this bar. Maggie works Wed-Sat nights...I recommend avoiding this place like the plague any other time.",0
"Maggie is the bomb-dizzle. Was driving down the road with no particular place to go. As I drove saw the faint neon signs of eddies tavern... And thought to myself I must stop in for a beer. One turned to two, which turned into a local guy Dan buying me a beer. Great places are defined by the patrons, and the bad ass bartender who could probably beat the sh!t out of me, or at least when I get out of line.",1
"Dunkin Donuts inside Cobblestone carwash on the south side of Bell at the 51.  Same really good brewed coffee, good service despite the inside-a-convenience-store-that's-also-part-of-a-carwash location.  I am always worried when I go in here that I might just as well pick out something pre-made from the fridge and buy it from the convenience store, but they make that coffee quick and it tastes good, so I'll keep coming.  Cheap, too.",1
"I'm writing this regarding their post-redesign. I'm not sure they kept the same staff from before, but with this economy, I'm sure they can get better workers. I went in one Sunday morning to grab a quick breakfast for my husband and me. The line wasn't long, but it was SLOW! They had about 8 people working behind a small counter which only created chaos. When I did finally get to order my food, I ordered 2 vanilla coffees. I got my 2 sandwiches and 1 coffee. As the guy handed me my coffee, he announced to the world that he was \""""going on break now\"""" and set my other coffee cup down and walked away. As he was about to cross the counter I asked what he did with my other coffee. His reply was \""""uh, I don't know, its my break time\"""". Seriously? I polietly said it wasn't breaktime until I got my coffee. \n\nMy husband and inlaws went in not too long afterwards and got about the same service. They were sitting inside at a table and one of the workers came in with his motorcycle gear on and sat his helmet down on THEIR table and then proceeded to change into his DD shirt. They said it was a mess. Even worse , the franchise owner was there that same day and let all this happen. \n\nThe coffee is good, but I'm also paying for the service.",0
"Ahhhh, donuts. \n\nAhh, Dunkin Donuts \n\nBefore there was ever a thought of Starbucks, decades even, there was a Dunkin Donuts! \n\nEach city seemed to have it's own branded coffee and donut shops -- while Dunkin Donuts is mostly a northeast brand, SoCal had Winchell's, Seattle had Peet's and NY had Chock Full of Nuts; and, in fairness to my Canadian friend's, Tim Horton was still play hockey in the NHL. \n\nSo, why did Dunkin Donuts survive and become a national brand?  Well, I believe it had to be the way they roasted their beans. Yes, the taste of their coffee is unique and habit forming. Dunkin Donuts makes a strong but not highly caffeinated brew that makes you come back for more. \n\nThis local rollout of Dunkin Donuts in the Valley of the Sun is a good thing. And, this Dunkin Donut has some of the nicest employees who aim to please. \n\nAnd, like their competitors to the north (Tim Horton's) Dunkin Donuts is now introducing sandwiches to capture the lunch crowd which means I stop by more once each day.\n\nNice job guys!",0
"Is it me, or did the prices go way up on donuts? .99 per donut??\nAlso, The jelly ones are alot smaller.\n\nService always good when I go, just LIVID with the price increase, Krispy Kreme here I come!",0
"No more Coolatta. The Coolatta machine is broken. At all locations, apparently. Why the (*bleep*) are you still selling Coolatta if the machine's broken? Does corporate office know they're scamming customers? Horrible customer service.",0
"Oh for the days when the funny guy with the mustache was making the donuts fresh for us! I had an issue with this location limiting the menu selection on a prepaid discount offer, I contacted the corporate office and was reminded that their locations are all franchised. So, FYI there is a much better run franchise 1/2 mile west on Bell!",0
After going there every week since it reopened I was treated like dirt last week.  After being treated so poorly we were on our way and opened the bag to find an order that was wrong..... AGAIN!!!!,0
"Had the worse customer service today.  Wanted to treat the kids and grab a coffee.  The music was blasting, only one customer seated and girl at the counter was annoyed and rude.  We were placing our order and 3 more customers came in, the girl told us to hurry she wanted to close out our order and move line.  Told us to get out of the way of the register, walked away and yelled for another employee.  NO SMILE. NO THANK YOU. SHE WAS THE WORST.  We were not happy I didn't need to start my day like this!",0
Stale donuts after 4 pm. This is the third time we have gone to this location after 4 pm. Happy a new location south of this one has opened on Tatum and G'way. The least the owner can do is offer donuts at half price after a particular time. Last time for this customer.,0
Shout of to both Shandi and Elisa who are two of the most polite and friendly employees I've met in awhile! Thank you both for making my visit an awesome one!,1
"This place is a great place to see live music. I have been into the local music seen for quit some time now and there isnt one local band that hasnt played here. Great drink prices. And while they are settin up the stage between bands there are always $1 shot specials.  I usually go on a friday or sat night but they have open mic nights as well, I think thats on Monday night. This place has dart boards and pool table as well. All the bartenders are very cool and nice. I really like this place for the cheap drinks, great music and the deversity of people. Also on the weekends there is aguy who sells hot dogs and other great snack foods from a cart. I see more of this popping up around town and I love it. Giant soft pretzels( my fave),hot dogs, polish dogs, chips, etc..",1
"Joe, at the door, is great, the music is loud, the bathrooms are gross, the bartender is decent enough, the booze is reasonable (were $3 \""""you call its\"""" a special for everyone for the hour before music started or just for our group? either way, fantastic. nothing off limits)... this place belongs on my Dives list.  As an added bonus, it's biking distance from my house, if I had a bike at my house.  I'll be back, Joe!",1
"Love Joe's Grotto! Great live music and fun bar scene. Fun little patio area outside. Darts, pool, great drink specials and awesome music. Not too crowded but crowded enough. Joe is there most nights and great fun! Will be back next time in AZ!",1
"Checked out Joe's for some live music.  I have been here quite a few times, but not recently.\n\nWhat a change!  Much more room around the stage since the games got moved to the new space.  Stage seems bigger, but maybe it's just me.\n\nWith the loss of Blooze, I am sure I'll be back here more often.\n\nBest place in the area for live music and reasonably priced drinks.",1
"Not a fan for a music venue, Good music but really who wants to sit at a tiny table to watch a rock band. No drinks on the stage floor area allowed the fun police run around to keep you from standing too close to the isle or too close to the stage area with a drink. Not a huge fan of the area either.",0
"Went to Joe's last night.  Not my first time at all, but my first time seeing the expansion and it looks AMAZING!!!!  I love it!  The place looks amazing, the employees are always so nice and are so helpful and friendly, and the bands (especially Money Shot) are awesome.  \n\nI HIGHLY recommend going to Joes.  It is a great place to make your usual hang out!",1
"I'm glad I finally made it to Joe's Grotto. I've been wanting to come here for a long time. Good place to catch a live band, probably my next favorite place after The Rhythmn Room. The servers are friendly-the girl who took care of me at the small bar near the door to the patio was a sweetheart.  They have a big screen TV outside so you can still watch the band play while have a smoke outside and/or an outdoor drink on the patio. Drink prices are reasonable. The stage area is set up nicely with tables and chairs nicely set up up to watch bands play. I will be coming here again soon for some more live tunes.",1
"I've been to the Grotto a few times since they have good bands and a couple of them are friends of mine. But last was strange. The band was great (I'm probably biased on that since the singer is a friend of mine) but what was the deal with the $4 dollar bottles and drafts? Also, the bartenders working last night kinda sucked - not friendly at all and slow with the service. I'll be back again for more music but if I have the same experience with getting drinks, I'm done.",0
"Joe's Grotto is my home away from home. I first came to this place when my boyfriend's band, Frequis, played here about a year ago, and I've been in love ever since. Mr. Grotto himself is a gentleman and a scholar. He is so damn friendly, always greeting us whenever we stop in. The place is a great venue for watching local acts. The sound system here is pretty good, and even though the club is small, it still feels roomy and home-like. Joe's also houses two pool tables, a few dart boards, and (my personal favorite) two pinball machines. The club is also equipped with an outdoor patio, which is surprisingly spacious for such a tiny area.\nGranted, I may be a bit biased, but for good reason, I promise. You can't do any wrong at Joe's. The drinks keep on flowing, the specials are cheap, and the music never ends. You'd be an idiot not to check this place out.\n\np.s. Don't forget to try the Trix Shot. You're welcome.",1
Visiting home after a long time away. Great to see this place in the neighborhood. Great bartender and owner. I'll be back next time I visit.,1
"Great small venue. Cheap beer, live music, pretty girl's and a nice patio.  Get there early for big shows so you can be on the side of the bar where the stage is. The acoustics are much better. If you are there for the music...",1
LOVE This place! Live music is the best music! Rock out here with local to National bands! LOVE!!!!!!!,1
"Average food, VERY limited delivery area, and abrupt customer service.  Very meh.",0
"Only had the Chef Salad and while it lived up to the name in portion size, it was boring as all get out. I'm gonna have to try to their pizza on of these days. No lunch special besides the slice of cheese pizza, booooooo. \n\nReally, nothing special. 12 bucks for a salad and an iced tea. Should have went to Picazzo's.",0
"So I thought I would order from my local neighborhood pizza joint for a quick Saturday afternoon lunch. Big mistake! The cheese tasted like rubber, pepperoni was small and crusty, the crust itself tasted like cardboard. I picked it up and the atmosphere seems pretty cool inside, just don't expect good pizza, this was by far the worst I've ever had. We got a large and threw the leftovers out, you know it's bad when that happens.",0
Not the place you keep going back again and again.  Pizza sauce too sweet.,0
"What a rip off this place is. I First i'd like to say food is slightly above average, way over priced. I had coupon for a pizza and 20 wings all I asked was for them to do half honey bbq and half hot and they wouldn't budge. I ended up buy 1 medium 1 large and 2 dozen wings it cost 50 dollars. I will settle for Dominos or even red devil, never again.",0
"The food was awesome. The place is cozy with comical flair for words on the menus. The cowboy music was a little depressing for the lunch time crowd. The server did mess up our order, but she was honest and fixed it before we noticed.",1
"My boyfriend and I go to Fatso's all the time! At first we were hesitant because of the name, but they won us over! It's my favorite local pizza and the servers are like family. We enjoy the live music too. We're fans of the Hawaiian pizza and the Carnivore pizza. Worth checking out...",1
"To say the pizza & wings here is amazing would be an understatement! This place is great. It's small, not fancy, but it's a great atmosphere. They have live music on the weekends, and it can get loud.\n\nThe only downside is that the wait staff is a little slow. Since they are so busy, i'm not sure if it's due to lack of staff or just . . well, being busy. The wait staff is wonderful however. Always happy and willing to help you.\n\nAnother sad thing is, even though Fatso's delivers, they miss my street (Union Hills) by ONE LIGHT!!! So I will forever have to pick up my delicous food, which is also ok to see their happy faces!",1
"I gave it a shot based on the Yelp ratings, but this was just awful pizza.  It was on par with Little Caesars and Eats-a-Pizza.  The crust was hard and overcooked.  The toppings slid right off since it was cooked to death and arrived with the center BOILING hot.  If your a big fan of cheap frozen pizza, I think you'll love Fatso's Pizza because it's totally reminiscent of Red Baron pizzas you'd find for $5 at Walmart.  I'm not going to go deep into what was wrong simply because everything was bad about the darn thing.  I ended up just leaving 75% of it there and paying my bill.  It's not the waitress fault and I tipped her, but only the old standard of 15% because she was no help making our meal any better.  Wouldn't you think she'd offer to take it back, remake it, or offer something better on the menu?  Nope, she just looked at us like this was the first time she'd ever heard their pizza was dog food on a hockey puck and went about her way.  \""""Sorry you don't like it\"""" is all we got from her although she seemed to be a nice lady.  The wings were baked and that's okay as long as I know that going in, and the menu told us so very clearly (I liked that).  Although I definitely prefer fried, these were okay.  They were nothing special since they just seemed to be un-doctored hot sauce and butter.  My issue with them was that they were tiny, teeny, itsy-bitsy, little baby wings.  Seriously, if you're going to charge that much for wings, offer up wings that are at least thicker than the celery sticks.  An average person could eat 2-3 dozen without spoiling dinner.  All in all, I'd have to say this is a great place if you want a local drunks hangout and high school cafeteria food in one convenient location.  I'll not be back.",0
Worst pizza I have had in a long time.  Ordered the so called deep dish.  If you like thick doughy crust with absolutely no toppings you may be thrilled.  It was terrible.   All you get is undercooked crust.  What a waste of $21 bucks.,0
"Went today with my toddler, had the lunch special (a 9inch cheese pizza) to share, it was ok, a bit reminiscent of a Totinos frozen pizza though. \n\nService was ok, though when my son threw up after a few bites of the pizza (and right as the server walked by) the server did not even offer more napkins. So that was disappointing. \n\nPrevious delivery experiences have been better. Which is the only reason they get 2 stars.",0
"Not much beats this place in North Phoenix. Plenty of good beer, good pub food and good company. Great place on a Friday night for live music.",1
"Just had another Fatso's pizza .. however, this time we tried the pan pizza style dough .. LOVED the pizza part, but not so much of the crust (the part where there is no ingredient, and its like a bread stick part) ... it was tasteless ... but the overall pizza was fantastic :)",1
"Have been a regular here for years. Just ordered 48 dollars of food to go. We asked for 2 extra ranch dressing.  The bartender re ran our card for the extra dollar.  Seems awfully cheap.  The pizza and wings are already overpriced.spoke to the owner about the charge and he couldnt care less.  We come here 2 or 3 times a month and spent 50 bucks a pop. Never again . I dont understand why an owner would tell a customer tough shit, I dont care what you think. You dont like it go somewhere else.",0
This was a great local hangout. Delicious thin crust pizza (we had the Big Johnson) and inexpensive beer. Tonight they had a fantastic guitar duo. Really fun to hang out and see the locals and watch a game or two.,1
"When my wife and I were there, we both agreed on how to gauge this place. \n\nThis is where you bring your kids to have sit down pizza. It is a step up from Peter Piper...okay thats not nice of me to say, it is a big step up from PP, BUT it is no Spinatos by any means. \n\nThis has a great local bar feel over on the bar side, but it is far enough where you could bring your children and not worry about the belligerent drunk giving your kids new vocabulary words to try out at school. \n\nThe pizza like i was saying is the type to serve to your kids...It is a little bit more pricey than i would prefer, but definitely isn't super greasy like other places.\n\n\ni might bump them up to 3 stars if I ever visit the bar and it's fun, but i can't see more than a three.",0
"19 beers in tap, specialty bombers and great pizza.  Also, they have live music and sports.",1
"First time coming to Fatso's pizza and we receive and unwelcoming vibe from the waitress. She had no costumer service and she made it seem like she definitely did not want to be at her job. Very empty and lonely place. The pizza was cold once it was handed to us. She did not come back to ask if we were doing okay, and there was no more then 10 people at the restaurant. She was very impatient when we were asking for our food. Definitely not coming back to that place. Very disappointed in the costumer service and upset with the poor quality they had.",0
"We always come here! I love the giant salad. Their ranch dressing is delicious. Their wings are really good as well! They have sports on TV's everywhere, a usual beer drinking, age 40-50 crowd at the bar, and live music on the weekends...classic rock type music from what I've noticed. It's a good laid back family place.",1
"Good Lord does Fatso's have the BEST pizza around. No seriously, it's the bees knees! I just moved back from California and you best believe this was my 1st pizza stop!!! YUM!",1
Awesome place to relax and have a beer and some food.  Lots of screens to watch sports and lots of beer choices to choose from on tap.  The guys that run this place are great they always say hello and are always friendly and cheerful.  I have never had a single problem here at all.  I go here often and will continue.,1
"This practice is great at everything: till they get your money, then GOOD LUCK! Refused to reline my denture unless I paid almost $800.00 and it was WITHIN THE SIX MONTH time period as stated in treatment plan. Letter and phone call got me nowhere. Proceed with caution and hold back a little $ if you can or you may NOT get what you need or paid for!!!!......still walking around with NO top teeth two years later!!! Thanks  for nothing!",0
"Team Dameron is great! Great staff and they keep things simple, which I enjoy.",1
"I have been a patient of Dr Dameron for over 10 years and never have I been treated rudely until today. I am appalled over the way Sabrina, the Doctors assistant, spoke to me on the phone. I will be seeking a new dentist.",0
"This place is just ordinary, there is nothing really great about it except that they deliver.  the best item I had on their menu was the shrimp in lobster sauce, the sweet and sour and orange chicken tasted like it was previously frozen and similar to something you can buy at costco in the freezer isles. They are a bit overpriced, but I think most of the asian food in Arizona is overpriced and lacking in authenticity.",0
"Good thing they deliver because this is the only reason we have ordered from them. We had pork eggrolls that lacked flavor and was kind of mushy on texture. Chicken lomein was not at all good. The lemon chicken had a chemically taste. The fried rice wasn't horrible, but not that great.",0
"Wow... This place is sooo bad.   Lo mein looked good but the box probably had more flavor.  Apparantly 10 packs of duck sauce is all the seasoning this food gets.   Overpriced, very, very bland.  We love Chinese food (especially delivered) but I'm finishing this review on the toilet :(",0
"This was my first time in this place..my aunt and I were skeptical at first as the parking lot was empty.  We walk in and no one is there except the owner.  We order moo goo gai pan, chicken with green beans and wor ton soup.  We really enjoyed the moo goo pan...very tasty.  Not too many drink specials and the ice tea was not too our standard we thought it was regular ice tea but he brought us green tea in a bottle.  I would try it for delivery as it's near my house.",1
"I ordered them last night for the first time and it was pretty bad.  I actually thought they were the Chinese place on Tatum and Bell, turns out I was wrong.  \n\nI ordered Chicken Fried Rice and it was seriously an embarrassment to the Chinese culture.  Probably all Americanized Chinese food is an embarrassment, but you get my point.  \n\nMy rule of thumb is that if you are going to eat at an \""""ethnic\"""" food place, the people working/cooking there should be of whatever decent the food that is being served is, that wasn't the case here.  \n\nMajor thumbs down.",0
"Holy PooPoo Platter Batman!  This place really sucks!  After waiting 2.5 hours for my food (and several calls to the establishment asking where it is) it finally arrived.\n\nIt was crushed, leaking out of the containers and was so mixed up I wasn't even sure if it was what I really ordered.  Half of the order was already cold.\n\nTrying to make the best of the situation I sampled something that looked like the closest thing to what I ordered.  YECH!  It was either F.U.B.A.R. when it left the kitchen or became contaminated by something else in the bag en route.  That food was Naz-TEE!\n\nMy family is now starving and we have been told by the restaurant that in order to receive credit for the food, the driver has to come back out and pick it up. Peachy by me...  My trashcan is too good for this crap.  We looked at the food and would rather go hungry anyway.  I just hope they don't \""""re-gift\"""" that little gem into someone else's order.  Hell, for all I know that's what they did to us.\n\nPoor food quality.\nPoor service.\nPoor delivery.\nAnd a little pricey for all of that.\n\nYunan needs to take a long walk off a short pier. NEVER GOING BACK!",0
"Last night my wife asked me if I wanted anything when she was going out shopping, I said, \""""sure get me some egg foo young/\"""" We'll she brought me home some of the worst egg foo young I have ever eaten anywhere from Yunan Wok. She has been begging me to stop there for weeks since she got a flyer in our house door. I checked it out on Yelp and it confirmed much of what I had already thought, too expensive and even worse the food reports were awful. \n\nWe'll now I can concur. My egg foo young had to be premade frozen patties. They do not put the meat in the omelet mix, rather serve it with the sauce. I can say there was an ample portion of barbecue pork in my order but it could not make up for the awful patties. The texture was grainy. No sign of fresh bamboo shoots, bean sprouts or anything else that provided texture. My wife's chicken and broccoli was nothing to write home about either. We are used to getting a container of the main course with a separate container for rice. This was served in a typical to go lunch container, which in itself wouldn't be that bad, but the portion was small, and I mean small. \nMy wife will not shop there again for sure.",0
"BUUUUUMMMMERR!!!! We ordered \""""dinner\"""" from here tonight and were seriously disappointed.  Let's start with the egg rolls- I could have bought something similar at the grocery store and heated it up in my oven; I'm not even sure the \""""crab angels\"""" had anything more than cream cheese inside of it.  Furthermore, I had ordered Shrimp with Lobster Sauce was pretty clearly the shrimp with vegetables.  And they don't have beef chop suey on the menu.  Seriously?  Really?  REALLY!!! I would have called to complain but after reading the other person's review realized it simply wasn't worth my time . . . We'll never order from here again.",0
"1 star is too many. We were hoping to have some good Asian food delivered and this was not the place. The delivery time was good, they got here in about 30 minutes, but it went down hill from there. We ordered for a family of 5 and it was about $70 (including tip). Everything we had was border line uneatable. The white rice was fine, but seriously, you can't screw up white rice.\n\nThe chicken was horrible, the mushu Pork (one of the favorite meals) was horrid and only came with 4 pancakes. Even the hot & sour soup was just huge chunks of tofu in some horrible broth. After the chicken and pork being so bad, figured I'd try the Mongolian beef. It was not good.",0
Tried it for the first time and the last time....over priced icky mushy food with extremely small portions. I called to inform them and got a very slight sorry,0
"Ordered sweet and sour chicken and pork fried rice.  Neither was good, we threw it out.  My husband did like the egg drop soup.",0
"This isn't a review of their food - but rather of their means of advertising.  STOP DROPPING YOUR CHOPSTICKS IN MY FRONT YARD!  If you want my business, get better reviews (i.e. better food/service).  I had to dislodge your chopsticks from my tire yesterday!!  Annoying.....",0
Been ordering from these dudes for a long time and usually wait until my wife is on out of town and I'm not in the mood to cook. Ha!\n\nThe inside of this restaurant is a little scary and pretty dark. I've never really seen anyone eating in here. They do have a little fish tank with some big fish swimming around in circles and looking for attention. I get hungry just watching them.\n\nMost of their menu is your typical American style Chinese and nothing that would be considered authentic or what they really eat overseas. It is hard to find the real stuff and when you do they end up closing.\n\nAlways order the Volcano Beef and have them make it extra spicy. The House Lo Mein is also very good and my wife seems to enjoy that one the best. Usually upgrade to some Fried Rice to take things up to the next level.\n\nThis place is probably best for a night of heavy drinking and getting it delivered to the house. The food is ok but the prices are higher than other places with a similar menu. The delivery times can also vary depending the crew that is working that night.\n\nMore or less this place is a Meh experience with slight touches of A-OK. The best part is you will have some tasty leftovers the next day to work off any type of party residuals. BEER ME!\n\n2.5 STARS,0
Very helpful and knowledgable staff. The prices are actually lower than you can find on the web. I wanted to buy a new controller for the irrigation being fed up with my old one. The staff actually listened to my problem and offered to check out the old one to see if it could be fixed. They checked it out an offered a cheaper solution which did not require replacing the whole thing. You can't get this service at home depot.,1
The owner does not care about the employees.  Reducing hours to PT to alleviate paying health insurance and vacation time.  Great staff area leaving.  The pricing and markup is also incredible!\n\nGo somewhere else that supports employees.,0
"I would give Saguaro Family Practice 5 stars if it were based purely on my primary physician. \n\nDr. Gujrathi has been my doctor for about 8 years and she is absolutely amazing. She is patient, open minded, talented, intuitive, and caring. I used to hate doctors until I started seeing her. She has seen me through the ups and downs of the last 8 years of my medical history. I actually look forward to visits with her (even when I'm feeling like total crap!) just because she is SUCH a pleasure to be around.\n\nI am only knocking off one star because of other staff members. I have had to see other doctors at the practice when she was booked and I did not like their bedside manner and one time I was even misdiagnosed. \n\nMost of the time the office staff is great, but I have had a few experiences where they were rude or impatient. In particular, I went to an after hours appointment recently and thought the only young woman working behind the front counter crossed the line from rude to a little nasty.\n\nMinor annoyances aside, SFP, in particular Dr. G, is fantastic!",1
"NOTE: The \""""Poor\"""" review/rating is only for John C. Lincoln Health Network - Saguaro Family Practice facility and staff and NOT for Dr. Mora whom our entire family loves. \n\nDr. Mora is our family doctor. Dr. Mora is incredibly knowledgeable, and getting an appointment to see him is very easy. When you meet Dr. Mora, he always greets you with a hand-shake and takes the time to sit down and actually talk to you about your healthcare needs. It is important to note that Dr. Mora has moved his practice location recently. \n\nDr. Mora used to be with John C. Lincoln Health Network - Saguaro Family Practice group located at 18404 North Tatum Boulevard , Phoenix, AZ 85032, (602) 992-1900. This John C. Lincoln group was atrocious! With the exception of Dr. Mora and his Medical Assistant Erica, the rest of the staff there were terribly rude. Not to mention the office was always filthy which did not make me feel very comfortable going there. (Also you should know that if you call the John C. Lincoln office where Dr. Mora used to work, they will NOT tell you that Dr. Mora has moved. Instead they will try and make you see one of their other doctors there, and I would not recommend any other doctor there to see.) So, I couldn't be happier that Dr. Mora has moved! \n\nDr. Mora now works for Scottsdale Healthcare Primary Care Paradise Valley, 5010 E. Shea Blvd., Suite D100, Scottsdale, AZ 85254, (480) 882-7420. This new location is the kind of doctor office you feel comfortable going to. It is very clean and the staff are very courteous and extremely helpful. If you are new to the valley or looking to change doctors, please consider going to see Dr. Mora at his new practice location. You will not find a better doctor in the valley than Dr. Mora!",0
"I have been a patient here for my over 6 years, however the many of the old doctors have retired, and their spots have been filled with qualified but uncaring doctors.\n\nI made an appointment with the hospital several weeks prior to look at my arm which I believed to be fractured or splintered at the bone.  Two days before my appointment a itchy bacterial rash spread across my back.  On appointment day I was told that I would have to choose between getting a prescription for the infection spreading across my back or them looking at my arm.  Of course the rash took precedence at the time, so 5 minutes and one small little piece of paper after my appointment started I was shuffled out the door--arm still in extreme pain, unacknowledged and ignored by the doctor.\n\nWord of advice: If scheduling an appointment here, do NOT schedule with Dr. Luis M Irizarry.  He doesn't care about anything but herding cattle in and out the door so he can make as much money as possible in a given day.",0
Dr Rebbelke is the worst doctor ever. Very rude and suggests hippy alternatives. No one goes to doctors for hippy alternatives. Front staff also pushed multiple people in front of me extending my wait to an hour past my appointment time. Why bother having appointments if your walk ins get priority.,0
I have a new born and see Dr Berkowitz. The staff has been great with placing me in an exam room right away so I do not have to wait in the lobby. So far I am very happy here,1
"Just moved to Phoenix, needed a physical for my insurance company for the new year - only required blood pressure, height, weight and cholesterol.  Dr. Walter Kmiecik not only required me to schedule a follow up visit in order to get the form completed (two office visits for one form) but he ordered every single blood test imaginable which cost me $400 in lab work not required by my insurance company.  Then, to top it off, in the follow up appointment he proceeded to act genuinely disappointed when he found that my health was excellent and he couldnt bilk me for more \""""medical care\"""" I didn't need.   This is a crooked, dishonest practice and I would not recommend anyone patronizing them, particularly Dr. Walter Kmiecik.",0
"Want to feel like you're in a small town?  Come here.  Why?  Because there is such an amazing sence of community here.  Sit up at the counter, try a slice of one of Peggy's famous homade pies and chat with the waitress.  She's better than any bartender.  Or better yet, bring some family or friends and sit down at one of the tables and order some real food.  Real food because it's all homemade.  From the biscuits to the chicken fried steak to the smothered chicken to the meatloaf or some real get you going breakfast food.  From scratch food at practically fast food prices.  It's insane. \n\nThe waitresses are amazing.  Our 3rd time there we had the same waitress we had the 1st time.  She remembered our order - including a special request for gravy on the side.  Before we said it.  And it had been weeks since she saw us.  We decided it was kinda freaky - but amazingly cool at the same time. They are all amazingly nice in a down home kind of way.  Ya might get called hun.  Or sweetie.  I've seen regulars get their hair scruffled.  \n\nOne time we were there I saw the wait staff pull out the white pages to try to find the phone number for one of their regulars.  They were concerned that they hadn't seen him yet that week.  They found out he was sick, and one of the women said she'd bring him some food on her way home.  Right there and then - they had my business.  I may not live in the area anymore, but we try to make it over there at least a few times a year.  Who wouldn't want to support service like that?\n\nWhen you go - be aware of their hours.  These are small town too.  \nM-F 5am-9pm\nSaturday - 5am-3pm\nSunday 6am-3pm",1
This year marks the 15th Year 40th St has been open. This year marks the 1st time I have been there......That is a sad thing. This place is exactly what I want. \n\n1. Homemade food. I am not talking about just the soup either. \n\n2. Small and friendly \n\n3. Good prices and portions to match \n\nI had the meatloaf open faced sandwich served with mashed potato's and corn. It was the best I have had in years. Maybe the best ever. They wrap the ML in bacon while cooking it. It gives a good flavor to the meat and they even slice some of the bacon in with the meal. \n\nPS the biscuits look amazing.,1
"Why, why, WHY has no one told me about this place! This place is EXACTLY what I want when I go out to breakfast!\n\nThe location:\nTotally tucked into that strip mall at 4oth & Greenway where most people (including me) never get past Starbucks and The Gelato Spot. Small inside, but feels cozy. \n\nThe service:\nAwesome- nice ladies who fill up your coffee, are sweet to your kid and know that what they do is based on immediately making you feel comfortable. On a related note for those of you with kids- There is NOTHING I appreciate more at a restaurant than a server who 1) gets your kids food out as soon as possible. Eating kid = happy kid and 2) hands YOU the hot plate so you can take care of it, rather than dropping the plate in front of your 2 year old, announcing it's hot and leaving. DUH!\n\nThe food:\nFantastic- I had the chicken and veggie skillet. I never order skillets because they are always greasy and loaded with cheese. I took a risk and it paid off! Perfect combo of yummy but  not, I need to purge after this!\n\nThe price:\nJust right, a LOT of food for not  a lot of money. Me, the wife, and our full size 2 year old ate for under $25. And let's just say I took food home- NEVER happens :)\n\nThe customers:\nTotally cool- the place is full of regulars who were all nice to our little one. It didn't hurt that he went table to table saying goodbye on our way out, but nothing makes me want to smash a face as much as a person who is rude to my kid so mad props to the regs!\n\nAll in all, this place  is just my speed and we will be back... A LOT!",1
This place is great.  I have only had breakfast but the food is sooo good. It's a really small place so there us usually a wait but it'sworth it. Enjoy. : ),1
"As has been said before, this is a tiny place full of regular customers.  The portions are generous and the price certainly is right.  The waitress wouldn't stop asking my 2 year old what the \""""Easter Bunny\"""" was bringing her.  It got kind of old especially since we don't worship Bunnies at our house.  Seating was tight and we got to sit next to a guy having breakfast with his girlfriend and happy to say that his wife was home sleeping.  I wouldn't say that that the clientele all lived in the trailer park but some do.  If we go again we'll try and get there early before the crowds.  The bacon was especially tasty.",1
"This is definitely not my favorite place for breakfast.  I hated the wicked crammed layout of this place and the decor is just confusing.  I don't get the diamond-plate on the walls and I definitely don't understand the down home country kitschy decorations up on shelves.  Whatever, it's about the food right?\n\nI ordered a bacon and cheese omelet with hashbrowns and I was a little less than impressed.  The omelet was pretty crispy on the edges, and that is only appropriate when I order fried eggs.  The bacon was okay, but too overdone.  There wasn't enough cheese and the cheese that was there was just blah.  The hashbrowns just tasted like potatoes.  They needed a ton of salt for me to eat them.  I thought the portions, while enough for me, were a bit small for the price.  Pretty much everywhere else I can get a heaping plate of breakfast food for under 7 bucks.  \n\nI've had better.  That's really all there is.  The service was nice enough but I just don't really care for this place.  I really felt like I was eating in some po-dunk town with all the strange \""""characters\"""" dining here.  At least it didn't make me sick.",0
"It's not often I feel the need to rush home to post a review for a place I have just eaten.  But I am in a breakfast bliss thanks to this place.  \n\nMoving to a different part of town is difficult, especially when it comes to things like finding all new places to eat a inexpensive yet great breakfast on the weekends. Alas, the Peoria Cafe is too far away for a Saturday morning breakfast run, so a new \""""hole in the wall\"""" was needed. I refuse the \""""popular\"""" standards such as IHOP and Denny's, and I was worried that there might not be a suitable spot nearby.\n\nThank God for Yelp! The reviews were mostly good for this place, which was only a few miles away, so thought I would try it.  Everyone said to expect a line, but I got lucky and grabbed a spot at the counter right away. Ordered something simple; eggs and bacon with hash browns and toast. OMG, the bacon, the bacon.  It was incredible, the thickest, most wonderful bacon I have eaten in a while.  Hash browns were crispy (not greasy) and eggs, well are eggs.  I can't wait to bring all my family here when they visit! \n\nONe thing though, when people say it is small, they are not kidding.  Even after reading that, I was surprised how small it was.  There are about 15 tables packed in there, and that's it. One of the waitresses was talking about 2 guys sitting at a table talking for over 3 hours - don't be rude, go somewhere else and catch up.  Make room for someone else to sit down and let your waitress earn a living.",1
"I just never understand how people can think this cafe is so great.  My folks regularly eat here, but every single time I have gone, I have been very disappointed with the quality of their food.  I was there yesterday (with my folks) and ordered 1/2 grilled cheese and a bowl of French Onion soup.  My sandwich was cold, cheese not melted, and my soup had unmelted square cheese sticking out the bottom.  It was barely hot.  My Mom had the fish and chips and she said it was the worst fish ever.  When we left the place, it was packed.  I guess I simply look for good food, prepared to order, and served hot.  Not my favorite place, and I think it was my last visit.",0
I was pissed off to be full... \n\nThat's how good this place was.,1
"there are great reviews for this place, but for me, the experience was only so-so. the food really wasn't anything impressive. the eggs themselves were fine, but salsa was too watery and made them runny. the toast tasted like white bread but they said it was sourdough. the hash browns were the best part of the meal. it was very cramped and there was no clear path to the door. you sit basically on top of other guests - no real space between tables, which is awkward unless you're the type of person that  wants to get to know the strangers seated 2 feet from your table. our server wasn't so friendly either. i don't think i'll be back.",0
"Don't get me wrong - I enjoy a hole-in-the-wall sorta place. But I also expect the food to outshine the location, ya know?\n\nFirst, let me say there was nothing -wrong- with the food.  The omelet was not under or overcooked - but it was just bland.  Personally, I like my omelets to have a little browning and caramelization and these were just typical and plain.  The coffee wasn't very good - it tasted a little burnt, in fact, and I left not very culinarily satisfied.\n\nI can appreciate the unique look and feel (cramped as it is), and can tell there are a bunch of regulars whom the staff know by name, and there is a good \""""vibe\"""" to the place.  But without the food to back it up, I doubt I'll be coming back.",0
"Nothing says family like 40th St. Cafe. My family and I have been going to 40th St Cafe since I was a kid and it has a special place in my heart.  My mom was at 40th St Cafe every day for coffee, many days for lunch, and we often went for dinner. Being a single mom, raising two boys, she also was allowed to pick up shifts to earn extra money. When she was hospitalized for pneumonia, the cafe fed my brother and I. One of her dreams was to take us back to New York and show us where she grew up, but we could never afford it. . After she was diagnosed with cancer, the cafe staff, and some of the regulars raised enough money to send my mom, brother, and I to New York for a week with spending money. Our whole family was also there for a big reunion. It is a trip we will never forget. 5 years ago, we lost my mom to breast cancer. Every year, the cafe participates in the Walk for the Cure in honor of my mom and others that have passed. \n  I live in Gilbert now, so I do not go as often as I would like, but any opportunity to get to that side of town, 40th St Cafe is where I will go. Peggy's Pies are incredible! Best in the valley. If you like good home cooked meals, this is the place to go. I usually end up ordering the Cobb Salad with Blue Cheese dressing. They make their own Blue Cheese, and it is amazing, different than what you are used to. I also love their Guacamole Burger. For breakfast, you cannot go wrong with the Ultimate Skillet. \n  So if you are anything like me and like to bring business to people who really go the extra mile to make a difference in people's lives, then go check it out. You won't be sorry you did. :)",1
"I have only had breakfast here a few times, but thought it was great. They have large portioned, country style breakfasts. Very good value since some of the other nearby breakfast places charge much more for smaller portions. Everything tastes fresh (no frozen potatoes!) and the service is friendly. I just wish it was a little bigger inside the restaurant, since its a bit cramped.",1
I really enjoy this place. It is always busy and the food and service are great. It's the small town resturant in the big city.,1
I Love this little Cafe. I have been going to 40th Street since they opened. I'm pretty sure my Dad's a regular. Everything I get is just how I expect it. My usual is ham and eggs which is a pretty good size breakfast to include hashbrowns and a bread. Coffee is wonderful!!\n\nI have even tried their lunches. They made a pretty good burger and buffalo chicken sandwich is great. They have great daily specials as well. Friendly ladies too. Thanks Ladies =),1
"Wow this was place is so creepy and the customers are just as creepy,A friend of mine hade mentioned that this place had good breakfast,so I thought I would give it a try.I walked in the joint to give it a try and the looks i got when i walked in where enough to make me want to run out I have never seen more racist freaks crammed into a small place in my life,The Career sever was just as racist as all of the freaks in the joint, just rude as hell,Bottom line if you you want to experience phoenix racism at it's best go to 40th st Cafe,food cold service terrible and rude career waitress from hell, i would warn anyone who is not white and ignorant to not set foot in this place,more freakks and employees crammed into this place than i have ever seen!Stay clear unless your writeing a book on racism in phoenix at its best.",0
"My family and I have been faithful, frequent patrons of this place for 6 1/2 years.  We appreciated the service, food, and prices.  However, things have changed for the worse!  On our last few visits, the portion sizes have been consistently shrinking.  I suspect sub-standard ingredients in use, as well.  Such a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!  After all this time, I can no longer count on my expectations being fulfilled.  I feel so CHEATED!  I would much rather see a fair price increase than have to search for a new favorite spot.",0
"Eggs Benedict were good not great. But the staff was very friendly and attentive. Good american breakfast place. Close quarters for seating, reminds me of being on a ship. That's a good thing, because the quality of service also is cruise like. I will be back.",1
"Great little hidden local spot.  I arrived before my breakfast date and the server got my ready with coffee and the menu.  My coffee cup was never empty.  This is a huge plus in my breakfast world.  I ordered with breakfast sandwich with bacon substituted for the ham and hash browns extra crispy.  This was such a simple comfort food breakfast that I could have easily cooked for myself at home, but instead the staff here made it for me and it was even better.\nThis is truly a tiny little place with as many tables as possible pushed in there.  So if you don't like seeing what your neighbor is eating, you might try someplace else.  I personally loved making conversation about what they ordered for breakfast.\nLove 40th Street Cafe and can't wait to try it for lunch.",1
Blueberry pancakes were very bland.  No flavor at all.  Excellent service however.,0
"Great place. The food was good. The prices were reasonable, and the service was great. It's a great neighborhood joint.",1
"Breakfast sandwich. Taylor ham. Sourdough, home fries.  That's what you need to get!! Great service!  Awesome menu!",1
"Meh, disappointing. The food and service were nothing to write home about. I got the Eggs Benedict. The hollandaise was tasteless and coffee tasted like dirt.  My plate was taken away by Tina without being asked if I was done.  The same server didn't even thank me when she gave me my bill.  I would have had better food and service at Denny's.",0
Great selection of food and good prices. Had never noticed it tucked away in the plaza till a friend of mine mentioned it to me. I was not expecting much from the outside but I am glad I went in.,1
"Great service & great food! Brought a group of 13, 5 being small children. Everyone was so kind!!!",1
"This place needs to be called the Cheers of Phoenix. Everybody knew everybody's name as they came in and left. The food was good but the friendliness of the staff and the fact that so many people were regulars made me think this is a place I need to go back to over and over as well. I had my usual, an omelet and fries for brunch on Sunday, which was exactly how I ordered it and tasted awesome. Pam, my server recommended chicken strips which are hand made from fresh chicken and did look delicious on another customers plate. Decor needs a little tidying up. I love the fact that they're honoring our service men and women but it is a little hodgepodge. Worth a visit if you like good food and places that like their regulars enough to know their names!",1
"I have been eating breakfast here for the last 25 years. My dad and I would go every Sunday together. BEST HOME TOWN, ORIGINAL, FEEL GOOD DINER LEFT IN PHOENIX! Peggy is the owner as always has been. Her staff never changes and you always have pleasant people to visit with. I just took my own children in for breakfast just the other day even though we live 25 miles away! The food is great and VERY inexpensive....Kids meals are $1.50-$2.00....WOW!\n\nSherrie and Tina are the best!!!!\n\nThanks!\nRichard (Blake)",1
"Breakfast special:2 egg omelet, home fries, and English muffin was excellent! Service is great, and pecan pie slice purchased to go didn't make it out the door! :)",1
"RJ's surprised me when we walked in! I was expecting it to be far more of a dive! It's actually quite nice with tables, a bar, and a back area with games and sometimes live music. It's pretty loud at times, and nothing really fancy about the big open room. They only had wine one of four times we were here, but I guess that's to be expected. I figure they could at least keep some of those tiny screw cap bottles for when people request. I settle for beer, which is averagely priced. The service is friendly enough and pretty fast considering the bartender always seems to be the server for the entire place. The food here is surprisingly really good! I get grilled cheese, which honestly is one of the best in the Valley. All of the food looks good. It's cheap in price and comes in a basket. \nRJ's is a fine little stop in. I upped the rating due to the food. No patio here... Just a back door with 2 broken plastic chairs and a dumpster.",1
"I have been coming here for 11 years, and they are absolutely wonderful people!  Dottie and Amy are always so helpful and remember their repeat customers.  I have two horses and they have helped me over the years with problems here and there, and Radar always makes me laugh.  I feel at home when I go there.  I would recommend them to anyone!",1
"If you want to be treated poorly, quoted inaccurately for parts and be hung up on...talk to Bob the manager.  Do yourself a favor and find another parts dealer.",0
"This is more of a general review for all Massage Envies. I've been a customer in three different states for a couple years now, and if you've been to one, you've been to them all, really. Massage Envy is a study in why franchises work (when they do work (and massage envy works)).\nMcDonald's became popular because it took the chaos of the burger joint and made it totally orderly and predictable and reliable and clean (ish). Every McDonald's is exactly the same. Massage Envy is a franchise after the McDonald's model, but there is one big difference: you don't need a license to be a fry cook. Thank god, you do to be a masseuse.\nEvery Massage Envy I've ever been to has had more or less the same design, same color palette, same good, courteous service and same expectations. The only appreciable difference between them is the people who work there, and therein lies the possibility of trouble. Not all LMTs are created equal. Some of these people may just be waiting to build their bona fides to go work at a huge fancy spa. And some of them never will.\nThis means that the quality of your massage at Massage Envy is directly connected to who you work with.  And it can take some time to figure out whose style is best for you, naturally.\nIn my opinion though, setting aside evaluating individual therapists, the Massage Envy experience overall is a good one.  They make you feel reasonably special and their membership is a good deal, especially if you live in a place where massages can be ridiculously expensive (Arizona, DC).  They often have cheap spa add-ons that you can purchase, like using special oils or face masks and so on.  \nWhat Massage Envy has done is the same thing McDonald's did - taken something a little dicey and maybe even scary for some folks and made it into a consistent, uniform experience.  While massage enthusiasts will no doubt decry Massage Envy like hamburger enthusiasts do for Mickey D's (and I don't blame them) Massage Envy is a great place for someone who has never had a massage before and wants to try it, or isn't interested in dishing out the dough for a luxury experience at a huge spa.  It's the working man's massage parlor.  Sort of.",1
"The staff is friendly and the massage was decent, but this place is worse than a car dealership.  Before and after your massage your are bombarded with sales pitches.  Memberships, lotions, upgrades, etc.\n\nAlso, lets say you buy their stupid membership and don't use your monthly massage.  So, suppose you want to give that massage to somebody else.  That will cost you a transfer fee.\n\nWhoever came up with the Massage Envy idea is brilliant and probably a billionaire right now.  However, it won't be long until a better place comes along that offers quality massages at a cheaper price without the high-pressure sales environment.",0
"I give the 2 stars because my therapist is the one that deserves the stars. I was very disappointed in the way my appointment was handled. I requested the apt online first and in that request I mentioned I had just ran a half marathon. They called to make the apt, but had to leave me a message. I called them back explained I had ran a marathon again and scheduled the apt. Turns out, when I checked in, they told me why didn't I schedule a hour and half apointment instead of just the hour. I didn't know why they asked this, but it turns out, the extra half is comped for those that ran the pf chang marathon.  They missed telling me this information 2 x's prior. They asked if I wanted to re-schedule my appointment so I could take advantage of that promo......NO I am sore today!!!!",0
"Worst customer service I've ever had. I would never go here again,  they are rude and treated me terribly.",0
"Book with Daniel!\n\nFirst, let me clarify that I have never had a bad massage here with anyone; they have always been good. Daniel is just extremely good at what he does! I hear more and more people request him and he's the reason I keep my membership. You won't be disappointed!",1
"Hands down the best vet I've ever seen. (I go to Dr. Kastner, not the other doc here, who seems very nice, too, but I've never worked with him.) He is patient and will thoroughly explain everything to you, including risks and benefits. Two of my dogs needed surgery, and he was very honest in referring me to a specialist for one of the surgeries, which he said he could do for less $$ than the specialist, but he thought the specialist would be better for it. He always remembers us when we come in, and unlike many vets we've seen, I never feel like he's just trying to \""""sell\"""" us on anything. He doesn't push procedures that aren't really necessary, and he never makes you feel like a bad pet parent for considering not doing a procedure. His honest is unwavering - he'll tell you what's really necessary and why. If you're worried about your pet, this is where you'll get an honest ad unbiased medical opinion. The office staff is also always really nice.",1
"I saw  Dr. Kastner for years who cared for my cat.  We switched to Scottsdale Cat Clinic about three years ago and found many conditions undiagnosed and/or untreated, such as hypertension.  These conditions could adversely affect the longevity of our cat's life, so we didn't take this lightly and took the advice of our new vet.  \n\nNow our cat is elderly, his health is declining and we were looking to take him back to PVAH to diagnose him since it is much closer to our home.  When I called to schedule the appointment, I was absolutely shocked at the response of the woman who answered the phone.  She said, \""""Is this a situation that could turn into euthanasia?\""""  Needless to say, we will never be stepping foot back into this clinic again.  The utter lack of empathy, understanding, gentleness and compassion from people we saw for years came as a total surprise.  \n\nIf you have a senior cat, do yourself a favor and go to Scottsdale Cat Clinic!",0
"Vets are friendly, vet techs make you feel welcome, prices are great (they don't charge an office visit when your pet gets shots and you get a check-up).  Only complaint I have is that when my pet has gotten sick it can be tricky to get in.  But otherwise, they're really fantastic!",1
Dr. Weinacker is unbelievable with my dogs. He is such a fantastic vet and very knowledgeable. My current dogs LOVE him.  I had a dog who had neurological problems and he dealt with her very compassionately and gave amazing referrals and recommendations. I ended up having to put her down as a 4 year old back in 2005 as her condition was deteriorating and the staff couldn't have been kinder about letting me stay in the room with her afterwards for as long as I needed. I was sobbing like a baby of course but the entire staff was so kind and comforting.,1
"Not happy. What a shady place!!\nI call to make an appointment and get a quote as I haves budge to love by. Our dog only needed his yearly shots and a check up. What they quoted and what they actually charged was WAY off!! Then they convince me to have his anal glands extracted and hand me a bottle of allergy spray only to find out I would be charged extra for THAT! I refused the spray much to the nurse's disdain and argued that I was not asked permission or told the additional cost of the anal extraction. They scammed me and on top of that, the doctor talked more about his own dogs than actually talking about mine, his own patient. \nWill not be going here again :(",0
Took excellent care of my baby when I brought her in for a wellness checkup post adoption from MCACC.,1
"So I work at a small animal hospital in the valley, so my expectations of client and patient care is really high.  Chapparral is also an equine hospital which is why I chose them to treat my horse.  The diagnosis of my horse was grim and I had to make the decision to put him down, it was an incredibly difficult time, but the staff was comforting and supportive from beginning to end.  Their compassion and thoughtfulness to the care of my beautiful boy was felt from the first person to touch him, all the way to the last.  They were gentle and kind to him, and when I knew I was going to put him down, they asked if I wanted to have some of his mane and tail to take home with me.  With tear filled eyes I said yes; they brushed his mane and tail out and braided two beautiful pieces from his mane, and braided and cut his tail for me to take home.  After cutting the mane and tail, they tied beautiful ribbon around each piece as a keep sake for me to take home.  There was so much thought in providing me something to comfort me and help remember him by.  During a very difficult time the staff was amazing and I am so grateful for the care we received while we were there.  \nFrom someone who knows the veterinary industry I want to let others know how great this hospital is, and let everyone know I strongly recommend them for care of your beloved pets.  I still have one beautiful horse left, and you can count on me using them in the future for his care as well.",1
I graduated from sca in 99 & now my children attend the school.  I absolutely love the elementary staff.  What a joy to watch my children learning the bible and applying it to real life.  I don't have to worry about what world view the teacher is trying to teach my kids.,1
Unfortunately we are neighbors of this school.  When we moved in we honestly could not have anticipated how completely unconcerned with their community they could be.  There have been so many issues with the loud speakers.  We expected the noise for games and were ok with that.  But there have been cases of high school kids out on the field with no staff supervision plugging in their iPhones and blaring music and just hanging out with friends.  Right now we are going on the 5th hour of blaring music with no game going on.  And the school is on spring break so there is no one to even talk too.  It is completely unacceptable the way they treat the people who live around them.  Oh and on the education bit... the high school cheerleader were selling pom poms to raise money so we thought we would buy a couple.  They were each three dollars.  They tried to give me the wrong change three times before I had to tell them what the change should be!,0

"Stay away from this rip-off joint. Took my car there because my air conditioning wasn't working.

"I have taken my now 15 month old son to both the dance and gym which are free for him. It seems he already like the gym better and so we stuck with that for now, maybe in a few months we try dance again. Ms Caroline is very fun and tries to really interact with the children to get their groove on.\n\nJumping Genie (?) is the gymnastic instructor and makes it fast paced. It took some adjustment for my boy to get used to, but he seemed to like it better last time, so we keep moving. The only thing I wonder if they sanitize all the toys after each session, especially during flu season as they were just left there and not separated out.",1
"I signed my kids up for the Super Camp at AZ Sunrays for one week this summer. The kids have had an absolute blast. The instructors greet them warmly when we arrive each morning. I have been thoroughly impressed by their level of organization. The instructors make sure I sign both kids in and out (even when I forget!) The facility is clean. The kids are engaged from the minute they walk in the door. The camp is a little pricey when paying for two kids but well worth it. As much fun as my children had for the week, I will definitely be looking into classes throughout the year.\n\nAdditionally, the level of customer service I have received has been above and beyond. I had an emergency come up while my children were at camp and when I called to let the office folks know I would be a few minutes late (as it turned out, I couldn't get back to pick them up until the end of the afternoon program) they were so kind and accommodating and made my children feel loved and well taken care of until I could get back to collect them. If my kids had to be stranded somewhere this would definitely be their first choice of where to get stuck!",1

"Never have gotten a good deal with these guys. Which is sad, I like their thin crust pizzas with all the meats, but this one seems to be way overpriced, so when that happens I search elsewhere, forget they screwed me, end up over in their parking lot and see their sign. My stomach over rides my brain and says 'thin crust' and i place an order (giving them another chance) nope... Screwed again, shame on me as I put my wallet in my pocket and now review this place as I wait. First as a warning for you my friends, but mostly as a reminder for myself that I'm an idiot for trying them again",0
"If your lookin for a good price, and not so much quality, then yea. This is definitely the place for you. Unless you are drunk, then I'm sure it tastes awesome.\n\nI've never had a good pizza from here, the toppings fall off before you can even pick to your slice.\n\nWe usually pick up our own pizza since its on the way, but the pizza seems like its been sitting out longer than the allotted 25 min.\n\nAlso, the chicken *poppers* are more like chicken nuggets, and not tasty at all.",0
"You really have to make an effort to find worse pizza.  Mediocre meats and veggies are placed under the cheese, making for a soggy, unappetizing pie.  I don't eat fast-food pizza often, but I have tried all the chains, and Papa John's is the worst of the bad.  Do yourself a favor and find a locally-owned restaurant that doesn't aspire to be the Wal-Mart of pizzerias. You'll find plenty on Yelp.",0
"Worst service ever! Apparently their online service was down? An hour later their pizza did not arrive, no phone call, no pizza ... Nothing. . .  And a charged credit card. Horrible. Called the closest store to find out they cannot deliver. And my card will still be charged. NEVER AGAIN will I order from papa johns... I suggest you don't either",0
"This review is based on how well the school prepared their past students for high school. My son just went to 8th grade there. \nIt seemed like a majority of the kids started at a very young age and goes there through junior high. Saying this, the school has one method and one method of teaching which I would say is not good for the student. The students will struggle once they leave the school cause they only understand one method. \nMy son was in the lowest pre-algebra class. He was struggling with the method because all the other kids grew up learning this method. The teacher Mr. Bitter even told our son that he shouldn't go into Algebra 1-2 in high school. Well he went into public high school and struggled a little but nothing a tutor couldn't help him with. He's now doing really well in Geometry. Another former student that was in the same grade as my son was in honor math. Anyways, they are now both in public school and the same Geometry class. My son is doing better than the junior high honor student. \nAlso, another former junior high student from the school was a honor student and went to the same public high school. After two weeks of school she was failing classes and moved back to PVCP for high school. This shows that they did not prepare the kids for high school. \nMy son is in honors Spanish 3-4 at the public school. He said that the 8th grade Spanish teacher was teaching the same thing as he is learning now in honors 3-4. This tells me the teacher doesn't know how to progress the students correctly. Don't just push them through a class but learn to teach. \nSo overall, I feel that this school does NOT prepare the kids for high school or college correctly. It was a big mistake to send my kid there. Save your money and send them to public school. If your worried about Christian values then teach them at home. That's what parents are there for. It's not the schools responsibility to teach these values.",0
Not going to explain. Just don't waste your time.,0
"Both of our sons went to PVCP since 1st grade. We found the teachers to be excellent. Our oldest son had a small class and was very well prepared for High School. Our youngest has some Mild ADD and a little different learning style. While  not all of the teachers were able to accommodate him most were more than willing to give him extra time and help with assignments. This school isn't for everyone, it is like a small town community, which we loved.",1
"What can I say???It's a gas station. Nothing too fancy, lol...\nIt's not the cheapest gas station and it's not the most expensive in town either!  It did however give me a problem taking my debit card at first but then it took it",1
I don't like any gas stations that have different prices for cash/debit/credit payments.  Why can't they all be equal?  Not coming here again.,0
"Ok, I wasn't expecting a lot when my husband and I wanted something quick to eat and a little different and our usual Rubios, but I should have trekked a little further to Pei Wei. \n\nI was craving pad thai and I knew this place had it, so I order that with no meat. I then asked if I could have tofu instead. The guy at the counter asked if I wanted the tofu deep fried. I said no and my husband ordered two egg rolls. The total was $19! I knew that was off, so when I mentioned it, he said that the tofu was a brick of tofu. I told him I didn't need a whole block of tofu, just some to put in my pad thai. He then said he couldn't do that? What?? You can sell whole blocks of it, but you can't put it in my food? I said no to the tofu and waited for our food.\n\nAfter we got home, I opened my food to find big chuncks of beef, chicken, and shrimp in my pad thai. I'm a vegetarian, so that's not good. My wonderful husband took it back for me and when he returned, I only ate about 5 bites. Wasn't good at all. Next time, I'll stick with Pei Wei. Maybe I'll have that for lunch!",0
"so, yeah. stopped by for lunch today, had the teriyaki chicken salad. not quite sure how this was a salad - 5 strips of teriyaki chicken on a bed of iceberg lettuce? ok, i'll concede that generally chinese food restaurants don't do salads well, but still. that was pathetic. chicken was fatty. sauce was flavorful. oh and my table had a funky plant/fake flower vase ... the green leaves were alive and in water, the fake flowers were mixed in with the live plant. weird.",0
"Unlike other parts of the country I haven't found too many take out/small eat in Chinese restaurants in the north Scottsdale/Phoenix area, but if want something healthy and reasonably priced Wang's is an excellent choice. This is not a fancy place but the food is tasty and healthier than fast food. Portions are ample. Family is very friendly. TV usually on if you eat in. Also some outdoor seating. Better than 3, I would say 3.75. Rounded off to 4.",1
"I read the other reviews, I don't see how they earn a three star. Maybe their attitude change for the worest; maybe its the summer heat, In my book that owner lady is definately NOT FRIENDLY !!! she is a bitch !!, she brought out the wrong oder, we took a few bit before we realizing it was not what we ordered, she insisted we pay for it anyway - because we already eat it (three bits worth). The man is nicer, he came out and take care of our complain. \nThe food is pretty much like other Americanized chinese restaurant. - Cheap and plenty.\nAs for me, I won't be back here again;  plenty Other good Chinese restaurant to choose from.",0
"BY FAR, HANDS DOWN, THE WORST CHINESE FOOD I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.  I wish I were joking.  I ordered the usual, chicken with vegetables.  It was taking a long time so I peeked back behind the window.  The \""""cook\"""", if you want to call him that, was just goofin off.  then he casually starts to throw everything in the pan.  It was awful.  Undercooked everything.  tough to chew.  obviously, it is a health hazard to undercook chicken.\n\nthe bathrooms were disgusting too.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS DUMP.",0
"Great Chinese fast food, order the house special fried rice, house special chicken and the house special lo mein, these are the main items that are pretty authentic chinese food. they are pretty quick and the food is always good to take home. don't go to the white man's buffet when you can get good quality fresh authentic chinese food.",1
"Honestly, I am surprised at the number of negative reviews for this place, but it seems that all the newer (2013 start and forward) have been positive, and we have good things to say about it too!  The pork fried rice is amazing and the pot stickers are a new fave also.  I will say that we are not huge fans of the lo mein here, but that is true of all the Chinese restaurants we have tried locally, so it really isn't that big a deal.  \n\nThe cashier is the same gentleman each time and each time he is unfailingly nice and smiling.  \n\nOther bonus features: the place is clean, the parking lot is easy to find a spot in, most people are taking to-go orders, so if you want to dine in it's actually pretty quiet, and it's next door to a Starbucks if you want somewhere to relax after in the now cooler air!\n\nOverall: A\nWe highly recommend the pot stickers and fried rice with any of the meat additions (chicken, pork, beef, etc.)",1
"The pot stickers and pork fried rice are amazing, making this our favorite Chinese place so far.  The lo mein and egg rolls aren't to my personal tastes, but I'm yet to find a restaurant at any price point where I love everything on the menu. The service is always fast, the people are friendly, and the food is made fresh to order. Can't ask for much more than that!",1
Didn't like the food at all. The chicken does not look like real chicken. Not sure what I was eating. Will not go back to eat here again.,0
"Very nice fast food!! Ultimate.. We had orange chicken, mushroom chicken, some shrimp with chau meen.. Everything was fantastic..",1
"Good food, haven't found a asian restaurant that wasn't overkill on grease in a very long time and I was pleasantly surprised with their food, not greasy, egg drop soup was awesome! They even have the little crispies to put into the soup which again is hard to come by these days!  So far so great! :)",1
"Horrible. Don't eat here. I had the curry chicken. It was fried and made with dark meat. Curry sauce was not good either. Kind of dirty inside the restaurant, very outdated. Seems like the workers are lazy.",0
"I have been going to this place for 15 years or more. I order the Sweet n Sour Chicken and Crab Puffs every time. I've never experienced poor service either. Large portions for not a lot of money, and it's fresh too.",1
Worst Chinese food (it doesn't even deserve to be called food) I have EVER had in my life! Buyer beware!,0
"California burger with fries and a vanilla malt.  This is one of my ideal hangover meals.  It's not a healthy place and service isn't completely outstanding, but it's a fun little diner for what it's worth.  I seriously LOVE their burgers even though they're way too big and I always eat too much and feel sick afterward.  It's awesome to sit and eat outside as well.",1
"This is a good place to go for breakfast or lunch.  I don't recommend their dinner entrees.  I think their pricing is high, but comparable to Coco's or IHop (around the corner).  Overall, very fast service, and hot food.  My favorite is their BBQ Burger.   They have good chili too.  Breakfast is the best -- especially their french toast.  The only negative is the lack of large group seating.  This location has booths, so they cannot put tables together (Camelback and Scottsdale can).  Also, they tend to seat people rather oddly which can leave a large group waiting for a long time.",1
"went for dinner on a sat night, was not very busy - seated right away.\nServer was very nice and on the ball, we enjoyed the food and the customer service! Will visit again!",1
The hamburgers are delicious the service was great the malts are the best,1
"I usually don't like to complain but this was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever been a part of.\nGranted, it was midnight and clearly the people working there got the short end of the stick when it came to their shifts but nonetheless, that's not an excuse.\n\n-Got there at 12:05, didn't receive our food until after 12:50.\n-Didn't bring all of the food out (clearly forgetting to place the order in the first place)\n-Overcharged us on the bill\n-Rarely checked if we needed anything (water, anything else, etc.)\n\nI wish I could say all of this wasn't on one dining experience, but I'd be lying. \nI like to keep things positive but I had to write a review.\n\nEat here if you're desperate :)",0
"We spent 10 days in Phoenix and ate out at tons of different restaurants with our 2 little kids.  I only wish that we had found the 5 & Diner on day one!  We had breaksfast here on our last morning.  Price and quality were fantastic, especially the kids' menu.  Portions were healthy, but not overwhelming...just right.  Loved it.  Service was great.  Friendly and accommodating.",1
Totally starving this morning.  Had to go to the store but it was closed.  Went to 5 and Diner at Tatum and Cactus area.  \n\nWe were taken to our table and it took 11 minutes to have any one come to greet us.  Slow service.  Then a waitress stopped by - took our order.  The food came out quick.  Had the 2 eggs with bacon and biscuits and gravy.\n\nI hate it when your eggs come out and they are crunchy....CAN'T ANYONE SEE THAT THEY WERE COOKED TOO FAST AND THEY ARE CRUNCHY..  QUALITY PEOPLE....  QUALITY!!!!!  yuk!!!  Picked around the crunchy parts. Bacon was good.  Biscuits were ok...  lightly dusted with gravy.  semi warm.\n\nNot a fan of this place.,0
"Carlos is the man.  He's worked here for seventeen years and he will make sure you have a good experience.  5 and Diner is a great choice for families.  The fifties themed decor is fun for all.  Just wish the juke box system worked. On my most recent visit I had to try to explain the concept of a hula hoop to a three year old.  Since a demonstration was out of the question, I'm afraid this little one will have to wait for later clarification.  She did enjoy coloring the paper hat the restaurant provided, however, and her folks enjoyed the $2.75 price tag on the generous junior pancake breakfast.  The menu also features a separate section for seniors.  While technically you have to be fifty-five to order from this section of the menu, in my experience servers will allow anyone who would prefer these smaller portions and prices to order them.  A note about prices.  While the kids menu prices are very reasonable, select off menu junior beverages are a bit pricey (juice $1.79) and can drive up your total cost.  There is also a loyalty card that will help stretch the dollar of frequent diners.\n\nThe Southwest Omelet was perfect on our recent visit and definitely worth a taste.  The pancakes were uniform and served hot. In all honesty, however, it's the decor and the friendly staff that earns the restaurant four stars in this review. Menu offerings are solid, with a few amusing names scattered throughout, but are for the most part predictable and basic.  But come to think about it, isn't that what you want from a fifties diner?\n\nEven though 5 and Diner is not a \""""genuine\"""" fifties diner, instead an Arizona based chain's recreation of the era, it seems genuine enough.  I've noticed that several locations have closed in recent years, but the PV location seems to be unaffected and thriving.",1
"We walked out.  There was no reason for the poor service we got this evening.  As there were very few people there, lots of open seats were available.  We were seated by the bus boy as soon as we got there.  Then we waited.  When everyone else is already eating 2 minutes is to long to make a table wait.  We left.  My wife spoke out about how this was her 2nd horrible experiace at this location in as many weeks.  Tonight she was feed b.s., l's and e's about how there was a credit card issue.  To us it looked as if our server was just goofing off not really caring if he waited on anyone or not.\n\nGood luck with dinner service here, We've never had this experiace during breakfast, so it'll stay a breakfast place, maybe lunch, but no more dinners.",0
5 and diner is not what it use to be. There place is becoming run down and getting dirtier an dirtier. The shakes use to be amazing but I'm guessing they changed ice creams or put more milk in to save costs because they are not what they use to be.,0
The worst service I have ever had and we were the only people in there! Chicken was burnt and had to scream at the waitress to ask her to fix it!!!! Could not pay me to go back!!!!,0
"I used to go to 5 & Diner a lot but moved out of state a few years ago. Visiting and tried it out again but its not the same. It used to be pretty good- good burgers, shakes, etc. Its just not the same. The quality went down and the prices went up. I was disappointed with the food. Chicken sandwich was dry, fries were old and my Dr Pepper was flat for some reason.  It felt like a restraunt on its way out.  I was with two others and they were also very disappointed.",0
"Hmmmm.. Nothings changed. Without milkshakes this place is no good. Too pricey for a diner. Thought the Turkey burger may be a good choice & it shows up with no cheese :( By the time I got that fixed, everyone else at the table was almost done eating.",0
"This is a great lunch spot since they are quick, have lunch specials and are consistently delicious.\n\nIn addition to a large Japanese menu, they have several Chinese dishes. The sushi is made to order and its preparation can be viewed via a large window up front. The lunch sushi specials are more than enough food for one person: Miso soup, large salad, two kinds of rolls.\n\nThe decor is pretty and tasteful without being too cliche. There are three dining areas: elevated with bench seating, front room with high tables and an outdoor Arizona room.\n\nThe pricing can be a little high ($7 lunch specials), but is reasonable considering the quality and consistency.",1
"Eastwind is great!  If you are looking for good, fast, and cheap lunch or dinner this is the place to go. They have awesome lunch and happy hour specials.  They have a large menu that includes sushi. I like how you just walk up and order and they bring your food to you.  Also the lunch waitstaff is suuuuper friendly and nice.",1
"I love this restaurant. Great lunch specials and a huge menu. Lot's of sushi specials. Fast service and a great lunch staff. Will definatley be back. Best kept secret in Phoenix. Express lunch service during the day and wait service in the evening. Several wines to choose from, also Sake and Japanese beers. Good happy hour specials 3 to 6 and 8:30 to closing.",1
"These guys have a good thing going and they work it like no other! The food is amazing, affordable and the service is perfect! I have been a long time patron of Eastwind (and Tokyo Express before) and can't say enough about it. You might not get as much of a kick out of this story but I do...\n\nThis one time at Eastwind... Michelle and I placed our order, filled our drinks and took a seat. A few minutes later a couple steaming hot plates of food were gently placed in front of us to enjoy. I dug right in and Michelle began adding some of that orange spicy stuff to hers. After a couple light mixes of her fork, she noticed something black just under the topping on the rice. After further exploration, she pulls out a metal screw.\n\nNow, I stop for a second here to mention the open environment at Eastwind. The entire kitchen and Sushi preparation areas are fully visible from just about anywhere in the restaurant. As well as all of the tables are visible and within earshot of a fairly well spoken voice.\n\nJust as Michelle pulled up the screw and showed it to me, the lady at the main counter looked up and uttered a very noticeable \""""Oh!\"""" She rushed over and profusely apologized, whisking Michelle's food away (with the screw) and offering to take mine as well. I declined and watched her walk away back to the kitchen. Within a minute, we hear a shout from the kitchen. One of the chefs holds up a fry pan and the infamous screw, showing us where it came from (the handle). Then he holds up a large garbage can to show us, sets it down and drops both the pan and the screw into it.\n\nBy this time, the rest of the people in the restaurant had figured out what was going on and, seeing the chef drop the pan, began to laugh and applaud. We felt the same way. It was a simple mistake but it was dealt with elegantly and thus adds to our long list of reasons of why we love this place.\n\nOf course, to add to the experience, we not only got a replacement meal very quickly but both of  our meals were completely free. Needless to say (whatever you think of my experience), I think there was no better way to deal with the situation and hold true to our loyalty.\n\nEastwind is more than a restaurant, it's a tradition!",1
I am a sushi lover and this place does it just right! \nNot only are they extremely affordable but the happy hour is phenomenal! From 4-6 and 8:30-close their sushi rolls are about 2 bucks and saki bombers (ichiban beer and warm saki) for only 5 bucks! \n\nThe cherry on top is definitely their A+ customer service. They are always friendly whether you are dining in or just taking out. \n\nI recommend this place as the #1 Japanese restaurant in Phoenix!,1
"I ordered the Bento B and it wasn't too bad. A nice assortment and a decent amount of food. The salad was a joke like most places, consisting of a few slices of carrot and all the white parts of a head of iceberg but hey it had deep fried shrimp on top. The real issue was with Stars meal. She ordered the tempura roll which she made sure to question if it had any meat products in it because she is a vegetarian. The waiter said no and we moved on. She also ordered the fried tempura which comes with its own dipping sauce. Secretly only for the lotus root but you now only get one slice of that and the rest is egg plant. \n\nWe had made the assumption that after the initial conversation regarding vegetarianism that it would apply to each item ordered there after unless explicitly obvious by including the name of the animal product in its general description. \n\nAlas the dipping sauce does have fish sauce in it. When we mentioned it to the waiter he agreed that there was indeed a fish oil. ( I immediately pictured them just squeezing the fish gently and letting it go to extract the fish oil. ) To which my wife points out that fish are not a vegetable and the retort from the waiter is that he is not up on the lingo and most of his vegetarian friends still eat fish. \n\nThe future is bright :/ \n\nThe bill ended up being a few cents under 30$ with the three items and a Kirin.",0
I ordered an eel roll off of their happy hour menu and I was really impressed. It was like 4 bucks! Good mix of quality and price. I will be back here for sure.,1
"There are some upsides to this place, such as decent lunch and happy hour specials and friendly wait staff, that make this an acceptable destination for a quick working lunch or a 6 Sapporo / sake, edemame and California Roll dinner. Anything more than that is sure to dissapoint anyone and everyone with an even remotely refined taste for Japanese cuisine. The sushi, sashimi and specialty rolls are generic and uninspired. The attention to detail, care in preparation and harmony of flavors - that generally make Japanese cuisine so special - is altogether absent. And the freshness, or lack thereof, is downright concerning. All of this is especially disappointing because this is such a good location and space for a quality Japanese place.",0
"This was some of the worst sushi I've ever had, especially for the money. I could barely get it down. The place is dumpy and depressing inside. All around terrible.",0
We ordered carry-out and after getting it home called them to say they left out portions of the order.  We were transferred three times and after talking to the third mouth-breathing Tween hung up.  Won't be back.,0
I've been coming to Eastwind since it was Tokyo Express years ago.  I love this place although I never eat the sushi.  I love their miso soup and their teriyaki chicken.  It's always consistently good.  My boyfriend usually gets the bento box which he loves and allows him to sample a variety of different foods at once.,1
"My less than stellar review is for service.   We waited 30 minutes for our meals to be delivered.  When we questioned the waiter, he was not helpful, so we asked to speak to the manager.  The manager did not even come to speak with us!   We were loyal neighborhood customers, even walking to the restaurant frequently!   My husband then wrote an email to the owner, and it was ignored by him as well.   This is obviously a business that does not value customer service, we were very disappointed and Eastwind has lost regular customers",0
"I went to Eastwind for happy hour with my book club. The sushi menu was tasty, not huge but enough of a selection to cover the basics. The service truly friendly. This place can accomodate big groups and has a great regular menu - I am excited to try it again. This time for dinner.",1
"Not a great experience last night at Eastwind. I'm going to start this by saying that I've been eating here for over 20 years, when it was Tokyo Express and now Eastwind. I was a customer weekly when I lived closer, now it's every 60 days or so.\n\nWe went for dinner around 8:00 and it took way too long to get seated in the half empty restaurant. We were seated next to a family that must have been friends or family with one server, as she was constantly at their table. She was there while we were waiting and obviously saw us before finally showing us to a table.  Our server was a guy that must have been new, as he seemed very nervous and didn't know the menu.  \n\nSo we ordered the sushi sampler for me and the Korean beef and a veggie roll for her. I got the sushi, but not the salad and soup that it comes with. The veggie roll turned into an egg roll. Everything came at once, and the server didn't make his return until we were done. After consulting with server #1, he took off the egg roll and our drink. Guess that's supposed to make up for it....",0
"we have been dining there for years & enjoy our meals !! They have great soups & salads as well sushi- the menu selection has a huge variety, so there is always something for everyone- The service is always excellent & the prices are reasonable-",1
"Came back for another bento box - this time the miso soup was really delicious!  Everything else was just as good as before if not better, even the salad dressing was better.  Still super cheap, still great.  Love it!",1
"I've been eating here since it was a Tokyo Express. The specials and Happy Hour deals are the main reason I go these days. The California Roll is my favorite. Teriyaki chicken and sukiyaki are my favorite main dishes. The shrimp tempura and Gyoza are my favorite starters. \n\nThe servers are hit or miss. It's a bit strange. Order at the counter, get your own drinks, then they bring your food to the table. Shrug.",1
"My husband and I considered ourselves regular customers, but not anymore. We learned the owners changed last month and we've noticed the change. The servers are not very experienced and have a lot to learn about customer service.\n\nThere must be a new sushi maker because the California roll we ordered looked awful. It tasted okay, but there was something off about the presentation. The couple sitting behind us also had a problem with the California roll. We both ordered the Tokyo Chicken Slaw and it took forever to get to our table. The chefs must still be learning how to make all of the dishes.\n\nWe like going to Eastwind because of the location and the food. Now we'll start going to Cherry Blossom more often for our Japanese fix.",0
"I have eaten here multiple times and expect much better than my visit today. The person taking orders seemed inexperienced, plus he didn't know what was in several sushi rolls and had to actually open a menu to check. Since their lunch menu has changed, I ordered the chicken teriyaki with brown rice and the California crunchy roll. The Cali roll's crab filling seemed dry, and the teriyaki sauce left something to be desired. \n\nA few hours after lunch there  I began to feel nauseous, sick and feverish. I had chills and fought nausea for a few hours before it subsided. \n\nI think this place has gone downhill even though they have tried to make it more upscale. The prices have gone up, but after my experience today I can see that the quality has not followed suit.\n\nFor $10 I would have rather had a sushi roll from Fry's at Tatum and Shea.",0
"Although we have been regular customers of Eastwind, that changed approximately 2 weeks ago.  My kid and I went to get some California Rolls and it took more than 25 minutes and 5 complaints to 3 different employees to get our food.  It's not like it had to be cooked.  I even yelled out my complaint so everyone in the restaurant knew how upset I was.  When the food was delivered, it was almost thrown at us.  \n\nI asked to speak to a manager - but there wasn't one available.\n\nThat is one restaurant that I will no longer frequent. Go there at your own peril.",0
"Came during happy hour.  Prices are great!  Wish they had hard liquor but I'll get over that. Was looking forward to a dirty martini .  Tried about 6 different things off the happy hr menu.  All were really good especially for the price. I've had better and better presentation but also paid lots more.  Atmosphere is nice and relaxed.  Wait staff especially our waiter ( Roger ) was amazing! Friendly, helpful and great sense of humor. Can't say I'll be back as I'm from Austin; just here for spring training baseball .  But customer service excellent and if I lived here it would be a regular.",1
"This is the deal and a very honest review no BS but the truth.  I have gone to Eastwind for years and the food was always decent.   Fast food sushi and a good place for lunch.     Well the place was just purchased by a new owner and the guy seems to not give a crap.  Never once has he come over to the table and said how's your food etc.   The people are not very friendly , and this is the honest truth.   I have been there about a dozen times since the new owners purchased it and they have not gotten the food order right once.  I order the same thing every time  a teriyaki chicken combo and a Mitzu soup with a drink.  One would think the soup would come out first but nope.  It all comes out at the same time and the last few times the food has been cold along with the soup.  Do they EVER APPOLIGIZE nope.  They really don't care and if they don't care I will find another place to go.  They just lost a two to three day a week customer.  Today was funny they forgot to bring my food out after waiting 20 + minutes.  They double delivered an order to the guy next to me.  Another table had to go up and complain three times to get their order.  It's like a circus of errors and comedy.",0
"It is evident there is new ownership and until they get their act together I won't be making my twice weekly visit.  When we were last there the place was cluttered with plastic plant paraphernalia, my first clue.  A preteen girl was serving the food-and every table I spotted received the wrong order-or waited over twenty minutes for their food.  Our order was incorrect-and way below standards.  It is the end of an institution- that started out as Tokyo Express in this space-and transitioned to Eastwind-with solid food at good prices.  They have lost two longstanding customers-and I don't doubt the regular customers will do the same.  Hope springs eternal-and perhaps the new owners will care about the customers and get organized.  I still see some of the previous employees working there-they are the only link to helping the owners get the food and service back to par.",0
"Disgusting, gross, unedible.....I've never been so disgusted by food in my life. Ordered a simple tuna roll, the roll had a really fishy smell and the avocado was hard. One bite, threw the rest away, wasted my money but at least I didn't get sick! \n\nThe staff was very nice and friendly but I'm not going there for that!",0
"I came here for Father's Day. This used to be one of my favorite restaurants and I never had any complains, but today. We came in, and ordered our food. The restaurant wasn't packed like usual. I got a cup to get water but then juice came out. My dad told the cashier who answered \""""oh we don't have any more water.\"""" wow.  We get to our table and we didn't need to wait awhile for our eel sushi which was mostly just rice. My dad received his curry  rice....Worst presentation and not appealing. My sister's order comes and the waiter's fingers were black and dirty was touching her rice and tempura. I asked him if they had new management and he said it's been a month. So that explained it. I feel bad for the owner.. I wouldn't be surprised if this restaurant closed down.  It is so obvious that the employees hate their jobs. Nobody smiled except one lady. They were rude and just looked real unhappy. I saw the cashier talking down to the Japanese cook. Anyway so they close at 8pm today and a couple comes. I asked if they were the owner and they weren't. I told them it was because if they were I wanted to tell them about our experience. So anyway after 15mins, the lady stands up and says she didn't get the right order, that her dish tasted like they put vinegar in it and that  they forgot her order and when she asked about it the cashier said it was because they came in late. She ended up asking for a refund. I am never coming back to this restaurant ever again.",0
"Never again!  This place is a mom and pop fast food catastrophe.  Sushi this is not.  Do not have sushi at this place.  I dont know how this place has survived.  The location must be keeping them alive.  Im sure locals dont eat here.  I am usually a fan of mom and pop restaurants but these people are in desperate need of help.  I am not here to give restaurant advice to restaurants.  I am here to warm people of bad food.  You've been warned Do not eat sushi here it is not good, fresh or worth it.",0
"This place used to be a great inexpensive dive to grab a bite with friends. They got rid of table service, so now you must order food and drinks at a counter. What little staff that are still there seem to be inexperienced and nervous. Food quality has gone down yet their prices have gone up ruffly 35 percent. You are now paying Kabuki prices for no service, blah food quality, and a busted up environment. It's a real shame that this place fell apart.",0
"We have been going to Eastwind for years and have always enjoyed it. I'm not sure what has happened recently (I heard new management? ) but it has been going down hill fast. The final straw was when I went in on a Sunday evening to order a simple teriyaki chicken bowl and was charged over $12! I asked why and was told the \""""bowl\"""" is now a lunch menu item and dinner is a \""""combo\"""" with a salad. When I got my to go order I had to ASK for the salad (after all I did pay an additional $6 for it). When I got home I saw that all the SMALL (4\"""" \u00d7 4\"""" container)  salad is was only lettuce with lots of bad celery- I took two bites and threw it out! The chicken was also just blah.  So disappointed.  I won't be back.",0
"Eastwind is a regrettable experience which sushi enthusiasts should avoid. This most recent incarnation of this Asian restaurant model is a significant downgrade from the quality delivered by the previous owners. \nLooking for a small meal, we ordered three rolls: spicy tuna, spicy yellowtail, and a Philly roll. \nThe spicy tuna was passable, but the oiliness and lack of freshness of the spicy yellowtail was appalling. The color if the yellowtail was darker than I had ever seen before. The salmon in the Philly roll was drab and lacked freshness/flavor. \nThere is no alcohol available at the moment, so you are well advised to head to the supermarket for sushi and Japanese beer for a better experience. \nFrom an ambiance perspective, the place seemed dingier than I had remembered, with a two story ladder visible to many of the diners. \nEastwind used to represent decent sushi and fish/veggies/rice at a reasonable price. It no longer delivers that level of value.",0
"Whoa what happened!!! I used to goto this place weekly, but the new owners really messed up a good thing. Prices have almost doubled and the food is not as good as before. Also after a 20 min wait they still managed to bring me the wrong food, same for my wife's order. Too bad as this was my go to place for lunch. Sorry 8 bucks for a small rice bowl is not worth it.",0
"I'm only giving it one star because i have to! LISTEN LOUD AND CLEAR NEW MANAGER/OWNER - THIS PLACE OFFICIALLY SUCKS!  I have been going here since it opened at a Tokyo Express (and had been going to the Camelback TE since it open). Don't know what this guy was thinking when he took it over than \""""Oh, how can i provide the worst food and expensive prices\"""". Well you succeed. The staple of this place is terriyki chicken and rice - it now swims in sauce and you must pay a dollar extra for brown rice (she did not mention that to me when she took my order). The small salad was $1.20. Now, by small I mean TINY  use to cost 50 cents... he achieved his goal there. My daughter had fried rice - now we have had fried rice there dozens of times but this Mensa member decided that making it spicy, adding peppers and onions would be good....NOT! And seriously - the decor - OMG!!! it  looks like Goodwill threw up. i will never ever step foot in that place again! BARF!",0
"The rolls were not well prepared. the salmon sashimi was not cut properly (A little skin was left on). On the plate with it was a bed of lettuce that looked a little old (probably due to the sauce they put on top). Also on the menu they stated they had beer and sake but their liquor license was revoked. They couldn't serve it. Finally while eating, they were cleaning tables, which I appreciate, but all I could smell is bleach. Overall I will not be going back to this location.",0
So I haven't been here in a long time and I was very disappointed with the food. Apparently they changed owners a couple months back and he changed the food. It doesn't taste as great. They changed some of the sauces which I was not happy about. And now the prices are doubled. The new owner didn't seem that nice. He was acting like he was above everyone else. I don't think I will be coming back.,0
"This restaurant used to be 4-5 stars for us, but with all the changes in pricing, taste and recipes, unfortunately, yesterday would be the last day for us.\n\nWe ordered Champon and Nagasaki Sara Udon. Although the taste of Champon went down, it was ok to me, but Nagasaki Sara Udon was not good. They, for some reason, changed the noodle from thin \""""deep fried noodle\"""" to just boiled Udon, which is not Nagasaki Sara Udon anymore.\n\nAlthough it is not really close from where we live, we would probably go to Cherry Blossom in Phoenix when we want to have decent Champon and Nagasaki Sara Udon.\n\nIt is regrettable to see this dramatic change of quality in the last several months.",0
"The sushi was stale, old and gross. There are no waiters, customers have to order at a counter, get there own drinks and serve themselves.",0
USED to be great!!! I don't know what happened. Please bring the old Eastwind back!!!!,0
Yikes! I take back my last updated review. They changed ownership and it's NOT good. :( \n\nNo more wait service. Instead you awkwardly order at the counter.\n\nPrices have gone up drastically! \n\nPretty much the same menu but it tastes different. Not nearly as flavorful. My sushi roll was quite sloppy. \n\nNo booze! Booooooo. Supposedly they are waiting on a liquor license but if I had a buzz I probably would have been much more forgiving of the experience. \n\nI will still give them 2 stars because the counter guy was nice and the food was edible. But it was a bad experience... Usually when my husband and I hit up their happy hour we pay under $25 for tasty nibbles and a few alcoholic beverages. This time our bill was almost $40 for similar items but not as tasty but without the booze and without table service. Boooooooo!,0
"Sushi and service here are always great, but the new sushi chef takes it over the top! Delicious rolls and really good yellowtail sashimi! I'll continue to be back here often!",1
"WARNING **THEY ARE PRIVATELY OWNED NOT BY TOKYO EXPRESS** have come to this location for YEARS! I have always been very pleased with the food and the service. This time, it was HORRIBLE. The Manager Jung, was extremely rude and not at all helpful. This place changed ownership a few months ago which means smaller portions for more money. Sue was the ONLY saving grace of this place. I will not return to location as well, I will advise friends and family to do the same. The regular bowl for Teryaki Chicken used to fill me up with left overs for approximately $8.10. Now the \""""plate\"""" is 10.00. Imagine only 6 medium sized strips of chicken with 2 huge scoops of rice. Fill half of the plate with the salad and thousand island dressing and the other \""""half\"""" with rice and chicken. The food quality tasted the same but amounts were different. I requested why this change took place and the manager Jung said \""""Eastwind has ALWAYS served on plated with half salad and have ALWAYS charged $10.00\"""" Not only was I upset about the amount of food for the price, I was now extremely upset at the tone and way Jung spoke to my family and me. I do not recommend this location any longer but should you go... Ask for Sue. She is a sweetheart older woman that ordered me another bowl to say sorry for the way her family member Jung treated my family during this visit. We came from Anthem and feel this just is not worth the drive any longer. Steer clear folks if you were a regular at some point... not at all the same.",0
"I work nearby so I was hoping for the best. \n\nUncomfortable bench seating.\n\nBizarre order at the front protocol but the kind manager/server said he would serve me at a table. \n\nThe place smelled like old people and looked dirty and unkempt so I knew off the bat that I wouldn't order any raw fish.\n\nThe guy who took my order was really, really, sweet and accommodating. But sadly, everything else was pretty bad. \n\nThe shrimp tempura roll was somehow gross due to the rice not being cooked right and the crab tasting fishy. My water came in a plastic cup. There were crumbs and water stains on the chairs around me. \n\nThe Pad Thai was downright DISGUSTING.\n\nToo much fish sauce? The fried tofu was COLD TOFU that exploded with cold water when I took a bite. (SO freaking gross.) I took a second bite of noodles and it did taste like fish sauce and was luke warm. I took a bite of shrimp and it tasted freezer burned. I spit it into my napkin and lost my appetite.\n\nAt the exact moment I spit the shrimp into the napkin my server walked up. I told him the truth about the shrimp and tofu and he did not charge me for it and offered to bring me something else. I told him I had to go back to work so I would just finish my shrimp tempura roll. He was so sweet he sent me off with a small soup and salad which was nice since I was sure I would be hungry again but honestly I couldn't bring myself to try it after how the other things tasted.\n\nMy Pad Thai was also supposed to $11.00. Kind of outrageous for lunch. \n\nI wanted to like this place because I really liked the service but the food was just SO bad. It may have been my worst experience eating out ever in terms of taste and quality of the food and surroundings.",0
"The food is always fresh & reasonably priced. Try one of the great Bento Boxes for a quick, nutritious lunch! I have been coming here for years and it's never disappointed me. Try Eastwind, you'll like it, their portions are great and you definitely won't leave hungry.",1
"I feel bad for this place, I just ate a chicken bowl and my stomach is gurgling, not a good sign. When i was here 5 years ago, the food was great. Now its basically teriyaki bowls and sushi. Things are more expensive now, rivalling Stingray, which is worth the price. The atmosphere is cluttered with obnoxious signs everywhere in bright colors, the menu is glued to the counter with plastic covering it. I felt like i was in Tijuana! The counter help even called my order to the kitchen in Spanish! Not a good sign. There were also three TV's with three different things playing...At least they have China Mist tea. It is the only thing worth ordering, sorry to say.",0

"Since new ownership, this place is horrible. Customer service is non-existent, with the daughter behind the counter not even greeting customers or saying Hello. Only given 2 soy sauce packets for 3 meals (after asking multiple times for it). The restaurant was very dark and gloomy to go with their extremely rude employees. Will NOT be back.....EVER.",0
"I ordered a mozzarella and tomato sandwich, a small order of pasta salad, and a drink and it came out to $13. For $13 I could of gone to a restaurant. Paradise Bakery has some of the best cookies around but the food is a rip off.",0
dude their salads are awesome that's all i get here for 7 bucks plus tax they are a bit pricey but if you can deal with that than its good stuff oh yeah the cookies are bomb too haha i have returned to this place many times,1
"Great sandwiches for lunch, offering artisan breads and fresh garnishes. Hearty soups and salads are also available; check out their Lenten specials this time of year.",1
"If you're a part of my family you know that no holiday is complete without a Honey Baked Ham.\n\nWe came in here to purchase a ham for Easter and I was really surprised by everything they had to offer other than ham! All these delicious looking condiments and RUM CAKE! \n\nIt took us awhile because we had to look at everything they were selling. Eventually we picked out three different style condiments; Spicy Chipotle Mayo, Honey Mustard Mayo and Horseradish Sauce. \n\nWe arrived at the counter and asked the gentleman a couple questions about the ham we wanted to purchase. He said he was a new employee and would find out the answers for us. I really appreciate that he was willing to step away and help a customer other than just attend to the register.\n\nHe came back with the answers we needed and we decided to buy an 8 pounder. \n\nAs always the service we received was fantastic and the ham tastes delicious! I would like to come back here to try some of the sandwiches they have to offer, and buy a rum cake!",1

I always get the Bistro Turkey and Brie which consists of smoked turkey, creamy sliced Brie, lettuce, tomato, Tangy mayo, dijon mustard, all on Sourdough bread. Yeah enough said I know....but I also had a great potato salad to go with it....and a cup of ice cold lemonade. \n\nAll of this for less than 5 bucks....that's right less than 5 bucks....the sandwich is great...the establishment is clean....and the customer service is top notch. So if your ever in need of a great Turkey sandwich look no further than Honeybaked ham company. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my friends!!!!",1
"We;ve all seen the lines around the holidays when people are waiting to pick up their hams for a holiday dinner. \nWell, they have cafe's as well, and their sandwiches, soups and salads are wonderful. \nIf you are looking for a great place for lunch, try it! It's delicious!",1
"I wish there was a grade lower than this for this total rip off place.\n\nThe week before Thanksgiving my wife and I were having her niece and family over for dinner.\n\nWhat better than a real, honey baked ham, right?\n\nWe went over to the Honey Baked Ham Store in Paradise Valley on Friday and picked one up and bought three sides, mac and cheese, au gratin potatoes and baked apple slices.  The sides were a whopping $30.  The ham $56, but hey it's family coming.\n\nWhen Sunday came along, we followed instructions, heated the ham and sat down to eat.  The ham was extremely dry, salty, tough and fat. Totally inedible, The sides, no better than Kraft or Marie Calender in quality and hardly enough to go around. Everybody was disappointed and couldn't wait for desert.\n\nSo, I went back with the awful ham in hand on Monday to get a refund.  Waited at least twenty minutes to speak with the manager.  He handled the refund himself, but would only give me back the $56.for the ham.  He grudgingly said he had credited us back on the the American Express card we used to pay originally.\n\nJust got our Amex statement,  Not only didn't he credit us back at all, he charged us another $56!!!.  So we are now out over $140 for a meal no one could eat.\n\nWhen I tried to talk to the manager again yesterday, some one over there said he was too busy to talk and would call us back.  And of course that never happened.\n\nMy advice.  Want a good ham and want to be really overcharged?  Go to AJ's.  At least you will get something to eat for your money.",0

"Sure if you have a crazy craving for a weird pie Marie Callenders would be a great place to go, but other than I wouldn't recommend it. The food here isn't great, and I would even consider it overpriced for what you get taste wise. Also the real reason I wanted to review this place is the service here is just awful. I have only been there about twice in the past two years, but both times the service was just REALLY bad. I mean these servers were weird and did not know what they were doing.\n\nPlease Marie Callenders start screening your employees!",0

"The Beautiful Carin and I had a wonderful Saturday evening at the Sunnyslope Art Walk. We had a nice dinner at Corbin's and as we were driving home, we talked about stopping for piece of pie.\nI like pie...it's not always about the cupcakes or gelato and ice cream, or even the \u00e9clairs and cannolis. \nSometimes it would just be nice to have piece of pie and cup of coffee.\nI was back east recently and it struck me that you can't walk 2 blocks in a lot of cities in the east without going by a decent diner where you can stop in and get a piece of pretty decent (maybe even homemade) pie and a cup of coffee...not here.\nWe could only think of a couple of candidates...Village Inn or Marie Callender's (neither chain had we been to since we left California, in late 2003). Neither was really appealing, but the lure of pie is strong...too strong! \nGPS said that Marie's was closest and on the way home.\nGPS did not say that this location stilled smelled of stale cigarette smoke from 2 years ago.\nGPS didn't tell me that the reason nobody was at this place at 9:00 in the evening was because it just isn't even very good pie, anymore (or, more probably, it isn't very good anything anymore).\nGPS tells me about traffic ahead and bad weather, but it just doesn't do a very good job of warning you about crappy restaurants!\nIt was dark, kind of smelly and over air-conditioned in Marie's, but we pressed on regardless. Once seated, our waitress came by. \nShe didn't seem pleased to find out that we were only there for pie and coffee (I can understand...there only seemed to be 3 tables occupied in the entire place). She was however, pleasant, and for that I tipped big, since it looked like we were her best prospect for decent tip on Saturday.\nI believe that Marie's used to really think their claim to fame was their pies...I know they were touting \""""whole pies\"""" in the signs as we walked in, but if this is still their big deal, then I am reasonably certain that I don't want anything to do with anything else they make/replicate/serve/unearth at Marie's. \nThe pie was no better than you would find wrapped in cellophane next to the cash register at Circle K. The coffee was even worse, if that's possible.\nHard to say what happened, but the crust was dismal (I don't think I'm a pie snob, but the Beautiful Carin is a baker of the first order, and she makes a vodka crust...that's right, you heard me, vodka crust, you replace  1/2 of the water in your crust recipe with vodka...that's to die for, and I would hurt someone that tried to take one of Carin's pecan pies away from me...I actually growl like my dog: ). \nThe filling in Marie's pies was even worse than the crust...just way too sugary, with no flavor except \""""sweet\"""" and no body at all.\nI like pie! \nSadly, this wasn't it.",0

"Very disappointing experience. \n\nLooking for a place for my dad. Went in on a Saturday and they were closing early (10 minutes after we arrived) so they were in a rush. J. at the front desk gave us an application and insisted that they needed a money order to hold the apartment for my dad, felt like she couldn't get us out of there fast enough. \n\nReturned on Monday morning and gave the completed application and money order to O., who apparently is the manager, not that identified herself as such while we were there. She actually did not tell us much of anything, except at the very end, she told us it was Affordable Housing. I have no idea what that means, and it isn't posted anywhere in their office or stated anywhere on the application paperwork. I literally have no context for what the means in that moment or that he needed to qualify for his apartment.\n\nLater in the week I called to find out when we could get into the apartment and waited on hold for almost 10 minutes (not like \""""oh it was a long hold\"""", like it was literally 9 minutes and change that I sat on hold). Apparently my dad had made some errors on the application and they gave his apartment away - no one called us, no one notified my dad that he'd have no place to move into 3 short days later and there are no other apartments for him in the complex. That was it, they just gave it away and didn't bother to tell us until I called.\n\nI emailed them 2 days after that asking them to mail my money order back. Today I sat on hold for 11 minutes to find out it still hasn't been mailed. \n\nAbove is all fact, now for my opinion: The people who work here are miserable, careless and disconnected, going through their job duties like apathetic robots, and I feel dismayed that our tax dollars subsidize this place. Don't bother with this place, get a roommate, look for other Affordable Housing options, whatever you need to do. This place has bad energy, not worth it, no matter how cheap it is.",0

"Their service is horrible which is a surprise because nobody its hardly in there. I visit a VS store 2-3 times a month.  I came into this site it was bout really packed I needed help and was ignored the whole time. Someone came in I heard the \""""Welcome to Victoria Secret,  can i help you find anything\"""" it kinda felt like a slap in my face. When I was paying for my stuff the woman asked if anyone helped me.  I had explained to her that everyone ignored me when I seeked help m the service was horrible. All she did was continue to ignore and have a dude conversation. I ended up leaving the stuff I was going to buy because I was so disgusted.",0
"If I could give this place zero stars, I would. \n\nWell guys, I just got back from Victoria's Secret and same old same old.\n\nI HATE coming here for a number of reasons.\n\n1. Does anyone ever work here?? Every time i walk in theres like nobody working. i will see 2 girls at most and their always busy helping other people or \""""pretending to look busy\"""" .. If i am lucky enough to get someones attention and speak to an associate there always so DAMN rude!! Some things i've noticed with the sales associates are their middle aged woman trying to be \""""sexy\"""". Excuse me but its not my fault that your a middle aged woman working retail in a mall, so please change your attitude towards me and give me some service.\n\n2. Whenever I find what I need theres hardly ever any selection, they are always out of my size or color or style and im left with the leftovers. \n\n3. the victoria secret deals are complicated at this location. i always have a problem whenever i bring in a free panty card or a ten dollars off card. etc. they always mess up my transactions and i always have to return and fix it. and when i do try to come back and fix it im left with their attitudes again like they didnt mess anything up? i remember one time i came in and asked a sales associate if this deal was still going on where if you spend a certain amount of money say 70 bucks you get a free duffle bag.. she said yes so i did some shopping and went to check out. when i got to the register the lines were soooooo long. when i finally made it to the front and made my purchases i had noticed that the lady had forgotten my duffle bag so i went back to the store and politely told her and she responds \""""oh we ran out\"""". excuse me?? If you had ran out of duffle bags why didnt you tell me when i had asked you when i walked in the store?? I was so angry.\n\n\nthis is my 6th time coming back here and idk why i do, i guess I just have some sort of hope that my next visit will always be better. but no, eek, me thinks not.",0
"Before now, I've never been ignored by sales associates when the store is virtually empty. Maybe the exhaustion from all of the weekend's sales drained all of the sales luster. Despite my fitting room request light being lit for over 5 min with no attendant ever coming to my assistance, I still managed on my own. Spending over $100 at an establishment deserves at least a little customer assistance.",0
"For reasons I can't explain, they choose to clean the soft ice cream machine on Monday which means you can't get any on that day. Even though I didn't walk in until 8pm and they clean it in the morning. Doesn't sound like a good business decision to me so until that is resolved, I'll get me soft ice cream some where else. too bad because this is so close to my house.",0
The worst ice cream shop ever!! We ordered two scoop sundaes and they were the SMALLEST scoops I have ever seen in my life! I use to love that place. What happened??\nNot to mention the girl that helped us was a little rude. \nThis is the second time we went there and had a bad experience. We will not be going back. Beware everyone!!\nCold Stone Creamery from now on.,0
Very friendly staff.  We had chocolate malt and half chocolate/Jamaica shake.  Both were delish.,1
"Greeted by Sean courteous & professional. This was my 4th attempt to get my hair shaped after a hairstylist with 16 yrs exp literally chopped it all off after I had been letting it grow out. That was in Nov 12', another stylist in Dec 12', another in April 13',  After 7 months, 3 so called experienced  stylists and $160 I took yet another chance.  I sat in the waiting area looked at style books, watched people coming & going and listened, I wasn't in any hurry. This young man Sean was the one stylist who totally impressed me. That was 3 weeks ago and i am very happy with my hair and very pleased with my new stylist \""""Sean\"""".  Sean listens and asks questions.  Sean, thank you.  I will be back.",1
They need to fire that bitch Ashleigh. ...I did not tip you today because of the stuck up bitch attitude you had with me & with the mother and her sons before me.,0
"We're currently one third of the way through our lease and I cannot wait to move out of this place. The property looks nice enough and the grounds are well kept, but our experience here has been lackluster at best.\n\nThe staff is rude, for starters. They don't handle complaints in a gracious or timely fashion. We had an issue with a drawer in the kitchen that kept tipping in. They came out five times before I gave up on that. Yes, it sucks, but that's par for the course here. \n\nLast Monday, something caused a flood in the bathroom/hallway/kitchen area after hours. It took the on-call maintenance guy over an hour to arrive, and he couldn't find the source of the flood, which had thankfully stopped at this point. The carpet person arrived another ninety minutes later, ripped up the carpet, sucked up the water and set up a large fan. By Thursday, I was asking the office when they would be replacing said damaged carpet. They told me that they would just be cleaning it and not replacing it. They also said that I told them the source of the flood was the second bathroom's toilet (I did, really? It's good to know I live in Imagination Land.) On Friday, I went into the office again, and they told me they'd be out to clean it that day. Right around closing time, the carpet person's assistant showed up, removed the fan, and did no cleaning or tacking down of the carpet. He said he didn't know he was supposed to do those things and didn't have the materials to do so. Finally, eight days later, they have tacked down and cleaned the carpet, after much nagging by me. I have never had to work so hard to get basic service from an apartment complex.\n\nIn addition, they do not keep track of packages in the office consistently, and I have had mail go missing on more than one occasion.\n\nThey also roll water and sewer into your rent price. They recently raised this, so our rent went up, mid-lease. I am disturbed by the fact that they can change what we pay pretty much whenever they like.\n\nPros:\n- Close to shopping and grocery stores.\n- Easy to get in and out of.\n- Relatively quiet.\n\nCons:\n- Rude, non-responsive\n- Things don't get fixed properly.\n- Price may change.\n\nEDIT: The complex changed ownership at the end of my lease, so this review may be completely outdated at this point.",0
"I got an AMAZING move-in special, and a very competitive rent considering the location and amenities.  One of the things that sold me on this place was actually the very sincere and accomodating customer service I got out of the people running the show.  I also love that there is washer/dryer in the unit.  To me the convenience factor is worth at least an extra $50 a month.  I am within biking distance of Target, Wal-Mart, Chase, Chipotle, TJ Maxx, Whole Foods, and Paradise Valley Mall ... and that is just what I've discovered so far having been here a week.  Everything is in one place, and there are probably half a dozen bus routes close by too.  I specifically like Route 39; it travels on the 51 between the mall and the Central Avenue downtown area.",1
"Lived at this place for a year, it was the best apartment-renting experience I've had since moving to Phoenix.\n\nI'm not sure if I got some deal or something, but I'm paying roughly the same to live down in an apartment in Tempe which is terrible and doesn't have the amenities of The Enclave. The apartment I was in included a washer/dryer and the on-site gym is really easy to get to, clean, and has adequate equipment enough that I didn't need a gym membership at any of the nearby price-gouging gyms.\n\nAnyway, to the brass tacks- I was paying about $640 after taxes. This to live in this uppity area, with Paradise Valley Mall and four grocery stores all practically within walking distance. \n\nThe staff was kind of hit-or-miss, but okay. Anytime we had a maintenance issue they helped pretty much immediately. The only snafus were once when my lady had a minor altercation with a staff member who refused to turn off the loud TV when he was working out in the gym (which is odd that a staff member was doing so) and once a mailed package was lost despite being signed for by a member of the staff. Not sure if this was more UPS's fault or the staff member's, though. Still irritating.\n\nFor the price, though, this was a steal for renting in this area. Apartments are nice, the neighbors we had were mostly cool, and I didn't have to worry that my girl or I were gonna get jumped or robbed or something like most other areas of town.",1
"Clean, classy, and like a blast from the past.  \n\nI have fond memories of visiting a See's Candy store as a kid -- smelling the fresh chocolate and letting my gaze wander over the amazing selection of chocolates.  \n\nNot much has changed in 20-30 years.    And to be honest, I think that's a good thing.  \n\nThe showroom might seem sterile and, well ...  'white'.  (Almost like a really clean and spacious bathroom).  \n\nBut be sure to ask for whatever samples they might have available -- they won't even make you buy anything (but I dare you to walk out without giving some of your money to those nice old ladies that work behind the counter).\n\nI've taken my two daughters there (11 and 8) and they keep asking me when we're going to go back.  The staff at See's Candy's really seem to know how to treat kids nicely.\n\nI'd give this place 5 stars, but their prices are a bit high.  You do get a quality product, but you definitely pay for it.",1
The ideal place to buy a hostess gift. Good candy of all kinds from a reliable chain. Staff helpful. Decent parking except when neighboring pizza place uses up all available parking for a couple of blocks. Schedule accordingly.,1
"I just went for the very first time. I was having a nostalgic moment and decided I would hit the local branch near my home. Growing up, my mother bought several Kinds of Easter Candy that were always in the basket. Then she continued the tradition with my children. My mother passed away 8 years ago and this year I suddenly remembered the candies. I went in last week and immediately spotted the candies. The service was delightful and they seemed happy to help a newcomer. I mailed all the candies to my grown children who were delighted with the memories created of their beloved Grandmother. I'm really happy that I sauntered in and I plan to continue the tradition as well as starting some new ones.",1
"I am a big fan of this restaurant. The location is not so great...just a strip mall, but I think their food is excellent. We are vegetarian, so we get the same thing every time we go...split the cheese enchilada and cheese tamale plate. It is so good. We also love the chips and salsa and margaritas!!",1
"This place is overrated,  the food is NOT authentic at all.  California is where the real Mexican food is.",0
"Great looking place, expected a really classy experience.  What we got was a waitress who didn't introduce herself or greet us, clear our plates or fill our drinks.  What we also got was food that would have been just slightly above average had it actually been hot.  The food was lukewarm, refried beans had a burned taste, chips were stale, the fried ice cream was obviously fried a few days ago so it pretty much just looked like a big ball of ice cream that had been rolled in cornflakes.  Not to mention we didn't get the extra garnishes the table next to us got.  We won't be going back, there are way too many other places that are worth the money.",0
"My Wife and I had dinner there, very colorful place at first, seemed like it'd be good. They model themselves after a real Mexico City restaurant, and I'm not sure what that's all about! Food was bland and boring, and I didn't find it to be authentic at all. Service was OK, it was very crowded, but that didn't hinder the waitress. Won't be going back.",0
"I'm pregnant and craving Mexican.  I hadn't been to this restaurant in years and decided to give it another try.  Being on a budget, I didn't have that much to spend on lunch for my boyfriend and I.  First thing that turned me off was printed in the menu.  Only 1 refill of the chips and salsa before they charged $1.99 for more.  Also, only 1 refill on drinks (which were absurdly expensive for iced tea and lemonade: $2.25 each).  Any restaurant that charges that much for drinks and limits your refills to 1 turns me off, especially here in the desert.  My boyfriend had a chimichanga with shredded beef which was pretty good and I tried the enchiladas with \""""mole\"""" sauce.  It was absolutely disgusting.  I sent it back and asked for chicken enchiladas with green sauce.  Decent, but not worth $10.49 they charged for simple enchiladas.  The chips were nothing to write home about, honestly a Fry's bag of $1 would have been much more appealing.  The salsa (a trio of regular, green and hot) was bland and tasteless, albeit spicy (which didn't help my sudden need to suck down the limited drink I had ordered).  I am reliving the food even now as it gave me horrible heartburn and left me feeling extremely nauseas.  I will never be going back, ever again.",0
"I don't speak Spanish so I'm not sure that my girlfriend's translation of La Parilla Suiza to English as \""""Our food tastes like when you throw up in the back of your mouth\"""" is correct. We had some chicken enchiladas with green sauce on the recommendation of our server. Being a gringo I expect my enchilada to be a corn tortilla filled with some gooey melted cheese and if ordered with, some meat. These were corn torts with a dab of chicken inside them, topped with a green sauce that had no heat but a lot of twang. Though given the flavor of the enchiladas I was happy that there wasn't much there. \nAs for the service, we didn't see him again after the food was delivered until done and ready for the check. The carafe of water left on the table appeared to be a Star Trek collectible as it had food particle klingons. But hey, no server to complain to so I guess all is good.",0
"I have lived in Arizona for 25 years and the first 15 years in Tucson.   I have been going to your restaurants for all of these years.   It used to be my favorite Mexican restaurant, I can tell you now it has fallen not only past the bottom of my list but completely off the list of not just Mexican Restaurants but all restaurants.   I will not come back, nor will I ever recommend it.\n\nHere is what happened.    We came to the Tatum Blvd one Sunday evening about 6pm.    There were maybe 10 tables with people, not busy at all.   I was with my wife and 2 kids, we were seated right away and our waiter was nice enough at first.    My son ordered the #52 as he always does, my wife ordered #24 but thought she was ordering #21, my daughter ordered her customary Cheese quesadilla from the kids menu and I ordered #39 (thought I'd try something different.).   First off my sons, silverware was dirty, (set ups) he simply took some from another table, seemed like not a big deal at the time.   Then when my wife's meal came 5 or so minutes late after everyone else's it was the Vegetarian Burrito not the Fajitas she thought she ordered.   Rather than trying to make it right for her the waiter became argumentative and told her that is what she ordered and gave her no option.    What makes this interesting is she ordered it as #24 but said to the waiter she wanted the Fajitas.   Her mistake but is the customer always right?  Should the waiter try to make her experience correct even if she made the error?   Should we have had the option of getting her the meal she wanted-even if you offered at a cost to us?    I did get my order and it wasn't as good as I expected but it was what I ordered, 1 BIG Standing tray of food, but not a Plate to be had.   Consequently, I dropped a Chorizo covered spoon on my clothing because I had this elevated monstrosity of a serving dish in front of me but no plate to eat of off.     Lastly but probably the most important was my son's dinner.   It seems he had a HARD FOREIGN OBJECT in his re-fried beans; it looked and felt like a pebble.   We pointed that out to our waiter, he response was: \""""I'm sorry.\""""    I would have thought we'd see a manager by that point but we did not.   I would think a HARD FOREIGN OBJECT which  was clearly not food in my son's beans warranted a free meal if not our entire bill given as complimentary.   You could have had some expensive dental work to pay for.   \n\nHere is the deal.   I am not happy, my wife is not happy, and my son is not happy and begged us not to go because we have had either bad service, messed up food orders, plus I have even had Chicken bones in my food in the past.   In fact I remember a time when he ordered #52 with beef before got it with chicken instead and they brought him an entire 2nd meal because of the error.    My 9 year old daughter is the only one in the family that likes it; plus it's pretty had to mess up a Cheese quesadilla (her order every time).   Here's the other tidbit of knowledge she doesn't get to be the one who buys dinners out, I am.    The consumer votes with dollars and I will cast my vote to not spend them in your restaurants again.  \n\nPlease let me know your thoughts I am very interested to know.   I paid with a credit card the bill totaled $49 and I tipped only $5 because of the sub standard service, I am sure you can find my order in your records.   I have probably had over 100+ meals from your restaurants over the years and I must say the Phoenix stores or should say at least the one at Paradise Valley Mall is terrible.   I don't think I ever had a bad meal at the Speedway location but I moved to Phoenix over 10 years ago and do not go to that location any longer, I cannot say the same for this location.",0
"Some of these previous low ratings surprise me, as my wife and I have been eating here for years. I have never had them limit refills on drinks ever. One waiter is not nearly as efficient as the others but he is the only one. \nThis is not a Tex-Mex joint so if you want their best do not order chimi's, enchiladas or fajitas. They have many other excellent choices. May I suggest combinations plates number 15 and 34 they are always superb. For the week day lunch special I always order the beef alambra tacos. The bacon puts them over the top. The Queso appetizers are artery clogging but excellent.",1
All I can really say is that it's a family favorite.  My husband's family is completely addicted.  They all have their favorites.  I'm still working my way through the menu but the fried ice cream is always our go to dessert.  And the margaritas are a nice complement to any Mexican meal. :),1
"I was very skeptical of this place because I am normally not a fan of strip center Mexican food places.  This location isn't the newest and nicest but it is definitely a solid joint and far exceeded my expectations.  \n\nOur server/waiter was fast, friendly and courteous.  The chips and salsas brought to the table when you sit down were fresh and excellent.  I especially loved loved loved the red one.  I bought a pint to take home to put on EVERYTHING.  There is just enough spice and great flavor.  There is some secret ingredient but I can't place it.  We also ordered the melted cheese thing for an appetizer and it was awesome cheesy goodness.  Next time we are going to order it with green chilies.  \n\nMy wife and I split the \""""Fajitas for 2\"""" with 1/2 chicken and 1/2 steak.  I thought it was excellent.  The meat was tender and juicy and there were plenty of sauteed onions and peppers throughout.  There was also more than enough for 2 people.  The flour tortillas were also fresh and delicious.  Their guacamole was less than stellar however.\n\nThis is probably one of my favorite local Mexican places and I can't wait to go back.",1
"This place is right in my neighborhood, but I always seem to forget it's there! Finally tried it out last night and I was very impressed. I LOVED the trio of salsas they serve with their chips...especially the green one! It is fantastic and so flavorful. I ordered chicken enchiladas with green sauce, and they were delicious. Normally enchiladas come drowning in cheese, but these one were not and you could really taste the flavor of the enchilada sauce. Their charro beans were very good as well; definitely a nice alternative to refried beans. I can't wait to go back here and try some of their other dishes!",1
"When I crave Mexican food but don't want something smothered in cheese and grease, I come to La Parilla Suiza.  I have been here several times, and everything I have had has been great. Most recently, I had a cup of the chicken and rice soup, and a fajita taco a la carte. My husband has the bistec (sp?) tacos. He really liked them.  This place is not too filling and yet you feel very satisfied. Its pretty cool too because you get to watch the guys making everything through one of those glass windows.",1
"So disappointed. I moved to Arizona from California last year and have been searching everywhere for some good mexican food without any success. Yesterday, two of my coworkers were talking about this restaurant and its tortilla soup and cheese appetizer and tonight we decided to try it out. \nPros- good chips and salsa. my corona was ok too. fast service but I hate when servers do no clear the appetizers, dirty plates before the main course. And then give the check without clearing the table.\n\nBad- the FOOD !! tortilla soup was okay, really nothing special, I would not order it again. I guess when I think of tortilla soup, I expect cilantro, onion, chips, chicken but it was just broth and chips and cheese.\n\n We ordered the cheese and mushroom appetizer since my coworkers recommended it. We had a few bites of thick cheese and we were not impressed. tasted like canned mushrooms and bad cheese. We ate about 1/3 before just letting it sit there.  Main courses arrived and while they looked pretty, my swiss enchiladas with red sauce were GROSS. I took one bite and made a face. The sauce tasted very ketchup like and the chicken had no flavor. Beans were floating in broth and tasteless... like watered down bbq beans. I got about 3 bites into my 3 enchiladas and just gave up. My bf's shrimp tacos were better and had a few bites of his.\n\n\nOverall, 40 dollars for us to eat and the only thing that were good were the chips. I'm not sure why my coworkers liked it but maybe its because I am used to good Californian Mexican food? Sigh, still looking for decent mexican food here in the valley.",0
"What a waste of time/money. The menu pictures of the food look delicious, but what I got was completely different!!!!! \n\nI wanted it to be tasty....but I got some slapped together shrimp tacos with...white rice? White rice and butter. Crunchy..BLEH.\n\nI was expecting lots of shrimp for the expensive plate I bought. I got tiny little shrimpies....DON'T DEPRIVE ME OF MY SHRIMP! I love shrimp. Anyway, so bland....no flavor....so LITTLE food....I am not one to eat a lot, I just was expecting a bigger portion for what I paid for\n\nI feel like a jerk every time I rate a place low. But The thing is, when I dislike something, the first thing that comes to my head is: I gotta tell other yelp about my terrible experience!!!",0
"I was not impressed at all.  I expect Mexican food, whose flavor foundation includes garlic, chiles, onion, and lime to be vibrant, but my cheese enchiladas were completely bland.  My peach margarita tasted like sugar water. \nThis restaurant proclaims itself to be \""""Mexico City Food\"""", but the menu seemed to be comprised of boring Mexican chain restaurant standards.  I was left wondering what was supposed to differentiate this cuisine from other Mexican restaurants (I presume La Parilla Suiza was simply trying to state that it's not a TexMex restaurant).\nWill not be returning.",0
"Incredible food. Tortilla soup that is legend and the paradillas are amazing. Not much ambience from a strip mall so don't come for the romance, just incredible food.",1
"We've been to a closer La Parrilla Suiza before, so when it turned out that we could get diner miles by going to this one, we thought we'd try it, even though it's much further out.\n\nMaybe they had an off night, but I had some serious issues with hygiene! I'm not usually too fussy on this kind of thing, but the tables were dirty, there was old crud and new food stuck all over the table and in the grout lines of the tiled table, the floors had clearly not been cleaned in a while (food from previous diners was still all over the floor) and the toilets were in a terrible state of disrepair!\n\nOne toilet was completely blocked, another was covered in excrement and the sink wall had some kind of damage too, like a chunk off the wall missing. There was water/pee and toilet paper all over the floor too!\n\nWhen my daughter and I returned from the restroom, we told the waiter what state the ladies was in and he somewhat grunted in acknowledgement, but when my daughter needed to go again before leaving, nothing had changed.\n\nThe food was ok, but to be honest, I had a hard time enjoying it.\n\nWe won't be returning!",0
"I LOVE the food, the service is always good, the chunky and the green salsas are amazing and the tortilla soup is divine!  I could eat here every day if I could afford it...both financially and at my waistline!",1
"I don't know what kind of crack some of you are smoking to say this is \""""just like Mexico City food.\"""" It isn't.  Mi esposa, si, es del D.F., y hemos comido en muchos lugares alla, INCLUYENDO La Parrilla Suiza.  Which means, my wife is from Mexico, Distrito Federal, and we have eaten in many places there, INCLUDING the original Parrilla Suiza locations en el D.F.  This place is NOTHING like those del D.F.  This is an attempt to \""""hoodwink\"""" gringos who don't know any better.  Whilst the fare is quite a step up from Serranos or Garcias, it really isn't all that much better, the prices are a bit ridiculous, and the service leaves a lot to be desired.  As far as I can tell, the only similarity between the US and D.F. locations are the logos on the outside walls.  Not a big fan of false advertising.  If you want real comida del D.F., go to Los Reyes de la Torta.",0
"The value, the food, the Happy hour, the service, you can NOT beat it!!  They give you three sauces with your chips, a salsa, pico de gallo and some sort of guacamole  dip.  Trust me, it's ALL amazing!! No, this not a five star but if it's lower prices and yumminess you are after-Go Here!!!!!  Nothing like this compares to most places in Colorado, my husband grew up here a d was very impressed!  And if you enjoy the Alcoholic beverages please try the Widow of Oz drink, it's a twist of the Margie.  I thought it would be sweet and I\n can't handle sweet but I had two and now hubby is saying 'I am sweet'  lol\nEnjoy!!!!!!!!",1
"Wow, this was tasteless food. Even the salsa for the chips was thin and tasteless. I had a carne asada burrito that was dry and 90% tortilla. The rest of the table \nexperienced the same thing. Eat somewhere else.",0
Excellent service! Food was delicious. My date and I shared the tortilla soup and the server graciously brought out an additional small bowl without us even asking. The enchilada con mole was fantastic! The side of beans that came with it reminded me of my Mexican grandfather's recipe and brought back great memories. We will most definitely be going back very soon! Highly recommend!!!,1
Food here is awesome!!!!! What I recommend is the Mole enchiladas !!!! Yum,1
Great experience selling my Gold Wing on Consignment.  Didn't want to sell moved out of state and the comfort of Don and the crew was great.   Received a check for a fair amount and they took care of everything.  Thanks for the great experience.,1
"I am never going to this Lenscrafters again. The service is awful. I've been a customer for several years now and I've put up with 30 minute wait times for far too long. They need to staff this store with more associates. The latest incident occurred when I went in to order replacement lens for teenage son's glasses. Luckily they were still under warranty, so it as only $25. But, just to order the lens, my son and I waited 30 minutes. We tried to place the order, then the computers were down. So we had to move to another station. The lady was also trying to help another waiting customer at the same time. OK, lens ordered. She told me to take home the frames because they didn't need them yet. They called, I went in to pick up the lenses. The lenses hadn't been cut down to fit the glasses yet, so after yet another 30 minute wait, I found out I had to come back an hour later. Well, I work for a living and I'd already spent my entire lunch hour waiting to pick up my lenses. So I go back at 3:30 figuring it won't be that crowded. Wrong. Yet again, I waited 30 minutes. Finally, they give me my glasses with the lenses fit in and I was so aggravated I stormed out. I'm also going to write a letter to the corporate headquarters. We've been to one other lenscrafters location in PV mall and it didn't seem as bad. But regardless, Lenscrafters has now lost three customers because three people in my family wear glasses.",0
Dr. Jesse Dominguez was beyond awesome. He made me feel so comfortable and explained everything and answered all my questions. I couldn't have asked for more! He gave me contacts to try the same day and they feel amazing and are so very comfortable. Five stars for him!,1
The staff is nice. Big selection. Cleaned and tightened my old pair while I was shopping for a new one.,1
Love this school and would highly recommend any one who has children to attend! Amazing and loving staff!,1
"Wonderful daycare/preschool. My kids have been there for 2 years and we have had great experiences with all of the teachers. They have a Christian environment which at this age is perfect for any religion- a good foundation of bible stories, God and kindness which we can build upon at home.",1
"Just as others have said I would really give this place 2.5 stars.  However I leaned more towards 2 than 3.\n\nThe establishment is located inside the Hilton by the airport.\n\nI ordered the fried calamari which was over breaded and simply ok.  I also ordered a pint of Guinness.\n\nThere were only maybe 7-8 other ppl in the whole place yet when I finished my first pint i had to wait 10-min before I was asked if I wanted another.  And I was seated at the bar!!!\n\nSo food get's 2.5 stars, service gets 1.5 for an average of 2.\n\nI didn't have a rental car and didn't feel like cabbin it even tho other joints were only 2 miles away.  Not having to leave the hotel counts for a lot!",0
"This place offered a pretty good selection of breakfast, lunch and dinner.  The breakfast was my favorite.  They had a buffet for about 15 bucks which included juice, coffee, eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, pigs in a blanket, ham, omelette station, Belgian waffles, a variety of different breads, and muffins.  I say give it a try.",1
"Overall restaurant experience was bad. This is based on 3 factors:  Food quality, decor & service. The taste of my hamburger was very bland. The fries were soggy and room temperature at best. The decor was something from the far past. Dark interior and uninspired menus. Lastly, the server was the redeeming quality. She was nice and somewhat prompt and I'll leave it at that. In summary these 3 factors contributed to a unpleasant dining experience and I cannot in good faith recommend this place as a destination for dining.",0
Good service and fantastic steak sandwich.  My girlfriend had the burger and loved it.,1
"The food here is a mediocre 2.5 stars at best. A lot of it was fried and while they do have a few salads and few special daily entrees the food was still sad overall. I had the Caesar Chicken wrap one night with underdone fries...it was OK. I also had the Chicken Primavera pasta which was actually tasty but needed way way more fresh veggies to make it somewhat healthy...they really skimped on the fresh ingredients here. Other than that the chicken strips, onion rings, fish filet and the like were all super fried. The chicken or veggie quesadilla were also OK but I'd just hop a cab anywhere for something a little fresher.\nThe beer lines seemed stale here so I'd order the bottles or stick to cocktails which were made well.\nThat aside the staff was all friendly and on top of things.",0
Service is almost always slow and food is just okay. Even my beer was warm tonight. Kinda of pricey but what do you expect out of a hotel restaurant?,0
"This large, airy hotel restaurant is a good local lunch spot for something a bit more healthy than a burger. Our waitress was prompt and efficient. I was impressed at how knowledgeable she was when I asked about some menu substitutions.\n\nMy friends and I each had a salad. Mine was a big, fresh, and tasty oriental salad with mandarin oranges, romaine, and water chestnuts. The peanutty dressing came on the side without me asking, which I absolutely appreciate. They also had an option for marinated and then lightly sauteed chunks of tofu as a salad add-on (I don't care for chicken), and it was quite good. The marinade tasted like a light soy. I'd definitely have it again.\n\nIn case the listing info isn't clear, this restaurant is located in the Hilton Phoenix Airport, on the north end of the building.",1
"Very courteous staff and more health conscious options than is usual- even for California! They sat us with a smile 10 minutes before the breakfast buffet was over, and, along with the regular fare, there was soy milk, tofu scramble, tons of fresh fruit, granola, and oatmeal with all the fixins... Rennick's for the win.",1
Stick with sandwiches.  Everything else is so-so.,0
"Typically I've come here to eat during the day and get taken care very well by a very nice and wonderful waitress, Anita. After this experience I refuse to go back unless she is the one waiting on me. The food here is great but the service can certainly be lacking. The waitress tonight was certainly busy but she didn't even make an effort to check up on us. That is even after I had to go to the bar and get a 2nd round of drinks for me and my fiance. I didn't get guacamole with my entree like I was suppose to and couldn't even get any ketchup for her fries since it's like we weren't even being waited on. I don't know if possibly we were being discriminated upon for having a Groupon, since she was checking up on everybody else and would just walk right past us. I still tipped cash but below the norm of course, and wrote on the tip line on the receipt \""""disappointed\"""" since the service really was.",0
"We ate at Rennick's restaurant, with some eager anticipation because we were hungry and the menu looked decent, and it was our only option (nothing else within walking distance of hotel). We sat outside in the lovely and peaceful courtyard by the fountain. The waitress was very earnest and sweet. I ordered a Tuna MELT with sweet potato fries. Everything on the plate was cold, though the plate was warm. There was a sprinkle of cheese on the top that looked like it was broiled for 20 seconds to brown, but even that was cold. I asked the waitress to have them re-heat the sandwich, and maybe put a little more cheese on the top. She returned with the cold sandwich and cold fries. She told me that the chef said 'that's how the sandwich is supposed to be'. She even came out with another waitress that affirmed that the tuna melt is supposed to be cold: \""""it's a tuna salad and comes cold\"""". I pointed out that my fries were cold. The waitress reached over and grabbed one from my plate and said \""""yeah, it is cold! I'm sorry.\"""" She came back later and said that the manager was running to a meeting but would take 10% off for me 'for the inconvenience.' I would have rather had some warm food! I tried to be a good sport and eat it, but it was unappetizing so I left it uneaten. Having to (mostly) pay for the food I did not eat, with not even a token attempt from the restaurant to try and fix it or get me something I liked? Total let down.",0
I would give negative star I could. The menu pricing is not in line with what they charging. This is illegal and unethical. I will report this to BBB and state commerce.,0
"Oh my gosh....I am sitting in my hotel room right now and want to SCREAM. \n\nI am paying 275.00 a night for the Presidential Suite which is very large but oh so very outdated. The fixtures are all from the late 80's how i know is because there from the same year I was born! Its horrible! The Spa was full of spiders and orange....pretty sure it was white at one point. All the fixtures in the \""""wet bar\"""" are like a Taupe/Pink/Mauve and are squeaking soooooo loud right now! I feel like I'm on the set of Pretty Women urgggg I hated that time period! This place could be GREAT if they did some updates! \n\nSince its Thanksgiving no one is working and the High Class much praised kitchen is closed! At the friggin Hilton its closed! I could have stayed at the Ritz Carlton for less down the street but since my grandfathers High School reunion is here we figured why not....Cant be that bad I mean for crying out loud I'm used to Motel 6! \n\nThis is pretty bad! \n\nHowever what staff they have left down there is pretty nice!",0
"I'm so split on this place, because I kinda don't want to like it, but as a Hilton HHonors Diamond member, I get the perks that make it pretty awesome.\n\nFor example, like most other Hiltons, there isn't a complimentary breakfast.  What a dick move for an upscale hotel, right?  Well... wait wait wait HHonors member, you get exclusive access to the Executive Lounge on the 4th Floor for a lovely complimentary breakfast with eggs, potatoes, maybe some other hot foods, muffins, bagels, doughnuts, fresh coffee, juice, yogurt, and a staff member there just for you!\n\nOh, and don't forget that we have a lovely, HHonors member only evening reception with libations on the cheap and some lovely finger foods - sandwiches and such.  Relax after your long day, and partake in some CNBC or other hi-def programming on one of our HDTVs\n\nBack in your room, $9.95 for a day of Internet access?  Not so, HHonors guest!  Type in your information and we provide you 24 hours of Internet access completely gratis.  (And surprisingly, for non-free Internet access, it's not particularly fast.  I was only hitting 0.5Mb/s down)\n\nI get giving your best customers special perks, the evening reception for one, but some of these really should be perks for all guests.  I will give the Hilton Phoenix Airport a lot of credit otherwise.  The staff is incredibly friendly.  They have a complimentary shuttle that will take you to several nearby locations.  I've made a few trips to Chase Field when the shuttle drops me off and picks me back up from the 44th and Washington Valley Metro Station.\n\nThe rooms are fantastic.  Clean, well appointed (I'm sure it's those fine, European linens, Serta mattresses, and Crabtree & Evelyn soaps), HDTV in every room.  One big criticism is as of my latest trip in August 2011, they've disabled the TVs from switching to a secondary input - alas, no plugging my PlayStation 3 into an HDMI input for some gaming/movies/Netflix.  A second criticism, no mini fridge or microwave in the room.\n\nThere is an amazing fitness center.  Plenty of room, full rack of dumbbells, benches, treadmills, ellipticals, weight machine... Needless to say, it's well equipped.  The pool is also pretty big - long enough to get a few good laps in without crashing into kids.\n\nThe price on this place is always reasonable, especially compared to other hotels of its caliber in the area.  I still prefer the Doubletree up the road, but for the price, this is a decent choice if you have an HHonors membership.  Otherwise, I'd suggest trying someplace else.",1
"A sad homage to the Hilton name.  $9.95 for 24 hours of .5 meg internet connection was the straw that broke the camels back.  Noisy air conditioning, a funny smell, analog cable on beautiful HD TVs. Everything done half-way.  The only saving grace to this stay is the free parking and shuttle service to the airport. Even at the discounted rate we paid, not super satisfied.",0
"I don't know what I like better about this hotel: The artwork which would make the creatures from Stephen King's nightmares seek PTSD therapy, or the fact that my room smells like someone set fire to a used diaper. \n\nNext trip to Phoenix, I shall be staying anywhere else.",0
"The corporate rate we have in the summer cannot be beat and the concierge lounge for diamond members is stellar!  The rooms have been updated and are comparable to updated Hiltons.  I love its' proximity to the airport and location for me to get to work.\nThe only reason why I don't give this place a 5th star, is for location.  There isn't a running path from its door and I haven't been able to find a restaurant that suits my fancy in the nearby vicinity (though I haven't tried the restaurant in the hotel either).  This location and quality cannot compare with the hotels on Camelback.\nI will stay here again in the future, but in the meantime, I am going to try out some other Phoenix hotels..",1
Bug in my veggie sandwich from the bar :(,0
"The room and staff were great.  Great room, clean and up to date. The restaurant there is anything but good. It is mediocre at best and very overpriced.  I got a Ruben sandwhich which I had to spit out- seriously.  It was thick meat and undercooked and grizzly. Awful. I have no taste of Russian dressing.  Room great... Food is horrid.",0
"This is a dilapidated pile of horse caca.  It's old baby.  Really old!\n\nIf you don't travel often and rarely stay in hotels, you won't notice how bad this place is.\n\nHowever for you business travelers and especially you Hhonors Diamond members, you'll leave wondering how this hotel retains it's Hilton status!\n\nI mean COME ON.  In the Hilton family, only Waldorf-Astoria is supposedly superior to a Hilton branded property.  I suspect that this hotel is owned by a franchisee and not Hilton Group.  It's so poorly managed it's laughable.\n\nI wandered in unsuspecting but questioned the landscaping outside as I passed by.  The bark in the landscaped areas was almost completely gone and what was left was so badly faded and destroyed by the sun it should be removed.  Bare dirt would look better.  Or better yet, put in some landscape rock.\n\nThe lobby, upon first glance, appears clean and modern.  However, since my check in took over 20 minutes due to the 'trainee' assigned to me, I had time to look around.  A lot of repair work needed to walls, carpet, tile, etc.\n\nOne of the elevator doors was severely dented... as if kicked in by an unruly bar patron from the lobby restaurant.\n\nMy room was OLD!  The bathroom is old school TINY and barely enough room for one person.  The door to the bathroom covers 3/4 of the shower so maneuvering around is difficult and can be dangerous getting out of the shower.\n\nOne good thing about these old hotels is PLENTY of shower pressure and water volume.  Hot water in the morning remains limited.  Shower early!\n\nThe room is scuffed up pretty good and could use new wall paper and a paint job.\n\nDresser drawers slide open and will not remain closed.  Having to use the bathroom in the middle of night and running into an open drawer is extremely frustrating.  Especially when it happens a 2nd time.\n\nNewspaper outside the door in the morning a nice touch as many Hilton properties have quit doing this.\n\nAirport shuttle runs every half hour.  Don't be alarmed if you wander out their early to find 30 people seemingly waiting on the shuttle.  They scoot people back and forth to the University of Phoenix campus at about 20 after the hour in the morning.  A surly, overweight retiree who only speaks in grunts and barks will be happy to tell you how stupid you are for trying to board the shuttle to the college instead of waiting 10 minutes for the airport shuttle.\n\nThe nice thing was when he returned to take me to airport.  More grunts of dissatisfaction when I responded with \""""Terminal 2\"""" to his question \""""Which airlines\""""?  I knew right then I was going to save a few dollars in tip money when he dropped me off.\n\nThere's 5 Hilton properties surrounding the Phoenix airport.  All of them are better than this one.\n\nAVOID!",0
"Purchased a deal through Expedia and was EXTREMELY disappointed with my stay here!! Do yourself a favor and AVOID this hotel. You are better off staying at a Motel 6. \nUpon checking in, it seemed as though Expedia had messed up in this case. I had made reservations for 2 beds but had one bed which was not the hotels fault, and the guy at the front changed right away... 5 stars for this. When going into the room, I had noticed an empty half-and-half and an old water bottle by the bed. At this point we were way too tired to care or complain about this. The next morning I had found out that I only had breakfast for 2 which I had for singed up for 4 on Expedia. The manager at the restaurant took care of this for the first morning after they had embarrassed me in front of my guests, but our amazing waiter Ron made up for this so Ron gets 5 stars. We got back to the hotel room and I had not noticed this before but the blanket was stained!! So gross so at this point I had enough. I had called Expedia which they told me to make a complaint with the hotel and then went down to speak to the manager, Jackie. Jackie had a \""""wonderful resolution\"""", she told me I can call Expedia and ask them to relocate me! Seriously?!!! And this is at a Hilton?!! Great customer service....I seriously don't know why this woman went into a career in hospitality but obviously should not be in this line of work. In conclusion, I have realized that Hilton's standards have gone down the toilet and to stay away from this hotel at all costs. The only redeeming part was our waiter Ron.",0
Been calling for the last 30 minutes to find a family member that is residing there with no answer. Not what I expect and highly disappointed.,0
"So, after putting in a complaint with Hilton, I received an email back basically blaming Expedia. My email only briefly mentioned the confusion with the continental breakfast but mostly described the filthy room, and the way the manager handled my stay. I sent an email back on 12/23/13 explaining all the complaints I really had with the hotel and never heard back! Great way to stay on top of their customer service! Well on a positive note, at least I know not to even consider a Hilton as a venue for my wedding... or as a hotel choice EVER",0
"Let's be honest: Airport hotels reek of desperation.  No one stays in an airport hotel unless they have to.\n\nHowever, the Hilton Phoenix airport can barely be called a Hilton.  \n\n1) It is in the middle of nowhere.  I hope you like mediocre, fatty, fried food because that's all you are going to get unless you take a cab.  The two hotel restaurants have very limited menus. If you have to stay here, eat at the airport first. \n\n2) The room is old.  Furnishings look like dogs have gnawed on them for a while.  The padding under the lamps is gray from dust.  \n\n3) The bathroom was clean but it had paint peeling.  What Hilton do you know of has peeling paint?\n\n4) All of that for $133 a night.\n\nI was too tired to complain and honestly don't think other rooms were any better.  In my desperation for a place to sleep after my flight was cancelled, the hotel was okay.  But I wouldn't stay there again.",0
"This hotel is old and needs to be updated, I stayed in a room over the staff work shop and it was very loud. Beware this hotel is near nothing if your lucky you can get a shuttle but be prepared to shell out some$$ for a cab ride back.. After complaining to the front desk they did give me some extra Hilton point  but it still cost me $139.00 a night",0
"The room was clean, and attractive. The person at the front desk was very friendly and helpful. They have a service where they will take Hertz car rentals back for you, which was very convenient. \n\nI am giving this hotel two stars though because they charge $10 per day for WiFi, which is a disgrace! Last night I stayed in a La Quinta Inn, which cost one third as much as this Hilton does, and they knew that WiFi is supposed to be included in the room charge, the same way that a TV connection and running water are included in the room cost. Hilton needs to get its act together; because this is pathetic.",0
"We stayed at the Hilton Phoenix Airport hotel for one night on our way back to Philadelphia from Hawaii. We weren't planning on staying over in Phoenix, but with many flights getting canceled due to the snow in Philly, we decided to delay our flight and spend the night. \n\nWe just spent a wonderful week at the Hilton Waikoloa, and my husband stays in Hiltons for work several days each month-- so we really trust the Hilton brand. Sadly, however, our experience at the Hilton Phoenix Airport hotel was an exception. We were quite surprised by the poor quality of the hotel all around. \n\nFirst, our flight arrived at 9 AM, so we knew we had several hours until our room would be ready. We asked the front desk if we could check in early (before 3), and they said that they would try to have a room ready early but that there would be a charge for early check in. We realize that there is probably a policy that states we should be charged for early check-in, but we have never, at other Hilton properties, been told we had to pay extra for that. We elected not to pay extra, and as there is nothing really in walking distance, we spent the morning and early afternoon in the common space of the hotel. There is an outdoor patio/pool space that has the potential to be very nice.\n\nHowever, the hotel property is dated, and is not kept up. Some examples of things that made us cringe: There were drink cups left laying around for the entire day, there was a big pile of cigarette butts sitting on top of one of the umbrellas by the pool (see picture), the room, when we eventually got it, smelled like bad body odor, there were (ketchup? coffee? blood?) stains splattered on the curtains in the hotel room (see picture), and the balcony facing the freeway and parking lot was tiny without enough room to sit. One of the worst -- the toilet seat in the bathroom was way too small for the toilet (see picture), so needless to say, it was not an enjoyable experience for me to go in to use the toilet after the boys in the family had used it and got the rim of the toilet dirty. The toilet was not even properly attached to the wall so the whole toilet would rock and bang against the wall when someone sat down. \n\nI had a terrible night's sleep because every time someone on the hall closed the door to their hotel room or the executive lounge, the whole wall shook and the sound echoed loudly down the hall. \n\nThe pool was nice for the kids to play in, but the hot tub was broken. \n\nThe wireless internet was so slow (slower than dial-up), it was hardly worth my time to sit there and wait for it to load anything.\n\nThe executive lounge was average, with a nice sitting area and TVs. The food was below average-- lacking in variety, and the service was grouchy. The internet on the computers  was not working the entire time we were there, so no chance to print boarding passes.\n\nThere is nothing within walking distance besides a bunch of other hotels.\n\nWe ate at Rennick's restaurant, with some eager anticipation because we were hungry and the menu looked decent, and it was our only option. We sat outside in the lovely and peaceful courtyard by the fountain. The waitress was very earnest and sweet. I ordered a Tuna MELT with sweet potato fries. Everything on the plate was cold, though the plate was warm. There was a sprinkle of cheese on the top that looked like it was broiled for 20 seconds to brown, but even that was cold. I asked the waitress to have them re-heat the sandwich, and maybe put a little more cheese on the top. She returned with the cold sandwich and cold fries.

Having to (mostly) pay for the food I did not eat, with not even a token attempt from the restaurant to try and fix it or get me something I liked? Total let down.\n\nThe best part of our experience at this hotel was the transportation to/from the airport. Both of the drivers were prompt, courteous and helpful.\n\nI'm sad to report all these issues with this hotel that are clearly inconsistent with the Hilton brand. I was disappointed to say the least, and I hope that Hilton will do something to bring this hotel up to par.",0
"Main Pro: We stayed here for Spring Training, so the location of the hotel was great for visiting different stadiums. \n\nMajor Con: The Internet (both WiFi and Ethernet) was a complete and utter joke. I was forced to pay $10 for 24 hours of access. In addition, the speeds were slower than turtles (think of the commercials). This is an issue that needs to be addressed immediately; I hope the hotel management hears this message loud and clear.",0
"As a Hilton Diamond Member, I have spent my last stay at this hotel. I have trie to stay loyal but I must move on, and I will. Two nights in a row, poor service in the restaurant has forced me to leave and go out to dinner elsewhere last night and I even tried tonight and again after waiting over twenty minute, I came to my room without eating. I left a message for Rosa but to no avail, she never returned my call.\n\nThe safe in the room doesn't work, the dresser has bubbles on the top and the shower leaks consistently.\n\nThere are better places to stay and I will find it, even if I have to choose a Marriott. I am disappointed but you have the right to know.",0
"I don't normally stay near the airport but this time I did. My check in was smooth. My room is really nice. My bed is super comfy. Everything one can expect in a Hilton. \n\nThe only downside, no quality restaurants nearby.  But if you have a rental car, its no big deal.",1
"I consider myself a fair individual and I have since been contacted by the manager of the hotel and the food and beverage manager and am more than satisfied on how they solved my concerns. I am staying here the next time I come to Phoenix and will post after my stay there to let you know how it goes! Right now, feeling good!",1
"I'm going to have to agree with Lauren on this one.\nThis place is a little beat up and completely off the beaten path of any semblance of a night life. You'll need to jump a cab or bribe a shuttle driver to get you to Mill Street or anywhere for that matter. The service was friendly from room service, the restaurant and the front desk but the venue itself was dated. I will say that the pool area was nice and both the pool and the hot tub seemed clean. My room was fairly clean but their wall outlets were limited, the bathroom was cramped and my room and the hallways on the first floor smelled like cigarettes. My bed was pretty comfy thankfully but for some reason it seemed that people were slamming their doors throughout the night all four nights I stayed here. They did have some construction going on early morning but that's a non-issue. Lastly, the in hotel Rimrock restaurant left a lot to be desired so you may want to have a dining plan ready when you hit the tarmac in PHX. The only restaurant in walking distance is a Denny's.",0
"This is a very clean and professional hotel. The location is perfect for layover at the airport. Shuttle service is fast and efficient. Front lobby is awesome the rooms are once again very clean most have balconies. I did not eat at any of the restaurants, but the guest I spoke with said the food was excellent.\n\nJF",1
This Hilton is going threw a renovation. I got to stay in a newly remodeled room. I liked how fresh and modern it was. Our stay was good but not perfect. The bed was comfortable and our room seemed clean. You have a small slim shower and you have to turn the facet counter clock wise for your water. The other thing is that it's hard to get an outlet by your bed incase you need one for something. During our stay NONE of the vending machines had bottled water to purchase and my husband complained at the front desk and then they gave us bottles of water. Had the free breakfast the next day and it was OK. The ride back from the airport was OK. Overall I had a good stay.,1
I want give this 2  stars but gave it 4 so people could see it. I was not told it's under construction! The walls are paper thin.I am  hearing a party upstairs but I cannot call the front desk bc of remodel. They did give us vouchers for breakfast and dinner appetizers. Everything is clean but I can hear everything. They did give us earplugs for construction. So grumpy,1
"It is understandable that this hotel currently under renovation but the place is just uncomfortable. The staff are not so friendly or accomodating to direct or assist guest of there makeshift entrances, waiting are for airport shuttles. The definitely need to put up signage of where things are. Did I mention that the doors here are noisy. When other guests especially those with connecting room closes their door it is so loud will surely wake you up. The doors here also slams if you dont carefully close it. Did the management neglected to pay attention to fix such problem? We were wokenup at 0430 by the next door guest when they left!Ohhh the ice machine was broken on all the floors except for the ground floor. Sadly, we were placed on the 5th floor and my poor husband had to go to all the floors to find this out. No one at the front desk bothered to let us know this. Ohhhh thank goodness we only stayed one night here and did not pay full price. \n\nNo I will not stay here again!",0
"I was in Phoenix on a business trip with 3 fellow workers this is where the company booked us since the Hilton was full. \n\nWell to start, the lobby and restaurant are under construction at this time. I'm sure it would have been alot better once that is completed. I didn' t get the roach roommate the other reviewer had, and would say it was cleaned well enough daily. \n\nThe breakfast is served from 7-10 each morning and is much better than many free ones I have seen. Coffee, juice, milk, fresh fruits, cereals, bagels, breads and toaster to use, oatmeal and one morning even had waffle you could cook. \n\nVery average at this time.",0
"Conveniently located near the airport. Nice lobby...free internet, coffee & prints, friendly staff ...5 stars to Chandler...offered a shuttle ride to downtown Tempe and prompt pick up too.",1
"This is probably the best Courtyard that I've ever stayed at and I've been to quite a few.  This was place was remodeled within the past year or so and they've really taken Courtyard up a level in terms of quality.  Here's the highlights:\n\n* They have finally added a bar to the lobby area as well as a small restaurant that serves some pretty good food.  For people like me who prefer to stay in after a long day working on the road, I was absolutely thrilled that they've made these additions.  You can also take the food / drinks back to the room with you, as I don't believe they have room service yet.\n\n* The lobby area in general is nicely furnished with lots of comfy seats and a few computers with Internet access and printing.\n\n* The courtyard has a nice outdoor pool and a bunch more chairs for hanging out and relaxing.\n\n* The Market is still there with snacks and beverages available 24/7, with beer and wine sold until 4 AM at this location.\n\nMy only complaint about this place was the speed of the wi-fi.  Granted it's free but it was embarrassingly slow.  I couldn't even play a video on YouTube at the lowest quality setting without it constantly having to pause and rebuffer.  I ended up hooking my laptop up to my Droid X smartphone and using it as a modem and speed there was considerably faster.  Hopefully this gets improved sometime soon.",1
You can write the same review about this hotel that you can about any of the refreshed Courtyards. Very good hotel. Close to the airport. Great service.,1
Sweet pool and pretty nice fitness center although it's small. They also have a lot of other quality food and drinks but at a pretty high price however. Nice staff and very clean and well maintained rooms. They have free wifi or you can pay extra for high speed internet. Nice flat screens in the rooms and desk to do work. Also the rooms have balconies with chairs to lounge.,1
"We go to this Papa John's all the time. Service has always been quick and friendly. The one time they messed up the order, I called and they immediately gave a coupon for a free pizza to make it up.\n\nIMHO Papa John's is the best chain pizza out there - much better than Domino's, Pizza Hut, or Little Caesar's (although any pizza is always good).\n\nThe only drawback is that delivery can take up to 45 minutes and since the store is less than 10 minutes from my house, I always do carryout.\n\nBut, if you're in the area and craving pizza, I recommend this Papa John's.",1
Yikes! Cold pizza when I called in the guy on the phone just acted totally confused & as if he was not responsible in the slightest. $50 of gross! Not ordering from this location ever again. Staff is clueless!,0
"I could have sworn I had Rally's before in my lifetime, but after I tried those fries, there is no way that I had it before because I definitely would have remembered it! The fries are THE BEST! The burger wasn't anything special, definitely can settle for burger king since it isn't much of a difference. They really do have a lot to choose from, but I doubt if I'll try, I gag at the thought of a chili cheese burger..*eek* \n\nFurthermore, I will be back for more fries!",1
Cheap sandwiches...not to seem like a snob in writing but the d\u00e9cor and menu say it all. This is one of those places I would eat at if there weren't any other options. The food was very mediocre and I'm not sure I would trust the cold cuts. Sorry Cousins...I enjoy you as much as Port of Subs...which is not much.,0
"I felt lazy to drive to a better place to eat, but since it was next door I came here. The staff isnt the friendlyest and the food reflects it. They are very cheap on the amount of meats they put on the sandwich. You get more at Subway, if you want to compare. Also, for what they charge your better off going to another place. If you want a really good sub sandwich, go to Jimmy Johns. They have much better service, food and always have a friendly greeting when entering or leaving there.",0
Turned into parking lot and there were two ladies on the side of the building smoking. They see me walk in so they come inside. I did not see them wash their hands. Lady who took my order reeked of cigarette smoke.\n\nThe combo meal was close to $9. There was not much meat on the bread. Walking out I felt I had been overcharged for a bad lunch. \n\nBefore I pulled out of the parking lot the two ladies were on the side of the building smoking again. \n\nWill never go to Cousins again. Too many other sub places to choose from. Even if the price for the combo meal was reasonable the woman just reeked badly of smoke. \n\nSpend less time smoking and more time running your business or soon you wont have a business and you will have all day to smoke.,0

"Love the sandwiches, still, and am happy to see a Cousin's is opening in Mesa on Greenfield/I60.  BUT, this location on Washington... it used to be great and when I worked in Tempe, I'd drive all the way to get that great Cousin's bread.  Stopped in the other day, very excited to get a Cousins Sub.  Place was messy, HOT (in February), they were out of all but 2 types of bread and were turning some customers away who didn't want the regular Italian white bread.  They used to be friendly; not so much anymore.  Cousins Subs is still the best and I'll be visiting the new one in Mesa, but I won't visit this location anymore.",0
"Being new to town, I stopped here on my lunch hour.  For one, the parking is awful.  Two, you need binoculars to read their menu.  The print is SO SMALL.  The lady at the counter was very helpful, I must say.  She wasn't impatient, just listed the sandwiches.  I decided on a ham and cheese on multi-grain.  I asked for it to be heated.  Service was fast, and I was out of there in less than 10 minutes, I think.\nNow for the sandwich.  I had to take two bites before I hit the meat, and if I hadn't opened the sandwich, I would have thought they forgot the cheese.  VERY skimpy on the meat and cheese portions.  The bread was okay, but I've had much better at Blimpies and Port-o-Sub.  Not to mention both put a LOT more meat and cheese on their sandwiches.  Not worth the money, not going back.  Sorry, Cousins.",0
"First time at Cousins despite being within one mile for six years. \n\nTried the Chipotle Cheesesteak on jalape\u00f1o cheese bread. It came with thinly sliced beef, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onion, chipotle mayo and hot pepper relish. It arrived on a soft roll, which is always dicey for take-away. \n\nI normally don't get all the healthy stuff (lettuce, toms or onions) but I forgot to ask about it. It was really good!  The beef was tender and juicy, the spices were spot-on and the veggies offered nice contrast. \n\nI would've preferred a bit of up-sell, since I had never been there. The cashier seemed to want to be done with me tho so I just got the sandwich. \n\nI will try it again, possibly with other choices next time.  I recommend the Chipotle Cheesesteak.",1
Love this place for a quick easy lunch. I work in the area and it isn't the best part of town and so I am picky about where I go for lunch. The staff here is friendly and quick. They make a tasty sub.,1
"I have been to this sub shop a few times.  The subs are well below average.  The only reason I go in here is because of it's proximity to my workplace.  However, I have now been in there for the last time.  \nI recently went in and ordered the Philly cheese steak.  When I got the sub and sat down, I looked inside and there was hardly any meat.  I am not usually one to complain.  If I don't like a place I simply won't go back.  My wife was with me and said I should go back and say something.  \nI took it up to the counter, asked them if they could put more steak in the sub.  They said no because the meat is weighed and a sub only gets 3.75 ounces of meat.  I told her to look at my sub as I opened it.  I said my first and last bite will be nothing but bread.  Then she offered to put more meat on the sub even though she is not supposed to.  I said never mind, I'll eat it and just not come back.  At least at subway, for 5 bucks i can walk out of there full.... \nThis place is garbage.",0
"When I moved into Mandarina I really liked it. The staff was cool, my neighbors were nice, the grounds were well-maintained and it is in a good location if you have to commute between Tempe, Scottsdale & Phoenix, which I was doing at the time. \n\nDuring the last couple months of living at Mandarina, they switched management. Really perplexing and annoying events started occurring. For some reason, the time they saw fit to do landscaping-extremely loud landscaping- was starting at 5 AM. And this was in the winter, so no heat excuses. The staff was suddenly never in the office when the hours were posted and took 2 hour lunches. The front security gate broke and \""""two weeks\"""" turned into.. well I don't know because it was still broken when I moved out.\nAt first the new management themselves seemed okay, the woman who was managing seemed  pretty nice and considerate. Then it came time for my roommate and I to move out--breaking the lease because of her upcoming promotion/move to another state. This is when  they showed their other, evil, manipulating, conniving, ruthless side. After completely ripping every last cent they possibly could out of us it got worse. The management company \""""misplaced\"""" our final payments and I didn't find out until 2 months later when I was contacted by a creditor. Lovely. After a week of calls, voicemails, and getting the run around, the apartment fessed up to making a mistake, but we still had to pay interest that had accrued while there was a \""""remaining balance.\"""" We were freaked out about having this on our credit and just wanted to put the whole debacle behind us so we paid it without much fight. \n\nThe facility itself is nice, but I would never recommend it to anyone unless they had a different management team.",0
"\""""it's just past castle boutique but if you reach le girls you've gone too far\""""\n\nhahhahah!\n\n\nI have lived here for almost 3 years and I really like it. I have noticed that the quality of people has gone down a bit and the neighbors are more hillbilly-ish/hoodlum. \n\nI am in the process of buying my first home and hopefully they don't give me any crap when I leave.\n\nI think alicia covered everything pretty perfectly, and i definitely recommend living here. one thing that i will add about hating this place is they come to your apt a couple times a year to check the smoke alarm and filters. I guess that comes with renting? but i don't like people coming into my home when I'm not there. \n\ni posted some pics of the interior on my review of pruitt's furniture- check them out if you'd like to see the inside of the 1b1b :)",1
"Let me just start off saying that I was an original tenant at Mandarina. I moved into my unit in Feb 2002 (the unit had never been occupied) and moved out April 2009 upon buying a house. \n\nI am very picky when it comes to my living quarters, and Mandarina lived up to my expectations throughout the years. I have to say that while every complex/neighborhood is going to have its fair share of problems (crime, aggravating neighbors, etc), at Mandarina, there was rarely an incident. \n\nThree gripes throughout the years: \nParking Accommodations - \nAbout 95% of the parking is covered. If your guest parks in a covered space, they're liable to get towed if the resident arrives home to find their spot is taken. If there are no spots, your guests must find parking elsewhere. Most likely next door at the Draw-10 and walk over. \n\nTrash Pickup - This was both a perk and a pain. The perk was not having to cart your trash all the way to the trash compactor. You instead just left outside of the breezeway every pickup morning. My gripe is at no fault of Mandarina, but the residents who did not abide by the trash service times. \n\nLight rail - No fault of Mandarina. Waiting to get out of the complex to head east on Washington was always a pain after the light rail was completed. \n\nWhile I had no issues with the staff upon moving out, the original staff made it a truly great place to live back in 2002-2004.  Overall, I'd recommend Mandarina to anyone looking for a new apartment complex.",1

"One word -- NIGHTMARE!!!!!!\n\nOf all of the businesses I have ever dealt with this business was by far the worst experience I have ever had -- and I am a business owner myself!!!\n\nLet's start from the top:\n\n1. We (my wife and I) book our fight in January of 2014 to fly from Phoenix, AZ to Page, AZ to go white water rafting down the Grand Canyon with my father in law. For those of you who aren't familiar, those rafting trips have to be booked a year in advance, for private trips often multiple years in advance with a lottery for who can raft it (population caps on the trips).\n\n2. Four Days before the flight Great Lakes tells us that it is now FIRST COME FIRST SERVE ON THE FLIGHT!!!! Wait what? First come first serve seating? NO FIRST COME FIRST SERVE BOARDING!!! If we don't get there before the other passenger's we're screwed, and if we do get there before them they are screwed. \n\n3. We had already booked flights with Southwest so we knew we would only arrive an hour before the other passengers.  Needless to say we did not get there in time to get a seat on the plane. \n\nNEXT you would expect Great Lakes to say \""""oh sorry we couldn't get you a seat, let's get you a refund -- and some compensation for the $400 and 7 hour car ride you are now going to have to spend on a rental. Did we get that? OF COURSE NOT! \n\nDid we even get a refund? NOPE! \n\nLuckily we were able to get our credit card company to reverse the charges otherwise I would have likely called their phone number once a day to tell them to quit their jobs.\n\nLike I said -- NIGHTMARE!!!!!",0
"I was looking to get a transmission fluid change and an engine oil change for my civic. Most of the time I just go to the Honda dealer who charges exorbitant prices. At the last minute I just wanted to see if i can find someone close to where I live. I went on yelp and found this place. I talked to JOHN who gave a fair price for the service. He finished the job like he promised and helped me understand more about what my car needs in terms of service. HE IS AMAZINGLY HONEST AND FAIR WHICH IS SO HARD TO FIND THESE DAYS. Even though the service costed a little more than the quote he gave me, he just wanted me to pay the quoted price on the phone. I paid the actual cost as an appreciation for his effort. I will be moving to a different state soon. but if I were to live here, he has earned a life long customer. GO JOHN!",1
they suck.. dont go there,0
"Awesome, honest guy. Took my car in today because I thought I needed my brake pads replaced. He took a look at them with me there and let me know that it looked like I still had some life in them but he would put the car on the lift to check the brake pads on the inside. He confirmed that I still had a few thousand miles left in them and that it was safe to drive. Never had a mechanic not try to sell me on something. I appreciate him saving me the money for now. I will definitely be going back to him for all future needs. Word of advice, there is no sign out front and it's a one man shop so call first to set an appt if you can.",1
"A BAD  choice for a motel in Phoenix if your plans include sleep.  I blundered into it by reserving on line and trying to save a few bucks- bad mistake.  The place is just north of the west end of the Sky Harbor Airport and about 100 feet from an Amtrak/ freight railroad crossing, in an industrial area.  \nA \""""one-on-one\"""" girlie place is across the street and there is an \""""adult toy store\""""  nearby.  Classy neighborhood.   \nThe roar of the planes and the ringing of the railroad crossing penetrates the rooms like there are no walls and the trains themselves always blow their whistles- about a hundred times- as they approach the crossing - even in the middle of the night.  The freight trains are about a hundred cars long.  There are absolutely no amenities here, but the price is still pretty high- about fifty bucks- You can go to the La Quinta and live in absolute luxury for another twenty bucks- it WILL be worth it.  The bedspreads are so garishly colored with the Motel 6 logo that the decor alone will keep you awake.  Little tiny towels in a little tiny bathroom.  No chairs to sit in to watch TV.  \nThe staff is nice, though and they have free (!) coffee in the office in the morning.  And- they have an all-night security to guard to keep the derelicts from stealing the stuff out of your car.  There is a pool.  Do not go here. Repeat-  DO NOT GO HERE.",0
"Im going to have to agree Whole heartedly. And i informed the manager of it as well. I picked this one because it was close to the Airport and the Light Rail. The noise from the Airport wasnt to bad. But it was the Train Horns all NIGHT LONG and ALL MORNING when your trying to sleep. I wouldnt pick this one, the neighborhood wasnt bad despite what people say. But the Train noise is just unbearable. I got it for the Click 6 rate which was reasonable. Stay Elsewhere. I should of picked one further down that was right off the light rail.",0
"Really funky, nasty and trashy neighborhood this place was in. The clerk behind the booth was behind metal bars as well. I know this is KIND of standard these days but it fit quite well for the neighborhood. \nTo make it all the more worse I am 100% sure that I got scabies(skin lice) off of the sheets. This was the only hotel I stayed at the time. Normally considered a STD! That was a horrible experience! My dogs got it too and had to go to the vet and it took me weeks to get over it and I had to cover myself from the top of my head to the soles of my feet and itch even more because that was a sign that the medicine was working . I had to wash my wardrobe three times to make sure the bugs were dead and constantly had to clean the house and try not to touch a thing while I was getting over it! Ugh!\nNot all Motel 6's are like this but in Phoenix they might be.",0
"Unfortunately my apartment complex caught fire, and I was forced to stay here temporarily.  My daughter, I and two cats came here. I asked for a \""""handicap\"""" room, as my knee had gone out. While the neighborhood isn't the greatest, the train noise can be bothersome.  However, I loved the safety bars installed throughout the bathroom as I had troubles walking. \n\nOverall if I had to do it again, I'd stay at the Scottsdale location.",0
"I've purchased wood here for years, and recommended this business to friends.  But today, I pulled up to purchase a couple bags of wood, and the employee who was supposed to be selling me the wood took a look at my \""""Obama 2012\"""" bumber sticker, took a few steps back, and then said sarcastically \""""well, i GUESS I will still help you, even though you voted for Obama\"""".   Not only was this rude, but none of your business.  You are in the business of selling wood, and I guess also you are in the business of trying to insult your customers.

"Never again. We got wood here for a few years but the last time I parked too close to a truck (maybe 10 feet away) and the owner went nuts and started screaming and yelling.

They lied to us and will never ever use thier serivce.  I have asked to speak with the owner but he is never in the office.",0

"Carolina's is a great lunch spot that is the closest thing Phoenix has to an LA-style tacqueria - hole in the wall location, minimal decor, iffy neighborhood and great Mexican food.  Pretty much everything I've had there is great, though a friend of mine swears by their enchiladas.  \n\nIt gets packed around noon and stays that way until 1:15 or so and my favorite time to go there is around 2 to cram my face until 3 and pass out at my desk until 6.",1
"No one who's eaten this food with me has ever been inside the restaurant.  No, I'm not pawning it off as my own.  I just know that some folks are willing to eat quite a bit of food that they might not eat if they saw where it was from.  Now that they are converts - I am tempted to take someone with me next time I grab their food - or maybe send them alone.  But I don't want to ruin a good thing. \n\nFor the price of this food, you could get Taco Bell.  But if you can get Carolina's, why would you ever get Taco Bell?  I've always grabbed it on the way home from work - so around 6ish.  I have to say, besides the fact that it's in an older neighborhood, I've never seen any of the other things that seem to scare some of the other reviewers.  Maybe I'm just lucky.  Who knows.  \n\nAll the food is so good I don't even know where to begin on what to suggest.  Something with a tortilla.  They are just that good.  Or - get whatever else you want and buy some extra tortillas to go.  Eat one on the way home like McDonald's Fries.  And just like Fries, they are SO much better when they are still warm.  \n\n5 stars for food, but losing some for parking and then their limited and spotty seating in the restaurant.  Wish I could go 4 1/2.\n\nSpecial note - They have some of the best Christmas Tamales in Phoenix.  But don't think you can just walk in and get them.  I'm not sure how soon the waiting list goes up, but you'll want to get on that list ASAP.  They sell out quite quickly.",1
"Carolina's is simply great. They have Jamaica flavored drink in the fountain dispenser (it's red, it's tangy and it's delish), the creamiest refried beans you've ever experienced (lard-a-rific), hot ginormous fresh flour tortillas that melt in your mouth, chorizo that makes me buy it on impulse and freeze it for Carolina-free Sundays or long trips, and hot sauce so good it makes me crave it fortnightly. Oh, and if you've had a variation of the rolled tacos (flautas) at any of the local \""""-betos\"""" in the Valley, you must try the Carolina's version...you'll never go back. But, my favorite thing on the menu is the astounding bean, potato and cheese burrito. The very definition of perfection.\n\nSure, it's in South Phoenix down the street from where one of my childhood friends grew up (and the original Food City), sure it's always crazy busy so you sometimes have to park up the street and wait in a line that extends the end of the restaurant. (Uh, Saturdays and anytime around lunch time during the week are especially busy.) But, I'm sorry, in my opinion you haven't eaten Mexican food in Phoenix unless you've come here.",1
"Yummy, yummy, yummy!  My family and I have been eating at Carolina's for about 12 years now.  It is truly delicious mexican food.  They have the best beans, tortillas and enchilada sauce in town!  I cannot get enough of their food.  My favorite meal is a bean & cheese burrito enchilda style with a butter tortilla on the side.  Try it, I promise you will thank me.  \n\nThis place is streaming with professional business people, police officers, firemen, construction workers and everyone in between.  The line is sometimes out the door on weekday lunch hour.  It is actually better to pre-call your order in, although the pick-up line can also pretty long at the lunch hour.  \n\nThe only reason I am giving the restaurant 4 stars is due to the location and building's interior/exterior.  It is in a pretty poor neighborhood in a crumbling building.  But hey...maybe that add's to the authentic appeal?  Another Carolina's recently opened up on Cactus & Cave Creek, same food but much nicer location.  \n\nAs an addendum to this review the food is definitely 5 stars - it is that good!  Try it!",1
"Great tortillas and tamales served with sticky floors, scary bathrooms and regularly overflowing waste cans hurts Carolina's reputation. If they could hose the place down once in awhile, it would definately get more stars from me.",0
The best Mexican food!  The chicken and cheese burrito is the best on the menu!  But I would suggest to do take-out because the place is not that nice to stay at.,1
I'm normally one to shy away from restaurants that appear (inside and out) as if they're going to give me the worst case of E. Coli/Salmonella/Asbestos/Gun-shot wounds I've ever had.\n\nBut I just don't care when it comes to Carolinas!  Having worked at Sky Harbor for few years I ate here too often to count and never had a bad experience.\n\nJust don't look too closely at your surroundings when you're picking up your grub!,1
"Raise your hand if you like authentic Mexican food....if you do, this is the spot. This place isn't much on the eyes, but your taste buds will probably spontaneously combust with enjoyment. \nIf you're going durring lunch hours prepair to stand in line, and it'll probably be out the door. Apparently more, and more people are finding out about it. Dispite the line, it moves relatively fast. You can also call in your order before you get there too. Mine is speed dial 5 with the brail on it in case I go blind one day. \nWhile you're there, try a butter tortilla...Carolina's make they're own tortillas fresh.",1
"Well everyone here is gai for Carolina's, so am I and I am thrilled that they opened a 2nd restaurant in my neck of the woods (Cave Creek and Cactus) because I don't go down by the airport that much.\n\nAs others have stated, however, the original location has a lot of, shall we say, local color. A little too much for me. I felt like I was eating at a prison cafeteria; hell, a prison cafeteria probably has more ambience and is cleaner.\n\nOn the few occasions I find myself going that way, I do take-out. I regularly buy tortillas by the dozen from them, they beat the hell out of supermarket-bought tortillas. The Cave Creek/Cactus location is a lot cleaner and in a much safer part of town, I have no problem eating in at that location.",1
"Best damn chorizo, egg and potato burrito I've ever had.  Next to my grandmother's of course.",1
"I can't possibly say anything that hasn't been said about this place.  Amazing salsa.  Lovely smell.  Chewy, gooey tortillas that they make in the back and you can see them do it.  Whenever I finish eating food from Carolina's, I cry a little... gentle, muffled sobs.\n\nThey provided the food for an event that I had at work.  Luckily, some of my clients don't like tamales or delicious little burros, so when they left, I ate more than I should have.  Their pansiness is my benefit.\n\nIf I could, I would make sweet, sweet love to Carolina.",1
"Had Carolina's for lunch yesterday.  Just happened to be downtown with some clients I am consulting for.  Got the beef enchilada combo.  The food was great as always.  I usually go for the burros, although I rarely get through a foot long (who could?).\n\nMy colleagues got cheese enchiladas and chicken tacos.  Everyone was very happy with the food, and we all left stuffed.  They even paid!  The only thing better then lunch at Carolina's is a free lunch at Carolina's.",1
Now that I work so close to Carolina's.... I have been back 3 times within 2 1/2+ weeks!!  :)  Ah that red chile (add cheese) burrito and a taco duro!  YUM!  Make sure you get some tortilla's to go!,1
"I cannot say enough about Carolina's. By far the best Mexican joint in town. It's nothing to write home about in terms of atmosphere, but that's part of the experience.\n\nMy favorite foods:\n- Any burrito, enchilada style with red sauce. Like everyone says, the tortillas are absolutely the best anywhere and that red sauce cannot be beat.\n- Chorizo anything.\n- The chips and salsa. I always buy an extra bag of chips to take home and the salsa is phenomenal.\n- Chocolate chimichangas. Small but oh so good.\n\nTry this one or their location in North Phoenix. You will be beyond impressed.",1
"I eat here fairly regularly and have been doing so for years. It is not really what I would call pure authentic, but it is very good. I usually order the number 13 combo with taco, tostada, and a beef enchilada. The choriso breakfast burritos are really good also. This place is always very busy for lunch but we generally manage to get a table by the time our order is ready. If your going to do takeout call in your order so it will be ready when you get there.\nThis is THE place to go buy freshly made flour tortillas, you order them, they make them, and you get them nice and warm.",1
"Best Mexican food in the valley for the money!  Location is in a not so good part of town but a lot of local police and fireman eat there during lunch time during the week.  The tortillas are made fresh and you end up wanted to take some home with you.  The red chili burro is very good and the rice and beans is so fresh it makes your mouth water thinking about it!  There is a line during the week so be prepared but the food is ready in no time.  Staff is very nice and friendly, food is hot and fresh, not too bad!",1
"Why all the hype? I am still pondering why people rave about this place after having lunch there last week.. The location is not in the best part of town, the dining area is pretty dirty (see attached pictures) and the service sucked.\n\nWe ordered a beef chimichanga, which they left in the fryer too long so it came out almost burnt and it was tiny (like 4 bites and you're done tiny).\nA bean and cheese burrito (good, but nothing spectacular) and a chorizo tostada, I will say the chorizo was excellent and I am glad because I had to fight for it. \n\nThe place was packed when we arrived so it took us about 40 minutes to order and get our food. They call out numbers for you to pick up your order so there is this constant drone of number calling and the speaker was really loud, it was pretty annoying. \n\n\nTo pick up your food you give them your receipt with your number on it. They gave me a bean tostada instead of a chorizo and when I took it back the guy asked me for my number to prove I ordered it.. This was the same guy I gave the ticket to when I picked it up originally. I told him this and he sighed heavily and started picking though all the receipts in the stack... A few minutes later he locates it, rolls his eyes and hands me a new tostada..\n\nThe food was average and the service sub par. I won't be returning... And there are Panderias on every corner so being able to buy home made tortillas really didn't impress me that much..",0
It is what it is - very good fast food Mexican restaurant in South Phoenix.,1
"Carolina's is Mexico's preemptive answer to Americans who think Taco Bell is authentic Mexican food. It's tasty food served up with a side of beans in a building that under other circumstances would be better suited to an auto mechanic. But therein lies the charm. Carolina's seems to consciously embrace chaos by not having queues for customers to maintain an appropriate line and a menu that has seen better days (not to mention, some of the missing prices cause some confusion). It habitates in South Phoenix like a buoy in a hurricane, yet it fits and belongs and to perfectly complement the gritty reputation of its surroundings. \n\nWhen I used to work at 48th Street and Southern Ave, I would stop by here after calling in my order and treat my coworkers to the most amazing breakfast burritos this side of the border.",1
"carolinas, your enchiladas ruined it for me.\n\ni can't imagine eating another one of your soggy tortillas swamped in a pool of the most horrifying enchilada sauce my taste buds have ever met. mole overload and non-existent chile. lacking any real taste to it whatsoever.\n\ndisappointed.",0
"Authentic Mexican food in an authentic Mexican barrio.  Yes, it's 'dirty' (although it has yet to fail a health inspection), and yes, it's not in a gentrified neighborhood where every building looks the same,  but it is some of the best 'home-cooked' Mexican you'll get this side of the border.  Personal favorites include the machaca, chorizo, and of course the tortillas.\n\nSo if you want great street style Mexican food, this is the place for you,  but if you're uptight drone  who value style over substance stick to the tex-mex joints in your generic suburban strip malls.\n\nRemember to pick up a dozen or so of  their home made tortillas you take with you.  I wouldn't be surprised if they are amongst the best tortillas in the world!",1
"I noticed just today that I still haven't handed out the coveted fiver to any Mexican restaurants yet, which is probably because I've only been rating places in Dallas.  For Mexican at its finest Phoenix is my city of choice.  And in this fine city is Carolina's, the epitome of everything a Mexican place should be, the gold standard for Mexican food if you will.  Here's why ...\n\n1) Cheap - Carolina's does to money what Jesus did to bread and fishes.  Find some change in your car or couch and you can feed a full family.  \n\n2) Delicious - Pick anything that rhymes with maraca (i.e. Machaca Burro or the Oxaca Special, my two faves) and get ready for it to blow you freaking mind!  Oh, and how could I forget ... The buttered tortilla is a piece of heaven, especially once you get to the middle.  My wife once made the mistake of having me hold her tortilla while she went to the bathroom, and after several minutes I just couldn't help myself and ate the butteriest middle bite.  She still to this day has not forgiven me for that.\n\n3) Ghetto - Every time I come here I'm worried the roof is going to collapse.  There's no back on my chair that's been bolted into the floor.  I would not come here at night for fear of getting my burro stolen, among other things.  All this adds to the experience.\n\nThis place is as good an excuse as any to plan a trip to Phoenix.  If I lived here Carolina's would be the sole reason for me weighing 300 pounds, it is literally that amazing.",1
"This place does have great food and totally lives up to it's reputation.  I just wish the location wasn't in the middle of the ghetto.  I'd only recommend getting take out, but if you'd like to experience the area by all means dine in and get the true experience.  The food is great hands down and the prices are almost the same in Mexico getting street tacos.  \nI'd really like to check out the other restaurants Carolina's has in the Phoenix metro to see if they live up to the orginal shack.  If they are even as close as good I'd be outrageously thrilled.",1
"Decent food for decent prices. Not much in the way of decor (cement floors/ cafeteria style booth tables) but who cares? The green chili is delicious, the tortillas are always soft and warm, and although the place is more often than not packed, they pump the food out fast. Yummy.",1
"I lived in the Phoenix area for nearly 4 years, but now I am back home in Boston.  People usually ask me if I miss Phoenix, and the truth is that I don't.  However, one thing about Phoenix that I do miss is the real MEXICAN FOOD.  I only ate at Carolina's once, but I still remember it being some of the best Mexican food I have ever had.  Make sure you get here early for lunch because this place gets packed!",1
"I have to say, as a native Mexican and as an avid conoisseur of REAL Mexican food, Carolina's comes extremely close to the real thing. Unfortunately they are not quite there yet, but they are cutting it close. Their Breakfast menu definitely has to be the best around town when it comes to bombastic Chorizo Egg and Potatoes (Papas as we say in spanish) burritos, but any Chorizo burrito here is guaranteed to make your mouth water. Or as I like to say, it will feel like an orgy in your mouth!",1
"Aw Aw Aw AWESOME (sorry for the stutter...but it was hard for me to express how much I love Carolina's.) \n\nGrowing up in a border town, I love my Mexican food.  This also makes me ultra critical of Mexican restaurants.....but I have nothing critical to say (which is strange coming from someone who has the tag line \""""always the critic.\"""")\n\nThe food is super authentic.  The price is great.  The facility is a total DIVE which makes me love it that much more.  The kitchen is wide open so you can watch the ARMY of staff making tortillas, prepping the food, and packing it for your tasty delight. \n\n You gotta try this place!\n\nPS - pick up a pack of piping hot tortillas to take home.  They are the size of a manhole cover.",1
"Four stars for this wonderful little hole in the wall kind of place.  The location is a little out of the way and I came in for lunch which is okay as there is a very varied crowd.  From longsleeved office workers to utility company uniformed types to gold chained and tatooed tough looking chaps, this place has it all.  Fret not because everyone's here for the good food :). \n\nI had a machaca plate and I like it very much.  The beef was nicely cooked, juicy and tender and full of juices.  The tortillas are home made and very elastic.  Yes elastic, cause u can pull on it and it will stretch, it's almost a little rubber band like.  Unlike most tortillas at other places that simply tears off and crumb when u pull on them, this one will flex with your pull :)\n\nI will be back for sure, can't wait to try their green chili burro :)",1
"Make sure you pull into this place caddy corner with a hunger for some real Mexican.  For real caddy corner, although illegal, use the pedestrian ramp  on the NW corner to launch into the parking lot.  Works best for leaving, when the place is packed. This place has some of the best tortillas, frijoles, chorizo and quesedillas in town.  The other Mexican joints are trying to do what Carolina's has been doing for years....  The only con is they aren't open on Sundays and that they could call in the amigos to renovate the place a bit....",1
"Had a few people my roomie works with reccomend this place since we celebrate burrito Tuesday every week. We were both appalled by the taste and setup. The best explanation we could come up with was a Goodwill version of Taco Bell. Obviously a lot of people really enjoy it, but it is definitely one Mexican restaurant we will never think about eating at again. If there's a Cafe Rumba or Revo burrito in your area, hit either of those instead. They will knock your socks off!",0
Best of PHX.  Authentic food in a neighborhood with no pretension.  Treat yourself.,1
This place has some of the best chimichangas in Arizona.\n\nI love how crappy the building is because it makes the food so much better. I think pretty much everyone I have ever taken to this place got nervous about what was about to happen at first glimpse of the building.\n\nAll have left happy to know the place existed and instant fans of the food.,1
Got the green chile burrito. I don't love refried beans. This is loaded with them. Still good tho. All diff cultures here. That's cool.,1
"I grew up in Tucson, and this place rivals Mi Nidito in quality. Who cares if the building's a little run down? Architecture has nothing to do with flavor. \nI would have my wedding catered by Carolina's, if ever that day may come!!",1
"I sometimes convince myself that there are better Mexican restaurants in Phoenix, then I come here and the illusion is definately shattered. \n\nExcept for the original Garcia's Las Avenidas's rice- Carolina's has the best of everything they do. \n\nI thought for a moment that the restauraunt Rito's had better tortillas, but then I bought a dozen. No way. My mom makes really good tortillas, but they are tied with Carolina's.\n\nI've had the following:\nMachaca- Melt in your mouth soft- perfect flavor, quality beef\nBeans- Perfect\nRice - Very Good\nGreen Corn Tamale- My mouth just seriously watered thinking about it\nChicken Taco- Oh My\nBeef Taco - Oh Oh My\nChorizo Con Huevos- Dang- Good\nCheese Tortilla - Dios Mio!\nTortillas- Every meal on earth should be eaten with Carolina's tortillas- no more forks, no more knives, just tortillas.\n\nOne thing- The Oaxaca burrito isn't good. It's the one thing I've even had from here that didn't knock me out.",1
"BEST TORTILLAS! PERIOD!\nWhat an interesting place. I was amazed to see two hummers, a porsche, two beemers and a handful of trucks at \""""7: 30  AM\""""\nBreakfast burritos (Machaca+eggs) were so good, I drove back from Scottsdale for breakfast. This place is unbelievable. I highly reccommend a visit and buying a few dozons of tortillas (they freeze well, but separating the tortillas with a layer of plastic wrap will make your life very easy).\nIf you have \""""done\"""" Carolina's - SHOUT OUT!",1
"Sometimes I wonder how I have never heard of a place, I have lived in the area for almost 4 years now, and I have never heard of Carolina's. But alas, I finally found my new favorite I can practically walk there place!\n\nI am totally impressed with the quality of the Chorizo and tortillas. And to combine them with some eggs...heaven! They \""""home make\"""" their own chorizo and tortillas, and the quality out of this world!\n\nTheir Chimi's are really good too! \n\nIf you are ever in the area, don't let the outside of the building scary you away, you will love their food!",1
"Yes, I am a fan of this place, always crowded for the lunch rush but your numnber gets called quickly.  Im going with the 3 beef enchiladas today, after I ordered someone walked by with the green and red chile, I am getting that next time!",1
"Great Mexican food. They make their own fresh tortillas that they then package and sell (same with tortilla chips). My company gets them to cater our lunches sometimes and it is one of the more popular catered lunches. \n\nA lot of the other reviews are spot on, and I really don't have that much to add. If you have not tried this place yet, you're in for a treat. Try it out for great Mexican food that won't make you feel like you regret it later!",1
Good and quick. About what you would expect from a local mex place.,1
"It's OK.  \n\nI hate to always be bitching about Mexican food in the Valley, but what can you do?  It's a disgrace.  The fact that this place appears to be some kind of Holy Grail of Mexican food here in Phoenix just seems to emphasize that point.\n\nLet's deal with the food first.  This isn't really Mexican food. It's Tex-Mex food.  That means you've got your choice of tacos, burritos, tostadas, enchiladas, chimichangas, etc.  \n\nWe tried the \""""Oaxaca\"""" burro (massive air quotes around the \""""Oaxaca\"""" part of the name), which was just fine, but very, very small.  I mean seriously, i'ts beans, cheese, potatoes and a bit of chorizo - we're not talking ahi tuna here.  Why not give a normal sized portion?\n\nWe tried the menudo which was delicious but again, a miniscule portion. And they can't even be bothered to give you a plastic bowl, so you have to eat it out of the styrofoam to go container.  I mean, for F's sake, they give me a plastic bowl at my favorite taco truck.  \n\nStill hungry, we ordered a combination plate, which was the same sort of tex-mex crap that you can get pretty much anywhere in town.  Not so great.\n\nIt was all fine for what it is (I guess) but nothing that I would particularly go out of my way for, with the exception of the homemade flour tortillas, which were awesome.  I even bought some to go.  And that's about it for the food.\n\nNow as to the restaurant itself, it's actually pretty disgusting, to the point where one has to conclude that they are just showing contempt for the customers.  The place is filthy.  The bathrooms, in particular, are vile. As Tony Bourdain says, \""""I may not be able to look in the kitchen but I can check out the bathroom and that let's me know how much they care about the restaurant.\"""" Uh, exactly!   And the answer in Carolina's would seem to be, \""""not very much.\""""  The surly and uninterested staff add to that special ambiance. \n\nWe eat in lots of small ethnic restaurants and just because a place is \""""in the hood\"""" doesn't mean it has to be gross.  Our favorite Salvadorean restaurant is in the hood but it's also hospital clean, which makes me pretty confident that the kitchen is also clean. \n\nFinally, the neighborhood.  LOL.  To describe this street as \""""in the hood\"""" is an insult to \""""hoods\"""" everywhere.  This street is one of the most blighted streets I've ever been on, anywhere.  I'm actually thinking of going back there today to do some documentary photos to send to my friends in Cambodia whose visions of America are mostly derived from CSI Miami.  Seriously, it's appalling.  The main thing I was thinking about driving away from there is that the Phoenix city government needs some kind of federal intervention.\n\nSo would I eat there again?  Yeah, probably, if I was in the neighborhood.  Would I go out of my way to drive there?  No way.",0
"i was excited about trying Carolina's as the reviews were great but I have to say I was really disappointed.  First, it is not a restaurant per se but a fast food place where one orders from the counter.  Oh well, that is OK if the food is good but the menu was much like a Taco Bell with very little variation (tacos, burritos, chimichangas, etc.).  I ordered the beef enchiladas but to begin with I was really put off by all the styrofoam, everything was on styrofoam, the drinks, and the meal even if you were eating inside and then plastic forks.  No chips and salsa to start with just styrofoam!!  Then I had to take it back as they gave me chicken enchiladas even though it was marked correctly.  With that, I was looking forward to the meal but it was just 'blah', it was OK, nothing was wrong with it just not very flavorful (maybe it was the styrofoam! JK).  On the pro side, they were busy but got the order out quickly and they were nice enough.  However, if you are looking for a 'restaurant', this is not it, and you can pick up something on your lunch hour quickly and take it wherever but certainly not a dining experience so go with that in mind but there are too many good flavorful Mexican restaurants to go to than to hit Carolina's except for quickness and grab and go.",0
"The Carolina's in Peoria, AZ is run by anti-white Mexican American gang bangers. They sneer at you when you walk up to the counter to place your order. \nDon't get me wrong, the food is excellent. The counter service is terrible and there must be half a dozen vatos standing around doing absolutely nothing.\nThe management at the original Phoenix location needs to take a drive out to Peoria and see just why customers are not returning here.",0
4 stars only because of the flies :/ but other than that they get 5 for the food mmm we love Mexican food being from Los Angeles it's hard to find good Mex food like home it's on every corner so when we traveled to Phoenix about 3 yrs ago we came across this place wow I'm so glad we did it is deliciousssss and homemade tortillas is always a plus so now I get a chance to yelp about it;) so were in town can't wait to hit this place again\n in a lil bit lol,1
I don't understand what is so great about this place. I got the tacos and it was one of the worst that I ever had. I just moved here and still searching for a great taco place.,0
"If you want Mexican food that tastes like it was bought off of a street vendor in Piedras Negras, then this is your place. \n\nI give this place one star for being a step above cat food. Awful, awful, awful!!!",0
"I have a very hard time believeing this place warrants all of the high praise.  Maby the dining in experience is better.  My review is based on a catering order of breakfast burritos that my company did.  The burritos were poorly labled and was difficult to tell which ones did not have nasty chorizo in them.  The burrito I had a bite of and spat out was a salty, greasy mess.  Of course I picked a burrito with chorizo.  So glad I did not waste any calories on this.",0
"Good sign when the crowd includes policemen, firemen, business and more importantly locals.  Another good sign when my 3 and 4 year old make me wait in line not one extra time but two times so that they could get thirds.",1
"1 - There were bars on the windows\n2 - The inside smelled like urine\n3 - A homeless guy came in and tried to steal my food\n\nI can get past the ambiance, a lot of hole in the wall places actually have good food. I ordered the beef enchilada platter. I am about 85% certain the meat was not beef but rather dog or possibly a horse. Instead of red or green sauce they used some kind of brown gravy. The rice and beans were just a step below what you would find in a tv dinner.",0
"This is how Mexican food should be served:\n\nIt should cost about five bucks. \n\nYou start with some form of tortilla, add refried beans, spanish rice, salsa, and lettuce, insert cheesey-messy-possibly-meaty-goodness and throw it all in a styrofoam container. \n\nThen, you ravage the contents of the container until there are fork scratch marks in the styrofoam. \n\nThank you, Carolina's, for being one of the few, the brave, and the proud Mexican places to carry out this process with charm and elegance.",1
"I succumbed to peer pressure!\n\nDon't you hate it when you don't trust your own instincts?  OK, so Yelp is a great resource and so are friends' recommendations.  But when it comes right down to it, it's all a matter of opinion.  When it comes to Carolina's Mexican Food, mine differs from most.\n\nI've mentioned in other reviews that I love the idea of a mom-n-pop place where local owners are doing their own thing, contributing to the local economy with jobs and paying their taxes.  Plus, this place makes their own tortilla shells. so that's a nice touch.\n\nThe food isn't especially memorable.  The machaca or chicken tacos are appropriately sized overall, but contain mostly just iceburg.  See for yourself with the posted pics.  The chicken was flavorless, but the machaca was a bit easier to discern.  Also, the size of the cheese quesadilla was fine, though proportionately had little cheese.\n\nIn the interest of safety, I would NOT recommend coming here at night alone.  If you must, be sure you're with a group of people and at least one or two of you have sobered after a night of drinking.  This place is OK for taking care of the munchies.  Just be sure you're careful to be safe in this less-than-stellar neighborhood.",0
"Great authentic Mexican food. It was very hole in the wall and place and looked dirty but the food was great!! The tortillas were the best I've ever had at a restaurant. It wasn't located in the best of locations, but next time I'm in Phoenix I'll be sure to stop by.",1
"Had some tamales, and they were one of the worst I have ever had! There is no way this place is the best in town? Now I am not condemning this place, I will come back and give them another try. I will try something different and maybe I might change my mind. But I just don't get the hype!",0
Looks suspect however had good reviews so we are checking it out... Food was subpar there is a reason why the food is cheap....,0
"Confession: I went to Carolinas at 9 am this morning for a tostada. I say it was a good breakfast. Also, in the early morning the restaurant is actually quiet! It's almost nice. Anyways, I'm glad they are open earlier, but I still haven't tried any breakfast options there.\n\nCarolinas is not pretty. It was a chinese restaurant, which become clear as soon as you walk in the door and see the crazy colors and zodiac symbols. The kitchen is wide open and it's always packed with people, so it is very very noisy! \n\nHowever, if you are willing to brave the atmosphere, the food is darn good. I like the beans more than any of the meat products, so I stick to burritos and tostadas normally, but every once in a while a chimichanga is worth a try.",1
This place is probably the best Mexican food I have ever had! The tortillas are home- made and sooooo good. I usually get a plain bean and chesse burrito and it never gets old.,1
"I've lived in Phoenix since 1998 and have heard wonderful things about Carolina's since then, and until today, I had never been.\n\nMy fiance and I stopped in today for a late lunch (around 2:30pm) and are so happy we did.  The place wasn't packed but it was busier than we expected.  We checked out the menu, made our selections, and ordered; he got the beef enchiladas and I got the flautas with beans & rice, plus a tortilla since they have such a reputation.\n\nWe only had to wait a few minutes before our food was ready.  IT didn't disappoint!  The flautas were crispy, the shredded beef was flavorful, and the sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese were just right.  The rice was really good, but I think I'll skip the beans next time.  My fiance's beef enchiladas were good and he finished them all.\n\nThe best part, though, was the tortilla.  Amazing.  Before we left, I picked up a dozen to enjoy later. Oh yeah, baby.",1
"I never actually went into the restaurant. \nMy friend, who's been telling me about Carolina's for years, brought over some take-out the other day.\n\nPrefacing our wolfing session, he informed me the meal might not be the greatest, but how the tortillas were the absolute bomb.\nHe said they were the best in the valley, and how when he was in line to pickup the order, several people were there for only tortillas.\n\nEverything he said was accurate.\nMy red chile was ok, nothing special. Refried beans, above average. \nThe tortillas?\n\nUnbelievable.\nGrowing up in south Phoenix, and having a plethora of Hispanic friends whose mom's all made homemade tortillas, Carolina's took me back to those happy days when mom sent me out into the hood looking for my father every weekend.\n\nI almost always found him at the Granillo residence, slurping menudo, drinking beer and eating Mrs Granillo's tortillas, which were the best in the hood.\nCarolinas reminded me of Mrs Granillo, my dad, and my mother yelling at him for coming home drunk. That is until he whipped out some of Mrs Granillo's tortillas, then she lost her mind and all was forgiven.\n\nIf you go to Carolinas, order a dozen flour tortillas, and eat one or two.\nThen go out clubbing and get sloppy drunk.\nWhen your wife presses for where you've been all night, whip out the tortillas.\nThey'll save your bacon.\nI know this first-hand.",1
TOR.TI.LLAS......Delicioso :)!! Andale mi amgos.....,1
"I will keep this simple, the food is good and the price is right.\nI eat here to often and have probably shortened my life expectancy (it isn't the healthiest choice in town)",1
"This place is overrated. My taco shell was so greasy, I ordered a taco salad with shredded beef and got big giant hunks of beef. One time was enough for me, won't be back",0
I always say you cant judge spanish food by a bean and cheese burrito but man their footlong bean and cheese is da bomb!,1
"I don't get it!\n\nI've heard a lot of about this place so I had to try.  At first glance this place gave you one of those uh-huh moments.  Yep, sketchy and a little ghetto I thought.  However, I risked my life for a burrito before!  I ordered the taco platter and my sister had the enchiladas.  I had to get some hot sauce out of the ketchup dispenser, which didn't look too clean, but I took my chances.  I would like to stress \""""hot\"""" since it seemed like it was just \""""sauce\"""".  I can't say too much about the taco since it felt like sustenance.  My sister's enchiladas weren't too bad.  Coming from the barrios of LA I definitely had better Mexican food.  \n\nThe place itself is pretty simple. Basic tables and chairs nothing to wow and pop anybody, but I gather they weren't trying to.  Needless to say I've had better.... much better and I don't think I want to risk my life for this.  -  Enjoy!",0
"OMG!  I could drink the enchilada sauce and live on the tortillas!  BEST MEXICAN RESTAURANT.  Coke AND Pepsi! Genuine.  It's the first place I took my daughter when she returned from France.  Nothing says \""""Welcome to Arizona\"""" like Carolina's!",1
"Took the drive out to Phoenix hoping I'd finally find some great Mexican food. Unfortunately I was disappointed. I ordered a chorizo, egg, potato & bean Burrito. I gave that a 6/10. What killed it for me was the cleanliness of the restaurant. Dirty tables, salsa spilled on the floor & tables. Plus they said they had horchata...it was one of those OLE fountain drinks. I was shocked. Seriously if you can't make your own agua frescas, I can't trust you to make me Mexican food. I lived in California for 24years, 15min away from Mexicali, Mexico. I know Mexican food & this ain't it for me.",0
"menudo. \n\ndon't be scared. do it. \nyou'll thank me later.\n\nps, make sure you fill up your pint or half pint with all those fresh toppings they have out. don't miss out. do it. saturday mornings.",1
"After decades of hearing about Carolina's we stopped by. I don't understand what the fuss is all about. If I was in the neighborhood and wanted some Mexican food I would stop in. But it is not worth any kind of drive. There are a hundred Mexican joints in the valley as good or better. I had the flauta special. Nothing special there. Three run of the mill flautas, a quarter cup of beans and a quarter cup of rice. The beans were ok the rice was not worth putting in your mouth. Plus you get to eat off of styrofoam to go boxes. The bean and cheese burro was run of the mill fast food Mexican. The only good thing I can say is the tortillas were above average. We bought a dozen to take home.",0
Best Mexican joint in Arizona! Red Chili is the greatest!,1
"I'm so sad writing this review because I had such high expectations. I blame my husband for talking up the place so much.\n\nTotally overrated. Don't get me wrong, I'll eat anything, anywhere if it's good, so the totally sketched out location, and dive-y no frills decor (decor is the wrong word, there is no decor) didn't bother me. But I have to say, I've had vastly better Mexican food. We got the machaca hard tacos and the machaca was so bland. The chicken soft tacos were ok. The cheese enchilada was awful. The killer for me was the tortillas used in our dishes weren't fresh. Also, they ran out of tortillas which I wanted to purchase and I was bummed about that.\n\nMy husband, who used to work in the area and frequented Carolinas says that this experience was a fluke, perhaps because we were there fairly close to closing time (although I don't think that's a valid excuse).\n\nI wasn't impressed. Hubby wants me to return for breakfast with him and give this place another shot. Eh, I won't go out of my way to come back but if I'm in the area (unlikely) I guess I'd be willing to give it another try :/",0
Taco's and a 3-way does it for me!,1
"Whenever I am home visiting family in Phoenix I make sure to stop at Carolina's.  This is definitely my favorite place for Mexican food in Phoenix.  Its appearance may scare a first-timer...it is in a rough neighborhood and the building looks like it's on its last leg, but don't be fooled!  It has been my experience that the rougher a place looks, the tastier the food is.  \n\nWe recently brought 3 dozen tortillas back with us to MA to eat and share with friends.  Everyone was impressed.  I usually order the taco & enchilada combo plate, which is absolutely delish.  If you get nothing else, be sure you get a buttered tortilla!",1
After reading the reviews I was really disappointed with this restaurant. The soft tacos were greasy and the hard shell tacos were nasty. Will not visit again.,0
Phoenix is home to some good and cheap Mexican food. Carolina's is one of those places. I don't really come here for the tacos or burritos though. I come here for the godlike tortillas. That is the real draw of this place. I just flew back to Seattle with two dozen in my carry-on. They're seriously the size of your head.,1
"I was sooooo excited about trying the famous Carolinas that I hear everyone speak about. I was ok that it was a run down looking place, was even willing to go in 115 weather knowing they only had swamp coolers, this is how bad I wanted to try it. I ordered the red chile and bean burrito. The red chile had no flavor and was not even a touch of spice. Either they forgot to put beans in my burrito or they put a very small amount. I was dissapointed in this burrito. I also ordered a dozen tortillas, heard these are sooooo good.  These were good and a huge size. I wouldnt go out of my way for these. I know plenty of other mexican bakeries that make good tortillas. I may try this place agian if someone I know really wants to go, but i will not go out of my way and this is not a place I reccomend as good mexican food. I think alot of the good reviews were people who think taco bell is mexican food. Sadly dissapointed :(",0
The food here is AMAZING!!!  I don't know what else to say.  This place doesn't have 4 stars and almost 250 reviews for no reason. Carolina's has been around forever and there's a reason for it. It's the best.,1
"The food here is 5 stars. It is my favorite place to go for Mexican food. My favorite item on the menu is a #9, two tacos with beans and rice. All of the menu items are very reasonably priced and relative to the portion sizes.\n\nThe only downside of this location is the decor. It is clearly a successful restaurant and they should invest in some better seating. It looks rather trashy on the inside, but then again, maybe that is part of its charm.",1
"May look like a dump I a bad neighborhood, but this place is always packed at lunch. Hands down, my favorite Mexican joint north of the border",1
"I've had better... waaaay better.\nFirst of all, I am not scared off by the way the place looks, at all, yes, it might not be located in one of the most affluent or desirable of neighborhoods, but that doesn't present a problem for me. If there is good food, it doesn't matter.\nSecond of all, the tortillas ARE very good, no doubt about it, but that might be the ONLY good thing we got out of our visit to that place. Me and my family were looking for a place to go eat menudo, we wanted a real good, flavorful menudo, and while we were driving, Yelp! took us there, with the promise of good menudo. When we got there, there was a line, but that only meant to us, that there was good food too.\nWe were looking at the menu, while moving up to the cashier, and noticed that they do not serve menudo... like EVER! So, that was a little deceiving. (The website says they have it on Saturdays, but that is the day we visited and NADA!)\nWhen we got there, my kiddos got a bean and cheese burrito, which, if it wasn't for the good tortillas, it would have been the same as ordering one at taco bell. My hubby ordered the Oaxaca style burrito, that had nothing very \""""Oaxacan\"""" about (\""""Beef Chorizo with Beans, Potatoes, Cheese\""""... Oaxaca, me think not!), along with a tamal, don't remember what kind, didn't mater, wasn't good either.\nI ordered the green chile beef, which I was looking forward to. When we got our order, our kids enjoyed their burritos, my husband was OK with his, enjoyed the tortilla very much, but said that nothing special, and me, when I started eating it, a white goo came flowing out... it looked like the sticky goo we use to make home-made pi\u00f1atas called \""""Engrudo\"""", which is a mix of hot water and enough flour to get a gooey consistency, and I think that's what they served me with some chunks of tenderly cooked beef. I went up to the cashier, and told her that my green chile wasn't green, that it looked like \""""engrudo,\"""" she said that was the green chile, I asked \""""Is it supposed to look like this?\"""" she gave me a little shy smile and said yes... the ladies making the tortillas just looked up and smiled at me, and I went back to my seat, opened up my burrito, picked out the beef chunks, scraped off the goo, and ate my tortilla... So, no. If you ask me if I am going back to Carolina's again, my answer is no. It too long of a ride, too bad of a food for me to do that. Like I said, I've had better... and will post pics to show you the whitish \""""engrudo\"""" goo they served me... yuck!\n** Good thing I didn't get a cockroach in my burrito, like the other lady, that would have been so terrible!",0
C'Mon...  It's Carolina's!  I does not get any better than this if you want red chili burros.,1
"I just dont get what the big fascination with this place...\n\nIt's mediocre at best...\n\nI've had their beef hard shell tacos which are quiet greasy flavoress half the time.  Breakfast burrito was eh...would i go back willingly no, but if someone was buying me a free meal I couldnt go for it either.",0
"Gadz, this dumpy restaurant is in a neighborhood worse than mine!  Can you imagine?     :-)\n\nWith that said, what better place to have lunch on a cold, rainy day?  Yum!  Also, Carolina's here won't be so busy as usual with this weather, especially at 11 AM on a weekday.\n\nWell, so much for the last part.  This place was JUMPIN', and yes, it did take a little while to get my order, although you could see a zillion people running around back in the kitchen at full speed.     :-)\n\nOk, so I went with my usual, a #2 Combo, which brings a Beef Tamale, a Cheese Enchilada, refried beans with cheese on top, Spanish Rice, some shredded lettuce to mop up the tasty juice at the end, tortilla chips (free on request) & help-yourself salsa from a dispenser in the dining room.  I also added a hard shell Carne Deshebrada taco.\n\n*  OMG, the food is SO GOOD here, all the way down to their terrific salsa!  Every bite of it was just stellar!\n\nSo why is this place filled almost to capacity at 11 AM in the morning on a weekday when it's pouring rain?  'Cuz FOOD just doesn't get any better than this!!     :-))\n\n#2 Combination $5.65, Taco $2.  \u00a1Asombrosa!",1
"So once again, I ordered the wrong thing. I must have. Everyone loves this place, so it must be me. Most Yelp reviews are great (which is why we met there), the people I was with loved their food (a burro & a chimichanga), the various police officers who swiftly came in and out seemed to enjoy their food, but I thought mine sucked! This smarts, particularly because I was so looking forward to eating \""""good Mexican in a sketchy neighborhood,\"""" as I had told my cousin weeks ago was high on the to-do list for our trip to Phoenix. \n\nThe barbed wire behind the building, the rugged neighborhood, and the jammed paper towel dispenser in the restroom sure made it seem sketchy enough to be good, but the food disappointed me. So what gives?\n\nDoes it serve me right for not ordering off the giant menu on the wall? \n\nI asked if they could make enchiladas verdes and they said yes, so I went for it. The chicken, by the by, was fantastic--very white and tender and it looked great, especially in my cousin's burro, but the sauce on my enchiladas was not green, it was more of a MRSA-discharge yellow. In addition, the sauce was so creamy that it was goopy, it was flavorless, and it was not hot. (Er, it was not hot temperature-wise, nor was it spicy).\n\nMy cousin ordered chips and salsa with her burro (an enormous bag), so after I finished picking the chicken out of the enchiladas, I ate some of her chips using my refried beans as a dip. The salsa was good, though, and the kind of spicy that accumulates and sneaks up on you. Also, their pop machine dispenses horchata.  Still, I would not go to Carolina's again.",0
"Holy shit...I just found my most favorite Mexican food EVER...and it's about 1,500 miles from home! You've got to be kidding me, right?!? How's that for a slap in the face?!?  On a 6 day vacation, we ended up here 3 times and our drive was about 20-25 minutes each way. It's that good folks! If I lived closer, I would have been more adventures and tried more things on the menu...but the feeling of not eating more machacha made me want to cry. \n\nA #7 combo is where it's at. The machaca is AMAZING. I also had a bite of a chorizo burro, also amazing but I had to stick to the tacos. \n\nPro Tip: Don't be fooled by the horchata in the fountain drink thing-a-ma-bob....it's awesome! Give it a swish in your cup and you're good to go!",1
"What's with the rave about their tortillas? I get it. They're thin, fresh and comes out the foil steaming, but what's so special about them?\n\nThe original was tasteless (for obvious reasons). The butter tortilla was just you know...the original slathered in butter.\n\nMost of the food is just carb overload.\n\nThe machaca breakfast burrito was pure MUSH.",0
"Usually Mexican food served out of an outdated building with numerous building code violations is always the best. Not so much in the case of Carolina's. I arrived on a Saturday about 11 am to a short line and I had heard from one longtime Phoenix resident that this is the real deal. I had to try the famous tortillas right? So, I ordered up a cheese quesadilla and a red machaca burrito. How does it end up that Arizona and Nevada have completly different ideas of what machaca is. It is supposed to be dry beef grilled with onions, peppers, tomatoes and eggs. But in Phoenix, it is basically shredded wet beef doused in red or green sauce. Regardless, the Carolina's version was miserable. It was mushy and tasteless and since the thin tortillas could not hold all that beef inside, it turned into a knife and fork thing. I barely ate three bites of the mess and some fat was also discovered lurking in that meat.  Not good.\nSame thing with the quesadilla. Due to the tortilla being so thin, the cheese overwhelmed the item turning it into a cheese wafer. If I want Machaca, I'm heading back to Nevada next time to a state that knows the true definition of the dish.",0
"Went here for lunch last week. We left the office at 11:15 and got there around 11:30 and it wasn't that busy with all the crazy lines yet. But the dining area was jam packed. Once we ordered though there was a huge line that was forming.  I order a beef tamale and a machaca hard taco for under 5 dollars.  Even though they say soft only for the machaca taco, they will do a hard taco for you. I ate the taco at work and I brought home my tamale and decided to give it to my husband and he ate it seriously in 2 mins. What a fatty!\n\nYes, the place is a hole in the wall.  The place may look shady. However, I must say I would make the trip down here any day of the week so I can eat their food. I used to eat here 2 times a week when I worked down the street. Tip: When you want to go during lunch, make sure to call ahead and place an order because you might be waiting for a while or if you go after 1:30 it calms down more so you can find a seat and enjoy your food.  These are the only 2 things that I have gotten when I go here. Next time I will branch out and get something else to try it out.",1
"I have been going to this restaurant since I was a child, and it only gets better! Carolina's is definitely not known for the 5 star accommodations it provides. Rather people come here again and again, simply because it is INCREDIBLE food. The tortillas especially are to die for. One of the best tortillas I have ever had (La Purisima has good ones as well).  I ahve never had a bad meal at Carolinas! The prices don;t hurt your wallet either!",1
"I don't pretend to be an expert on Mexican food. But, oh man, isn't the food unnecessarily greasy here? I got a chicken burrito and the grease was dripping down my hands to my arms! Flies everywhere in March (!). . . Cannot possibly imagine coming here during the summer time. I'm from Tucson and I started to think Mexican food means something different to me. But seriously, what are you eating here in Phoenix?",0
"I am pretty much done trying to eat at this restaurant. The last THREE times I've come to Phoenix, they've been closed, including today. No information on their website, just a sign on the door as I'm standing in the ghetto, starving. I really love their food, but am frustrated that they have such terrible hours.",0
My favorite Mexican food! I always order  a machaca potato and extra cheese burro. The cheese quesadillas and tortillas are delicious too. I like to wash it down with some of their horchata. I am not a fan of eating at the restaurant as it's a little ghetto but it is very clean. I recommend calling in the order since it gets really busy sometimes.,1
The food is ASTOUNDING!!! Watch out for the enchiladas because they pack a spicy and delicious punch! Cudos on the amazing tortillas too!,1
"It's good, we have this for lunch every time my boss likes to buy us lunch. Great tortillas!!",1
"Gorged on green Chile and machaca meat tacos, but the salsas were what made the meal.  The red salsa that came with chips was outstanding, hot but with a slowly increasing burn.  The salsa available from the dispensers by the soda machines was subtly different with more heat and a more acidic feel.  I love rat hole Mexican and this may be the best I've ever had.",1
"The reason to come to Phoenix! I love this place- quite authentic and honest. My favorite is the chorizo and potatoes with tortillas. Spicy, salty deliciousness. We bought tortillas to take home- they are worth the trip alone. Slightly salty with that perfect puerco after bite. And the fountain sodas have that perfect tiny slushy ice and strong coca cola. I give Carolina's two thumbs up.",1
"A Christmas Eve tragedy! My husband purchased 1 dozen green corn tamales and a half dozen green chicken tamales for Christmas Eve. So here it is Christmas Eve and we just unpacked the order to discover we only have 11 green corn tamales -- no chicken tamales at all. Very very very bad! He said they were very disorganized when he was there, bad service. I will only go to the Cave Creek location from now on. Merry freaking Christmas!",0
"I was so upset about this place that I had to write my first review today.  I went to Carolinas today and placed my order.  I waited for about 15-20 minutes.  People who ordered after me started to get their food.  So I went up to the counter to the lady calling out numbers and giving the food to the people.  She couldn't find my order.  She was starting to tell the cooks to make my order but at this point I asked for my receipt back because I wanted my money back.  The girl said without being apologetic that I needed to go over to where I ordered to get my money back.  So I went back to the guy who took the order and asked for my money back.  He didn't ask what happened just opened the cash register and handed me money.  No apologies from anybody or acknowledgment of the fact that we waited and had no food. \nI think this place has okay food but I will never go back because this food isn't SO great that I need to deal with the service that doesn't care about keeping customers happy. \nThere are much better places that I don't fear food poisoning from that are really nice to their customers.  I say the previous sentence because people who have been the place know that it isn't the nicest place.  In fact, it is the worst looking place that I have ever seen.  I can't believe I've eaten here in the past due to the way it looks.",0
"To call this place a dive would be too flattering. it's a dump! What isn't filthy or broken is missing ,like good food How this place is in business is a mystery to me. Are there no health inspectors in that part of town?",0
"If the reviews were based strictly on food, Carolina's would get 5 stars. My brother and his family took us there for the \""""best Mexican food in Phoenix\"""". I wouldn't have gone if it wasn't for my family's experience there. It's in a sketchy neighborhood and looks really run down, but looks can be deceiving. The food was amazing!",1
"Seriously Carolina's? This place is not at all what I expected it to be. It's busy. There was a line bigger than the restaurant... But super disappointing once my food arrived... 45 minutes later. I got a machaca burrito (apparently that's what the rave was about) and was completely dissatisfied. My husband had the shredded beef tacos and a green tamale (dry with sweet masa, BLEH). Nothing to write home about. I've been searching far and wide for an authentic Mexican food place and these Arizona places are nothing compared to the real food back home in the streets of LA! You people have no idea what good food is... Sorry.",0
"The sketchy neighborhood and bars on the windows ALMOST pushed me away. This is from the website \"""" The character of the neighborhood is etched on the building's cinder-block facade. The restaurant's skin has been pockmarked by bullets and its windows and doors outfitted with heavy metal security bars.\""""\n\nI decided I've been to worse (downtown Cincinnati) and that there was a nice mix of clientele so I gathered my cash and my camera and crossed the threshold. The floor was concrete, the walls chipped and dirty and the atmosphere...authentic. I felt like I was in Mexico. I stared at the menu but I already knew I wanted...Machacha and Eggs (recommended on Yelp). I was extremely relieved when I got to the counter and the young girl taking my order spoke perfectly clear English, so asking questions was easy. You order, you get a number, you wait, you eat. Easy enough.  Oh and cash only!\n\nAfter making my order, I wandered into the large, adjoining room to find a seat. It was just as shabby and the atmosphere buzzed with chatter. Carolina's is best known for its flour tortilla - a large, delicately thin and slightly chewy affair that makes the most elegant wrap for the restaurant's divine burro.\n\nThe tortillas, which are available by the dozen for takeout, are churned out by a crew of workers who stand before a bank of hot griddles, deftly flipping the paper thin rounds of dough and piling them up for packaging. So I had a machaca and egg burrito and a taco. The burrito was yummy, the tortilla soft, but I'm so glad I got that taco. The shell was so crunchy, so fresh, so good. I really want another Carolina taco.",1
"Yes it is a dive but it is some of the best Mexican food I have tried. It's not \""""authentic\"""" in a LA food truck or tacqueria way, but more like your Mexican grandmother's kitchen (if you had a Mexican grandmother).  I think they put crack in the tortillas; usually the tortillas are just a vessel/carrying case for tastiness, but the tortillas here are amazing. The stuff inside is great too and the hot sauce is typical Mexican. Thumbs up!  Especially the Machaca.",1
"Upon arrival at this Phoenix dive, one instantly senses tradition, history, character and the possibilities of something memorable. The food is in take out / fast food style, and the very reasonable prices match the ambience. The restaurant was packed at lunch, but the service was friendly and fast. \n\nI chose the green chili burrito and the butter tortilla. I'm trying not to eat carbohydrates, but how can one refrain when you are at the best tortilla factory in Phoenix? I enjoyed the green chili chicken filling in the burrito, but I do wish I had covered it in a salsa, sauce or cheese. \n\nThis place is the real thing, and a fun adventure.",1
I just got done eating another shitty taco in Illinois. It made me realize how great  the Mexican Food is in Arizona.\n\nCarolina's is in the holy grail category: it could very well be my last meal on earth and I'd die with a smile on my face.,1
"I've heard a lot about this place over the ten years I've lived in the valley. I've always wanted to try it and see what all the fuss is about. I've heard several times that they have the best Mexican food in the valley. \n\nI went for lunch during the week and ordered a green chile burrito and a red tamale. The burrito was runny and soggy and the inside was almost like a can if Dinty Moore, the tamale was dry, very little meat, too much masa and didn't taste very good. It was a complete let down after hearing so much over the years and I would say that any local Filabertos has better food after my first visit. I'll give it another shot and that might change my review some.\n\nThe other reviews mention it's legacy and the dive location so I'll let them cover that as well as the butter tortillas.",0
Classic example of people thinking that a hole in the wall place that is super ghetto must be good because it is a secret from everyday society..... NOT.  Tortillas are good but that's where the praise ends. I had a burrito and I swear I could make a better one myself with a can of chicken and enchilada sauce. Throw in microwave. Served! Next time I'll save the 6 bucks.,0
"Just ate here and have never been so disappointed in a local Mexican restaurant. The green chili and beef burro consisted of 90 percent beans, 5 percent green chili mush and 5 percent beef. Both burros we got fell apart completely as soon as we lifted them up to take a bite - all of the filling came out of the bottom. My mom got the enchiladas. The sauce was okay but the tortillas were stale and difficult to cut through and chew. I wish I could say that my experience was at least satisfying but it sadly wasn't.",0
Awesome and authentic food. No frills- just delicious. Buy some homemade tortillas to take home!,1
"It wasn't lunch time or anything, but how can you just drive right on by a Carolina's if you've ever tasted their food?     :-)\n\nSO, I was out running errands and got vacuumed right off the street into this place at 10 in the morning.  Actually, 10 AM on a Wednesday is a good time to come here, when the line of people waiting to order isn't all the way through the building!  I got right up to the counter almost immediately and ordered my \""""usual\"""" for a Carolina's:  #2 Combo ($5.65) plus a shredded beef hard taco ($2).  Here's how it all was this time:\n\n*  The atmosphere?  This Carolina's is a raggety dump!\n\n*  The service, after ordering?  Slow!  (10 or 15 minutes!)\n\n*  The food?  OUT OF THIS WORLD GOOD!!  (That's one thing, isn't it?)\n\n*  The value?  Good.  In fact, prices haven't increased in the 3 1/2 years since my first visit.\n\nSO, I still love this place.  Now if you need a little nicer dining room, go to their Peoria location.  If you need a MUCH NICER dining room, go to the one up on Cactus west of the 51.  Also, don't let anyone tell you that Chef So-and-So at this or that Carolina's is the only one who knows what he is doing.  The food is exactly the same at all 3 locations...  TERRIFIC!     :-))\n\nClosed Sundays & Holidays.  Free Wi-Fi.",1
Good was not very good. The venue was so outdated the only good thing were the flour tortillas,0
"I guess by now all you people are so used to the crappy Mexican in phoenix that you think this is the max.  I guess to each his own but my Idea of good Mexican is not soggy tortillas, food that tastes like cumin a trashy dump that is not clean, there is no way you can clean a place like this they make enough money to at least put in a decent floor, but trust me you eat what you see.",0
"Get food to go.  Tacos are excellent, the fresh made tortilla's are to die for",1
"How Good Depends On What You Order.\n\n I have been to Carolina's a few times, after all it's close to where I work.  The food at Carolona's is hit or miss and the quality really depends on what you order.  Carolina's is a small one story white stucco building with barred windows and doors. The side of the building has huge letters spelling out \""""Carolina's\"""".  Once inside you walk up to the  order windows  and select your entr\u00e9e from a large menu above the windows. \n\n As you wait for your entree to arrive you can hear staff calling out order numbers. Once our number was called we made our way up front grabbed our plates and asked for some salsa, that is  available in small paper cups filled by big stainless steel mustard/ketchup pump dispensers.\n\nThe hard-shell machaca taco, rice and beans, horchata and tortillas a in the past were amazing. However, I found the cheese enchiladas to be mediocre (tortillas are hard, very little cheese, However, the red sauce is  tasty).  Today I ordered the beef tamale plate and to be honest my entr\u00e9e was  pretty awful more fat than beef in the tamale, and the tamales had an overwhelming taste of oil. The meal just wasn't very good.\n\nIt might be a while before I decide to re-visit Carolina's.",0
"I am really torn about this place. It has all the markings of a top notch food joint. Hole-in-the-wall characteristics that gives it a certain \""""feel\"""" of authenticity. I've been to Mexico several times and the best tacos ive ever had were from street vendors, not the restaurant adjacent to the (insert touristy hotel here). \nSo i had high hopes, and everyone told me if i wanted legit mexican food in Phoenix, this is where you roll to. \nThe pricing is unbeatable, especially for the portion sizes. \nSo i get the salsa/hot sauce, and its great. I went here right before close so ill give them a pass, but the tortilla chips were no bueno. They just tasted like bulk chips you would get from taco bell or something like that. Or like some bulk generic chip bag from Sams Club. Enough with crappy analogies, they just weren't that good.\nSo on to the tacos... The crispy tacos were ON POINT! Amazing, great flavor, crispy shell, exactly what i had hoped for. Some of the best crispy tacos id ever had (in mexico i had only seen and eaten soft tacos).\nThe soft tacos were good but way to soggy. Like you would take a bite and the soft shell would disintegrate in your hand. So why if the chips sucked and the soft tacos were sub par do i give it 4 stars?\nThe chips, its like who cares. If i go to red lobster and the rolls arent warmed all the way, im not bashing the whole meal. \nAnd for the soft tacos, im not sure what was up with those. But from some of the other dishes i tried with the party i was with everything else seemed fantastic. So.... you need to go here.... just lower your expectations on soggy soft tacos.",1
"Hands down the best Mexican food you will find ! The tortillas are huge and you can buy them for home ! The place is a whole in the wall but well worth stopping for , it's super close to the airport so be sure to stop by either after or before u get to the airport",1
"Go hungry! This place has THE BEST Mexican food in Arizona. Hands down. Yes, it is in a bad part of town. Yes the place looks like a total $#!% hole. But the food makes up for it 100000%. \n\nNo matter what you order, I promise you will not be disappointed. However, if you do order a burrito, order it double-wrapped. And do yourself a favor and get a order of the fresh tortillas to go. Amazing! At $3/dozen you will not be sorry. \n\nI am torn on this one issue though....would I want this place to re-locate to a better area? Remodel to improve the atmosphere? I dont know...I feel like if they did it may get even more popular and then Id be annoyed.",1
"I love Carolina's. Just not yesterday, November 11th, @1:45pm at the Mohave St. location. Just to be sure. \n\nNow, it's not my fault I only have 30 minutes for lunch so I went to Carolina's at the Mohave St location and I ordered a taco and enchilada, both beef. 14 minutes later my food arrived. The place was not crowded and that's too long for a taco and enchilada.  My God, there's 10 people - minimum - in the damn kitchen...\n\nSO SLOW AT THIS LOCATION. This horribly slow service has NEVER occurred at the Cactus or Sun City locations and I've been eating there for years\n\nThe taco was delicious, the enchilada not so much.  Three small cubes of beef in the whole enchilada!  The corn tortilla was old and tough. Or very tough and old. There was lots of gravy (red sauce) which is good, but not to cover the less-than-minimum amount of beef. It's not a beef enchilada if it doesn't have any beef. \n\nBut the really bad news is the food made me ill: 90 minutes later: Cramps, diarrhea.   And I've got a cast-iron stomach so it isn't me it, was the food. \n\nSo let's review what we learned: slow service, 1 hit 1 BIG miss on the $8 taco/enchilada/soda they-ain't-giving- anything-away package , that, oh, by the way, made me ill.  thanks for nuthin'!\n\nNever again this location.  You either if you're smart.",0
After waiting 45 minutes for an order of chorizo eggs and a green chili burrito I told my friend let's leave. There were only a dozen or two dozen people there at least 10 people working behind the counter in the kitchen and they can't get the orders out. Place sucks,0
"If you're looking for good authentic mexican food, Carolina's is the place to be. I recommend going during the day since it's not in the best part of town. I ordered a chimichanga, that was the perfect amount of crispiness and loaded with shredded beef and cheese. It was topped with a generous amount of guacamole & sour cream with refried beans and bland rice on the side. You really can't beat the prices here.\nThe reason I'm giving it two stars is mostly due to the fact that it's a complete hole in the wall, heck, I wouldn't be surprised if there were actual holes in the walls.",0
"After reading some less than flattering reviews of Carolina's, I thought I would come to the defense of this iconic Mexican restaurant in downtown Phoenix, named after the kind owner. You see, I was craving some good Mexican after this bowl of cheap ice cream I just had for dinner (don't ask), and harkened back to a time when I'd frequent Carolina's while working in Phoenix in the 90's. \n\nI think I have the bad reviews figured out, save for the gal whose rear end turned into a fire hose: The people were SCARED of the place, the area, everything. Yes, Carolina's is what you would call a dive, with a capital D. And, it is in the HOOD. I mean no disrespect by that, it's just what it is. When you consider the whole package- the neighborhood, the building, signage, interior, etc. it could definitely put some people off who are not used to such a thing. I mean, I understand, because I'm a guy, I'm not small, and the first time I went there I thought I'd be gunned down or kidnapped by MS-13 or something. Seriously, driving there I was aghast as I had never seen people in the US living in 40 year old, busted up cabover campers sitting on the dirt, with plywood shacks surrounding them. Not kidding.\n\nBut the food, the handmade flour tortillas, it's divine. When somebody cries that their soft taco just didn't hit the spot, I wonder WTF they were expecting. Maybe Taco Bell? How about get an imagination and order the Machaca Beef and Bean Burro and turn into an absolute wild animal because you can't eat it fast enough? That's what I'm talking about.",1
"Good food and better music ... A great hang out place... I wont certainly recommend it for a 3 course dinner or such, but definitely a great place to get together with some of your good ol'd buddies... And yeah, chicken wings are awsome !!",1
"Update:\n\nI don't mind $8.5 for wings as that is about average for a dozen wings. But when I get them and there are only 6, I'm never coming back to your restaurant. $17 for a dozen buffalo wings? HA! What the hell are you guys thinking?",0
"This Review Brought to you by the Letter \""""L\""""\n\nBobby C's has become somewhat of a tradition for us on Light Rail Pub Crawls.  We found them by accident the first time when my friend shoved me off the train and I almost got left behind....\n\nThe first time we went in, they seemed excited to have our business and we were almost sad to go.\n\nThe second time they had live music playing, and they wanted to charge a cover.  Since we were only there for one drink, we were about to pass, when they offered us the VIP room.  Basically, they stuck us in a dining room that's not connected to the main bar.  But they brought us our own bartender and hooked us up. \n\nBased on the first 2 visits, my review should be higher, but then we went on Friday.  Ok, so a group of 20 already somewhat intoxicated people are somewhat daunting.  Plus - they waived cover if you had an active light rail pass.  Minus - they segregated us into the back room again.  \n\nWhat really gives them this ranking, is that we were drinking the alphabet and were on the letter \""""L\"""" (bet you didn't see that one coming.)  So we ordered Lemondrops - see they start with the letter L - now it all becomes clear.\n\nOk, not sure what planet they got these \""""lemons\"""" from - but my god they were terrible.  Ass drops was more like it.  I mean, horrible.  I can't even describe the taste.  We tried dumping sugar into them, no help.  Finally, we poured sprite into the drinks and by plugging our noses, were able to choke them down.  Well, I drank Brian's in addition to my own (I wasn't gonna waste the booze!)\n\nWe felt pressured to stay, but with no music, no entertainment at all and no decent drinks, we had to boogie back to the train.  \n\nWill Bobby C's stay on our rotation, possibly, as it's such a tradition now, I'm just glad we have stops before and after it!",0
"Double dated last night for Jazz nite @ Bobby C's. They were very welcoming there. Even though it was our waitresses first night, she did a great job! \n\nThe enormous fried BBQ shrimp were delicious with the magic white/tangy sauce that was brought out with them. The fried catfish was perfectly cooked and also got a smattering of that delicious sauce. The collard greens were salty, but to the approval of my boyfriend (who can't get enough salt). I balanced the saltiness of the collard greens with the candied yams (I can't get enough sweet)! \nThe portions are generous and once again, that sauce is perfection! \n\nWe enjoyed the free Jazz that was playing, \""""The Adam Clark Trio\"""". They were very entertaining, and I suggest seeing them on Tuesday nights. \n\nI will definitely be back!!",1
".  Angel, daughter of the Lounge's owner Joy is a HOOT!!  I love her personality.  It's not a fancy place, little hole in the wall type place. They have been open for 8 years and have had a pretty steady following.  There is art on the walls (LOVE the Dizzie Gillespie painting... thinking of buying it) painted by a local artist.  Live music on Wednesdays/Fridays.  Wednesdays step classes (the Al B. look alike) and they have another separate dining-type area.  Wednesday nights they hold something called a conversation party.  Random 5 topics are chosen (we had a peek at last night's conversations) EX:  Are momma's boys a good or bad thing?   What makes a partner in a relationship think they need to start playing games?  What is most important to you in your professional career?\n\nApparently some of these discussions, as you can imagine - adding the alcohol ingredient - can get pretty heated.  It seemed to be a big group last night... 15-20 people.  \n\nSo after dinner, catfish, PORK CHOPS TO DIE FOR!! So tender, fried hot wings, mac 'n cheese, mashed potatoes, LOTS AND LOTS of hot sauce, we heard the band start warming up.   YES!!  GREAT music.  People walked in wearing their Sunday best and others walked in wearing jeans.  It's an everyone knows everyone's name type of place.  Older people and the younger started trickling in around 8PM.  \n\nDefinitely a fun experience.  Good times.",1
"I loved this place! Although not very diverse in the makeup of the crowd (we were the only Latinos in the place), it had a great vibe and a very friendly atmosphere. The bartenders were awesome and the drinks were great! Angel, the female bartender, was as sweet as can be and chatted with us for a few minutes. She actually grew up in the Bay Area (where I currently live), so it was nice to talk to someone from the area. LOVED HER. Chris, the male bartender, was also very friendly and kept checking with us to make sure we were doing alright. The DJ was playing a mix of Old School Funk with a little R&B, which was great for the relaxed atmosphere. The bar area has cameras showing what's going on on the dance floor in the other room, which was kind of interesting. All in all, we had a great time. I'll definitely be coming back to Bobby C's the next time I'm in Phoenix!",1

They have really good soups and cheap lunch specials as well. \n\nAlso the exterior paint color seems to change every time I go, which makes me laugh.  Work it, Wong's.",1
"I love Wong's!  I think it's the best orange chicken in the valley. They use only white meat chicken. I hear their egg rolls and fried rice are the best, too!\n\nWong's is a hole in the wall. There's no getting around it. It's not the prettiest, and if you've ever had to use their restroom you know that they could seriously do some remodeling, but it's clean (just old, and falling apart). The atmosphere is the only thing keeping it from being a 5-star place. The food is top notch!",1
"Now that is some sad Chinese food. Cheap yes, but not good. I was hoping to find that \"""" hole in the wall\"""" place that nobody would try without knowing. But it is a rundown crappy place with not so good food.",0
"One of my favorite Chinese food place in the valley, the service was great the food was amazing.  The only thing I didn't like was the location but they have been here 30+ years.",1
"Did you ever wish there was some undiscovered place left in Phoenix that has absolutely amazing food?  This is it!!!  I'd pay double for the humble ambiance and the sweet Chinese lady who served us.  The food was fresh, fresh, fresh.  Yum!  I am loathe to tell you about his because once this 35 year old gem is discovered, I won't be able to get a table.",1
"I've been coming here since I was a kid! Wong's is such a great place, very noticeable from the street with its bright red exterior. The interior hasn't changed at all! I remember their huge refrigerator off to the side as a kid and that thing is still alive and kickin! It's definitely outdated but it's totally the charm of the place. \nNow for the food. I'm not gonna lie, I used to be extremely picky as a kid and would only get the teriyaki chicken or the house chicken. Now as an adult I've ventured off and tried new things. I think I've had everything on the menu at least once throughout my lifetime. My favorite dish currently is the Emperor's Favorite, chicken and shrimp with mixed veggies in a spicy white sauce. Yum! The soups are also amazing. I'm a huge fan of egg drop soup and Wong's just knows how to do it. If I were you I would also try the egg rolls, so good! and only $1 per egg roll! \n\nI'll always be a fan of Wong's and it will always be my go to Chinese restaurant.",1
"The orange chicken is great!!! So are the egg rolls. I don't really like fried rice but the orange chicken combined works well with it. I haven't found a place with good sesame chicken at all, but this place makes me forget all about East coast sesame chicken! The inside looks like you're in some local Chinese province (if you can relate), but the takeout option is fast and friendly.",1
"I can't begin to say how many problems we had with this company.  First we have to say our sales person was pretty worthless.  He dropped his camera on his first visit out so he didn't have accurate pictures of our pool area which made the plans inaccurate.  We then made arrangements on the sails and placement based on what we were told by the sales person.  The installers came out when we were not home to put up the brackets and much to my dismay, left a large bolt laying out where my toddlers could choke on it.  They also changed our radio which meant they felt they could touch our stuff.  The most disturbing thing was that we were no longer to locate our son's dump truck that he carefully parked on the porch.  After circling the yard many times over with him at my heels I called the sales person who seemed appropriately concerned.  Again after looking I found the truck tucked behind a box right by the gate to exit our yard.  It was obvious someone either was considering stealing it at some point.  I was livid at this point.  The sales person became dismissive and we demanded to talk to the owner.  After quite a few days he called and was somewhat helpful.  We demanded that the sales person accompany the installers which he attempted to get out of.  The next problem was that after the shades were installed our deep end of the pool was shaded but not the shallow end which was our express reason for putting the sails up in the first place.  The sales person came out and came up with some ideas but proved to be pretty incompetent.  So when they moved the shade they had to cut some of the fabric off but still wanted to charge us for the fabric they didn't use.  Since the fabric is the most expensive part of the shade, we were quite upset about this.  After they finished installing the shade, the sales person asked repeatedly for payment without reconciling the cost.  This took multiple emails and calls to the sales person before it was finally resolved.  The only other compliant I had was that the sails sag, which we were guaranteed not to.  Hopefully this will be corrected.   I would not recommend this company.",0
this company is wonderfull they ware fast  and they did a wonderfull job thank you !,1
"Art at Tom's Auto Body is terrific!   He made the process as painless as possible.  In fact I originally found this place via Yelp.  Thanks fellow Yelpers!!   I wanted to get ran estimate from a couple of different places and do Tom's Auto Body was my firsts stop.  I spoke to Art and he gave me all the info I needed basically from what would need to be replaced and looked at (e.g. Wheel alignment) to what I should say to My auto insurance to speed up the repair process.  Needless to say, I was so impressed with my first meeting with Art that I decided to forego  getting a second opinion and just stuck with them.  Mind you this all happened on a Friday.  \n\nThe following Monday I dropped off my vehicle after getting it cleared with my insurance.  From there, Art kept me posted only vehicle status.  They quoted my three weeks for the repair and I got it back in two.  \n\nI HIGHLY recommend Tom's Auto Body!!!   You will not be disappointed.  My vehicle looks brand new and it is covered as long as I own the vehicle.",1

"Compared to my other experience with a cab company in Phoenix, the AAA Yellow Cab was like the heavens parting and saving me. (See clean air cab for the traumatic story of before).\n\nNot wanting a repeat of our frightening first night in Phoenix we decided to go with a cab company we actually  recognized and I'm so glad we did. When they arrived they came into our hotel lobby to find us and called out my name, I'm glad they did because I was expecting a yellow cab and it was a white cab with \""""AAA Yellow Cab\"""" written on the side. I didn't even know they were the same company!\n\nThe driver knew the area we were going to, asked for the address before starting the meter and plugged it into the GPS. We got there with no trouble, the cab was clean, the driver and his co-driver (who I think was in training) were polite and told us random facts about Phoenix as we were driving as soon as they found out we were from out of town. \n\nTheir credit card machine wasn't working yet but they did have a hand CC machine to take them. Although it was a little more expensive than other companies, the money was worth it for my safety and sanity!!",1
"It took me an hour and a half to get home from work this morning.I work at St Lukes Medical Center at 1800 e. Van Buren and was sitting on the wall out side the main entrance where the flagpole is.Nothing could be simpler.I don't have a cell phone.So I had to periodically go back in and use the phone at the front desk. I was told the driver said I wasn't there.I was the ONLY person in sight.The driver and I couldn't possibly have missed each other.I called about five times.I use this company several times a week to get home (about 4 miles) and usually it takes no longer than ten minutes to be picked up.As the time stretched on,the employees became increasingly rude and eventually kept hanging up on me.I finally called another company when one of triple A's drivers finally showed up. \nI don't have luggage.I'm alone and pay cash and always tip.You'd think the company would value a customer like this three times a week.Apparently not.\nHarold Roush",0
"If you need to anywhere in a timely manner, avoid AAA yellow cab at all costs! I called for a cab to take me to the airport this morning, and was told that it would take 5 to 15 minutes for my cab to arrive. Perfect because i had plenty of time. After 10 minutes I took all of my bags out to the curb, and proceeded to wait for another 30 minutes. Because my 15 minutes cab wait took 40 minutes i ended up missing my flight.\n\nI called AA yellow cab asking them for a complimentary ride back home from the airport, and they refused. I was told that they recommend 2 hours for airport pickup, which I was not told when I made the call for pickup. If I had any idea that it could potentially take that long, I would have arranged for other transportation.  The agent was also unable to put me in contact with a supervisor. I was told I would get a phone call three days later after a \""""full investigavtion\"""" had been done. This sounds to me like customer service code for \""""you'll never hear from us again.\"""" \n\nThere are cab companies in Phoenix that you can rely on. AAA Yellow cab isdefinitely NOT one of them.",0
"I accidentally left my keys in the cab and it was the biggest nightmare ever getting my keys back.  I called the dispatcher and they refused to give me the drivers cell phone number and they told me they were going to call the driver and that \""""If the driver has the keys he will bring them to me at the airport\"""".  Finally after calling several people they told me that the driver said he found the keys and was returning them to the lost and found.\n\nThis is where the nightmare started. I called several times after that and spoke with several people to see if my keys were ever returned. I kept getting bounced around from person to person each person telling me when I described them that the keys were nowhere to be found. Finally somebody told me that they found my keys and were writing my name \""""David\"""" on a sticky and putting them in a safe place. My fears were resolved.\n\nI got back to Phoenix and they offered to drive the keys to me but in exchange I would have to pay the cab fare (which I had no problem doing). I agreed to this but first they made me fax all sorts of documents and pictures of my credit cards. This was a huge headache. When it was all done they told me a driver will be at my house within an hour with the keys. The driver finally shows up and it's the wrong keys!!!! \n\nI called back Triple A and they refused to talk to me or answer any questions and were now very rude to me on the phone.  I told them that I wanted to email them a picture of exactly what my keys looked like and if they could just go through again and match the picture with the keys, it would help me out knowing that they had my keys and I won't have to waste a bunch of money on a cab to drive out there. They refused and told me I would have to come myself.\n\nI finally called up a different cab company (because they were rude to me on the phone, I wasn't going to give them any more of my business) and had Vip Taxi drive me out to Triple A Yellow Cab to go on the hunt for my keys.\n\nI got to the Triple A Yellow cab and their lost and found was a complete mess. They had sunglasses, phones, keys, credit cards, and drivers licenses all in a big box. It took 15 minutes for one of the higher ups but he found my keys. Now why couldn't I have just emailed them my picture and they could have gone through the keys until they found mine? \n\nThis is what my mom calls \""""Penny wise but pound foolish\"""".  They might have thought I was wasting their time and that I spent enough of their time already thus they ended the call, but now they've lost a customer for life. Was it a good business move to blow me off and risk losing a customer?",0
AAA yellow cab is clueless.  I set up a time to be picked up and they made me miss my flight because they only dispatched 1 taxi to pick me up when the Mesa airport was 5 minute from my house and I had to wait on phone over 25 minute to get them to dispatch a taxi that would pick me up.  I missed my flight home to WA state and now I have to arrive home 5 hours later while kids are already asleep. I wouldn't recommend to anyone....,0
"Called for a cab from the hospital, but instead of 15 minutes, waited almost an hour.  Claimed there was some mixup.  When the cab did come, the driver drove past the front area I was waiting and almost left the area.  Had to run after him.  DId not open the door either at the start of the trip or the end of the trip.  AC was running, but felt like the heater was on in 90+degree weather.  Would not recommend to anyone.  Triple AAA should be renamed Triple ZZZ.",0
"Triple A is a convenient name because they triple charged my credit card when the credit card machine wasn't working, which the drivers and other yelpers say is a really common problem. I disputed two of the three charges and they insist that there was no third payment. I'm looking at my account right now and, yup, there's the charge with no refund from a month ago. So they've had my money all this time and they're arguing with me because... ??? Stay away from Triple A unless you're ok with paying multiple times for one cab ride and/or enjoy spending A LOT of time disputing charges.\n\nThat cab driver was nice though. I took the cab home from the airport and we spent an extra 10 or so minutes trying to get the credit card machine to work which was frustrating at the end of a long day of travelling. The CC machine was looking like it wasn't working and was saying that the transaction didn't go through. So I don't blame the driver. But wow, if a business triple charges me and then fights me on whether I should get refunded for 2/3 charges, that is an enormous problem.\n\nUpdate: they ended up refunding the two extra charges. Phew! But save yourself the headache and only go with Triple A if you have cash. At the Phoenix Airport, I have just asked the cab coordinator to get me a different cab company if I didn't have cash and this has worked out just fine.",0
"I can't give this a zero, so I guess one star is bad enough. Reserve online? They either lose the reservation or don't bother. The customer service is lousy, and like to lie often. The cs agent named Jose, if that's his real name, claimed a cab would arrive in five minutes, and outward lie. Fifteen minutes later, when I called back, I was informed my reservation meant nothing to them, they had other people waiting. By the way, I had reserved the cab the night before. One word summarizes this company: scumbags.",0
"Is there less than a one star? WORST cab experiences EVER! I travel extensively for buisness and have never ever encountered such ignorance, incompetence and hostility.\n\nFirst cab driver got horribly lost. He claimed his GPS didn't work.

When I finally did answer, he harassed me on the phone after I was at my hotel to be sure I didn't \""""complain\"""". Are you kidding me????\n\nRide back to the airport was no better. My client booked the ride and when I got to the cab there was a very mean, harassing phone call from a dispatcher chewing me out for not being on time. My client booked one ride, then cancelled and booked a second for 15 min later. Dispatcher decided to yell at me instead. Lucky I saved the voice mail.

"So, after a night out my friends and I played it safe and took a taxi home, leaving my car by Acme. The next morning, I had several appointments to attend to, and thus I called yellow cab to get a ride back to my car. I called at 9:50 am on Wednesday morning. When my cab hadn't showed up by 10:20, I called to find out what's up, and was told that the taxi hadn't been dispatched yet. Like, really? 30 minutes? Really? Its not like its sunday morning, its wednesday! She apologized and said it would be ten minutes. I'm now in a time crunch. 15 more minutes go by...it's now been 45 minutes since I ordered the taxi! I could have walked there by now! I called another cab company all together, and they showed up in 3 minutes. 3. I cancelled my cab with yellow cab and will never call them again.",0
"We called Yellow Cab for a cab and were told it would be 15-35 minutes. We called after 30 minutes to check the status and were told it would just be a \""""few more minutes\"""".

Never using Yellow Cab again.",0
"We called 1.5 hrs before we needed a pickup. Time sensitive - we have a flight to catch. 15 min after scheduled pickup, we call them only for them to tell us they have no cabs available and are trying to find one. Now we might miss our flight. Terrible customer service... If you have NO CABS you TELL THE CUSTOMER. Will never use them again.\n\nAddition:\n\nSo on the way to the airport, we tell our new cab driver what happened. He used to drive for this local Yellow Cab company (more than 10 years) and could tell us the whole history. It was fascinating, and sad.\n\nApparently, a smaller cab company owned by Iranians grew by taking government vouchers to take people to doctor's appointments. Not a bad deal, except the cab company only passed along $1 for every $7 to the drivers, keeping $1 for expenses and $1 for employees and profiting $5 off the government. That cab company grew so much so fast under this scenario, they bought Yellow Cab.\n\nNow, what used to be a great cab company is run terribly. The former employee told us the company leadership hated owner-operators like himself, because they advocated for a fair wage. Customer service and cab dispatch are in totally different buildings, meaning you'll never get an adequate response when you call.\n\nHealth care voucher rides will always take precedence over individual calls, and judging by other Yelp reviews, that will continue to happen. I would never, ever call this cab company again.",0
"My trips to the airport these days are stress-free. Discount Cab takes me there. The drivers are capable and courteous, and the rates are reasonable. \n\nIf only they could pick me up on the way back.\n\nMy trips FROM the airport are with Yellow Cab, who seem to have some semi-exclusive arrangement with the airport, at least out of terminal 3. Discount is prohibited from picking up at the airport.\n\nSo I am left with Yellow Cab most of the time.

"My family and I were heading out on vacation for a couple of weeks and scheduled a Yellow Cab to pick us up from our house to take us to the airport.  I reserved a mini-van as we had considerable luggage and two small kids.  Everything was set for a 6:30 AM pick-up.  Needless to say these guys are horrible.  Here's a summary of events:\n\n6:40 - Called Yellow Cab because the cab we reserved had not arrived at our house.  I'm told that the driver is running late and will be there in 5 minutes.\n\n6:46 - Driver still not there.  Called Yellow Cab and am informed that nobody is en route and they don't know when a driver will be available to pick us up.  Two things wrong with this.  One, I had a reservation.  Two, the previous dispatcher told me someone was on there way and would be there in five minutes.  I ask Chris to secure a cab for me and call me back in five minutes to let me know when they will be at my house.\n\n6:57 - I call Yellow Cab again.  No cab.  No return phone call from Chris (the dispatcher).  At this point we are going to miss our flight if we don't jump in our car and head to the airport.\n\n7:00 - I pack up my car, put the car seats back in my car, load up the family, and start heading to the airport.\n\n7:07 - I call Yellow Cab to talk to a supervisor.  I'm put on hold for ten minutes.  I hang up because I'm tired of waiting.\n\n7:18 - I decide to give Yellow Cab one more chance to explain themselves.  I also expect them to pay for my parking bill at the airport which will be about $250.  The dispatcher informs me that a supervisor will not be at work until after 8:00.  So why was I not told this when I called previously?  Why was I on hold for ten minutes?\n\n8:16 - I call looking for a supervisor.  I'm given the cell phone number for someone named Rob.  I call the number and a guy named Jesus answers.  He explains that he's a supervisor for the drivers and not for dispatch.  Tells me I need to talk to someone in dispatch.\n\n8:21 - I call again looking for a supervisor.  I'm given someone's voicemail.  I leave a message and yet nobody returns my call.\n\n1:40 - I call again.  I'm placed on hold.  Yellow Cab hangs up on me after 13 minutes of being on hold.\n\n1:54 - I call again.  I inform dispatch that I will filing a law suit against Yellow Cab for the costs incurred as a result of their negligence.  I leave a name and number and suggest that someone call me back to resolve the matter.\n\nSo.... that's where we're at.  This has got to be one of the worst companies I've ever seen.  Avoid at all costs.",0
"Awful. I hate that they are the only option to take home from the airport. My ride to the airport in a different cab company was pleasant, quick, convenient, and pretty cheap. Yellow Cab's ride back from the airport the next week was awful, slow, and about $10 more than my ride there for some reason.\n\nI specifically stated when speaking to the cab manager at the airport that I had no cash and only wanted a cab equipped to take credit card. \""""No problem,\"""" he says and directs me to the first cab.

No luck. He then insisted I pay with cash since \""""it was so much easier anyways.\"""" I informed him that I had no cash and didn't want to go to an ATM with him. He begrudgingly took out an old school credit card machine at that point and spent another 10 minutes trying to figure out how to use it.\n\nTo top it all off, when looking at my bank statement, they charged me $20 more than I signed for and now I have to deal with the headache of trying to correct that.

I knew the mileage was a small difference than the route I would have gone, so I begrudgingly kept my mouth shut.

He argues that his reader is not broken but that my card was declined and he so generously discounted me three dollars. Well obviously not because I just got the cash out for him and it cost me three dollars to do so! Ugh.

The manager didn't want to talk because he was getting ready to end his day?? I have yet to hear back from them yet. I will be calling them back and disputing my charge on my credit card. It is disgusting how they just don't care. New business will come in and they won't be able to keep up.",0
Worst Cab Service ever. Ronda was the RUDEST person ever on the phone. Please someone just put them out of service already.,0
"I tried.\n\nI really tried so very hard to like you.\n\nI am thoroughly disgusted with that green car company bullshit, so I decided I was going to give you my business.\n\nI'm done. You are every bit as bad a business, perhaps even worse.\n\nThe number of times I've tried to get a cab, only to have the taxi show up, TAKE SOMEONE ELSE, then try to get another cab in a timely manner, TYPICALLY ONLY TO CALL BACK AND FIND OUT A REPLACEMENT CAB WAS NEVER SENT, is more than 5, and at least 5 more than it should be.\n\nYour dispatchers are deplorably rude, uninformed, disinterested, and generally lacking any decorum, or modicum of customer service.\n\nYour drivers are largely friendly, but equally bad at customer service, and wholly lacking any knowledge of the area.\n\nTonight was the end;\nI was at a well known eatery, THE NAME OF WHICH WAS TRANSMITTED TO THE DRIVER, PER THEIR OWN STATEMENTS, when I used the app to hail a cab.\n\nAfter an unreasonably long delay I receive a call from the driver, claiming to be \""""out front\"""". I attempted to inquire if he was in the parking lot, or on the street, but he'd already ended the call.\n\nI walk out to the parking lot, no cab.\nThere is a side entrance, right off the street, so I go around the building to that entrance, no cab.\n\nI call him back and ask his location. He says he is \""""out front\"""", to which I respond that the entrance is on the south side of the building.\n\nHe says he only sees little houses.\n\nWhat?\n\nI ask again where he is, and simultaneously walk back around the building to the street entrance, and again ask where he is.\n\nHe asks which apartment I'm in.\n\nWhat the fuck?!\n\nI ask him, was the name of the establishment transmitted with the dispatch?\n\nYes.\n\nDO YOU SEE A RESTAURANT WHERE YOU ARE AT?!\n\nNo.\n\nI tell him to honk his horn, and I hear it, so I walk INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET, and see him a couple blocks north of me.\n\nI tell him to come south, he is quite OBVIOUSLY not AT A RESTAURANT.\n\nHe tells me he was \""""just following the GPS\"""".\n\nAdditionally, I have twice tried to take advantage of the $15/airport deal, only to twice be told \""""Oh that's not the right price they just haven't updated the website\"""".\nIt says that price tonight, March 17, on the newly updated website.\n\nI could go on, but it's pointless.\n\nI'm a truck driver. I travel to many destinations I am not familiar with. But I DAMN sure know how to locate A BUSINESS NAME!!!\n\nThe ignorance of the drivers, combined with the utter indifference of the dispatchers, is too much.\n\nFuck this company.\n\nIf you need a cab, I recommend Apache. Cash only, but better than any green, or yellow options.",0
"If you decide to use Yellow Cab for a ride to the airport due to their $15 fare read carefully.\n\n*BOOK 2  HOURS AND 45 MINUTES IN ADVANCE*\n\nWhy? because it will take them a GOOD 45 minutes to arrive at your pick-up spot if they arrive at all. That way if they don't arrive (which has happen to me more than three times) you will have time to call another cab service. You would think I learned my lesson after the third time right? lol \n\nGreen (Discount Cab) and Uber never take longer than 15 mins. \n\nOh and don't say you want to pay with your card I swear they will give you the death stare and throw a hissy fit. They TRY to say their card read is broke, which it never really is. I've never had my card overcharged but I would have cash on hand if I were you. \n\nThey got 2 stars instead of 1 due to them being the only cab you can really take home from the airport because the others there are Apache taxi and yeeah no I'll pass. \n\nNo issues getting home from the airport with Yellow Cab probably because I don't live that far from the airport but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. \n\nNeedless to say I never call Yellow Cab for any rides I may need to the airport I am forced to use them for a ride home from the airport which I have no issues with.",0
Took a cab from  Sky Harbor to Old Town. The driver didn't speak English very well and tried to take me up the freeway. I told him to go up 64th he said that was the long way. He said I was wrong and he knew how to go that the freeway was the fastest. It's not it's about $10 dollars more. As we got off the 202 at Scottsdale rd. made the driver drop me at the Dennys and called Discount Cab. They saved the day.,0
"I wouldn't even give this company one star! I called for \""""immediate\"""" service! I had been in the emergency room all night sick, and was released early in the morning.. I waited an hour and a half for the cab(which by the way, never showed up!) I ended up checking back in to the emergency room because I couldn't get home to take care of myself! Thanks guys! Round of applause for you!!!\n\nWould have gone with discount cab, but their line was busy.. this explains why..",0
"This company doesn't deserve even zero star . I called from my hotel in Mesa and answered all questions . I am told taxi will be there about 20 minutes . I was in lobby more than 35 minutes and nothing !! When I called and asked , they said there is no information about me in the system and if I want taxi I should give them the information and waiting another 20 minutes . Unbelievable. ....It's shame. ..Janat",0
"Horrible rude snotty phone dispatch.\nAwful immature inconsiderate service.\n\n One star only because Yelp doesn't allow for no stars.\n\nI moved to Phoenix on Saturday Dec 13. On Sunday Dec 14, I dropped the U HAUL off and walked across the street to a pizza restaurant.  \n\nI ate and then I called Yellow cab to take me back to my new home.  The dispatch who answered was snotty, rude, and abrupt from the start.    I gave the address to him, with the cross streets.  He told me he had three different cities in the same area with that address, and asked me which one i was in.  \nI didnt know - i had to ask the restaurant - I had been in Phoenix less than 24 hours.  With a snotty, dramatic, rude tone, he said \"""" you don't know what city you're in?\""""\n When I asked him to change his tone, he told me he didn't have one - and then told me, \"""" you're the one with the tone\"""".\nI asked for his supervisor and he hung up.\nI called back.   When I asked for a supervisor, I was put on hold. \nNo one ever came to the phone.  \n\nThe manager of the restaurant heard the conversation and called Discount Cab.  Swift, polite, & friendly - they were there 10 minutes later.  On the way to my new home, they driver told me some ways to get around the area.  \n\nYellow Cab doesn't care about you, their customer.  Using them isn't a convenience for you.",0
Just took a cab ride from PHX to Tempe with cab 167. He was barely civil and drove as fast as he could for what he told us was a base fare just to get rid of us. We Ubered to the airport which was great. Will not take a cab again. Also called yellow cab to discuss after my experience and would not be given anyone to talk to. And people wonder why \u00fcber is becoming so popular.,0
"Until Horizon, I had never before hired a moving service.  I was convinced they would 1) break my stuff 2) molest my stuff and/or 3) charge a premium for breaking and molesting my stuff.  \n\nHorizon changed my attitude about the moving industry and about the ease of trusting a conscientious, hard-working local company with the valuable material aspects of my existence.  \n\nBooking the move was completely painless.  I never got that \""""what did I sign up for?\"""" feeling because I knew exactly what I was getting. The crew was dedicated and friendly.  They quickly and efficiently moved all my stuff, none of which was broken, molested, or suffered a single scratch.  This is especially impressive considering my penchant for hoarding delicate, antique lamps. \n\nI'm glad Horizon changed my mind.  It costs way more (physically, spiritually, emotionally, monetarily)  to rent a truck and do it yourself.  I'll miss the back strain and attendant excuse to lay around for days watching three seasons of Damages.  Other than that, I'm a convert.",1
"We used Horizon for a two part local move (some goods moved into a temporary apartment and most goods stored, then the apartment and stored goods moved to a new home).\n\nThey managed to damage two refrigerators and a dryer and completely ruin a washing machine.  We were eventually compensated for those losses, but we are now (after the deadline for claims is past)  finding hidden damage that was known to the moving crew but hidden from us so that they are just now being found.\n\nNeedless to say, we are disappointed.",0
"Although I moved on 12/20/13, they didn't charge my credit card until 01/04/14, even though I had called them on 12/30/13 and was told that it would be processed that day!!!!  As a result, I can't claim the charge on my 2013 taxes.  I won't be able to charge the moving expense on my 2014 taxes either since the single charge is not enough to exceed 2% of my AGI.  The move itself was fine, just the billing sucks!",0
"One star is being generous!  In 40 years, and 9 major moves, this company is the worse.  What a nightmare and I have over a dozen issues and complaints about them.  If anyone is interested in the gory details, just shoot me a private message and I will share them with you.",0
"Well, here it is -- July 27th and they still are slow rolling me on my insurance claim.  What a crappy company.",0
"Initially, I had a great experience with this company.  My contact person was friendly, explained the process, and was quick to get me a quote.  The movers who moved me out of my house were friendly and efficient.  However, once I actually got moved out of my house, things went downhill.  My belongings arrived 5 days after the 10 day window they provided me.  I would call to ask where my belongings were, only to be told they couldn't reach the driver.  \n\nThen, when I arrived to meet the driver, he was in a screaming match with the manager of my storage facility.  He was rude the entire time.  He was swearing, rude, and almost got my kicked out. Three weeks after my move, the driver who insisted that I had all of my boxes when I had several that were not checked off (he said he remembered moving them in and I must not have heard him call at the number), called to tell me he had several items of mine on his truck, including my mother's wedding dress.  \n\nThe week after my belongings arrived, they told me I still owed $47 because I moved into a storage facility instead of a house, despite the fact that I told them from day one that I was moving into storage.  My contact at the company admitted it was her mistake for not including that in the quote and said she would get the charge removed. I heard nothing for weeks and assumed it was taken care of.  Then, I got a bill sent to my employer asking for payment of this fee.  I wrote back to the company explaining why I wasn't paying, and assumed this was the end of it, as I never heard back.    \n\nNow, over a month after my move, after I received an invoice saying all was paid except for the ridiculous fee I was fighting, my employer was sent a bill saying that no portion of the cost had been paid.  When I called to ask why, I was told the billing department couldn't answer that question without calling the people who directly handled my move but that nothing had been paid... despite the invoice I had from two weeks earlier saying I had paid and the charge for nearly $3000 that I paid off on my credit card last month!  \n\nWhen I started this move, I thought I would use the company again when I move into my house.  However, first impressions were definitely wrong, and I would never work with them again.  It would seem that they are trying to double bill myself and my employer (we split the cost of the move), and no one seems to know what is happening.",0
"Like another reviewer here, I was very excited to try this place out. I travel to Phoenix several times a year and I always saw the place on my way to the rental car return. There are always lots of cars going through and while I waited for my order I noticed tons of cars rolling through. These are usually good signs for an eating establishment.\n\nImagine my disappointment when I realized that folks in Phoenix don't know what fish and chips are. I was expecting real fish and chips, not some odd square facsimile of fish. Fish filets are NOT square. If i had wanted this I could have just gone to Long J. Silvers or Captian D's. I'm not saying I'm a fish and chips aficionado but I've eaten fish and chips all over the country and this is NOT fish and chips. Go have some fish and chips in New England (anywhere in NE) and you'll find out what fish and chips should be.\n\n I'll admit that the sauce is good and if I had some real fish and chips to dip it in, I'd enjoy it even more. I can only chalk this up to a regional thing but I'll definitely give this place a pass the next time I'm in Phoenix.",0
Buyer Beware!!!!!!!,0
"The problem with this place is that MOST, not all but MOST, of their produce comes from loads that are refused by places like Fry's and Safeway. I'm sure the veggie trays another user talked about were refused from Walmart or somewhere. That's why I use CSA over Bountiful Baskets. But they do have some deals if you don't mind 2nd hand produce. Like I said not everything is refused produce...",0
"We really liked the parillada that I ended up sharing with two other people. It comes in a half or full size. We got to pick three meats  with the full size and chose the  chicken,pastor and carne asada. We could have also picked lengua,beef Head and another meat i can't remember. I am not usually a big fan of pastor but this pastor changed my mind, it was very tasty. The chicken was really delicious and the carne asada was on point too. We had the choice of corn or flour tortillas and the platter also had several grilled vegetables piled on top- green onion, tomato and Guerito Chiles. They also gave us a plate with fresh cucumber, red onion and a bowl of guacamole. \n\nThe three of us ate for $25 (including drinks) and even had to take food home because we could not finish the full size platter. Very good value and plenty of food. \n\nI would have given them five stars if they had more salsa choices, I personally love a good Salsa de Molcajete and that would have been a perfect compliment as it is a roasted type salsa. Their salsa was just basic and nothing to write home about. \n\nAlso, it is very loud in the restaurant and hard to hear. So, we kept our mouths full with good food and kept the talking to a minimum since it was hard to hear. LOL\n\nAsadero is on the southwest corner of Monroe and 16th St and the parking is a tight fit and very limited. However,  there is an empty parking lot on the other side of Monroe on the northwest side of 16th street that we parked at (as did several other families) and walked the short distance across the street. The only bad part about parking there was coming out after dark and seeing a suspicious guy lurking over in that lot. His body language implied he was up to no good, so be careful if you park over there because that parking lot is not lit at all and as overgrown bushes and trees with a low wall surrounding it making several places to hide behind. \n\nI am from Los Angeles and to go out to get some decent ethnic foods, you have to go to certain neighborhoods that sometimes are questionable. When doing so, you must be vigilant while in those type areas.  I felt I was back there coming out of the restaurant so,  I was  already very vigilant coming out and spotted the guy right away before we walked over there.We had our guy friend drive from the restaurant lot to the one across the street and the creeper guy got spooked and took off. \n\nWe will go back for sure and will be a place to stop when we are in the area!",1
"Based on reviews I thought the food would be excellent both in flavor and quality. We had carne asada tacos and there was almost no flavor at all. Plus, two of the tacos had big pieces of gristle that were unedible.",0
"Boom! my old favorite mexican food place closed awhile back, but this place easily takes my favorites list by storm.\n\nHad the torta pastor and pollo asado burro. Both very delicious. Don't worry i didn't eat both...that would be horrifying. Servings are huge, the place smells EMACULATE! (what you expect an Asadero to smell like). I loved walking in there and getting the most beautiful aroma of bbq'd meat. MMMM\n\nwould I go. Yes! the trick is going when they are actually opened. I totally lucked out on this instance. I've only seen it open 3 times and I've drive past 100's of times. maybe i have bad timing. Anyways definitely note worthy on Phoenix's authentic mexican foods to try.",1
"Pros - This place is so good! We always get the platter with 3 meats.\n           The ribs are so delicious too, they are my favorite thing on the menu!\n\nCons - They have only one salsa, which isn't that good and you come out smelling               like burn from all the smoke in the air.",1
"If you like hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurants that serve mind blowing amazing food, then you'll love this place. This place is the real deal. I'll be back!",1
"I wish I possessed the power to delete this place from Yelp and keep it secret. since I cant , I will share.\n\nOthers have said essentially disregard the visuals with this place. Fact. it is in the 'hood, has a downscale exterior appearance, limited parking, and a colorful human element circulating on the street adjacent to the area. Nothing dangerous, just colorful. \n\nJust park your sled and go inside.\n\nThe interior consists of a single room  of ~30'x20' with perhaps a total of ten 4-top picnic table/bench style tables. \n\nWait staff brings menus. The fare is simple - flame singed animal protein ferried to your table on a small  sterno fired BBQ  contraption about the same size of a 12pack of soda cans.\n\nWe ordered a beef, pork and chicken paradilla, termed a half order. For $13,it arrives with tortillas, salsa,  lime wedges, and onion on the BBQ contraption which I surmise is a parradilla.\n\nThis meal would be a contender for my last meal if I were on death row. Perfect. Super tasty. Smple. Excellent value.\nFree people watching. What more can a carbon life form hope for?\n\n$19.36, with tax,before tip, for a sizeable pile of meat, a giant horchata and a giant soda.\n\nIf you want enchiladas, albondigas or a taco salad look elsewhere.\n\nThis joint does one thing, and one thing only, very well.\n\nMy ONLY complaint would be the tortillas and tortilla chips could be a bit better quality \nbut things are actually fine as they are.\n\nI hope the folks get rich and stay in business for many years to come.\n\nGo, disregard the optics of the place, enjoy, and thank us band of swarthy reviewers\n for convincing you to give this gem a shot.",1
"After you eat here, just once, you'll be wrecked on eating tacos anywhere else in Phoenix.   Take 3 friends, and order the \""""special\"""" where they bring a char-broiler to your table with 3 different kinds of meats.  Like $24.   Order guacamole.   It's actually guacamole, not mush.  The salsa is fantastic.   Kind of a rough neighborhood, but close enough to downtown you'll be fine.  Brush up on your Espanol and be prepared for some of the best eating you've ever done.",1
This was not great. Not even good. Just ok. The meat is very hard. I just expected more based on the reviews. Meh,0
"It's all relative. If this place was back home in SF, I'd probably give it 5 stars.  But in a city full of excellent, cheap Sonoran joints, this one rates 'very good' in my estimation.\n\nI tried the chicken burro on a recommendation thinking it would be one of those dinky little burros I usually get here in Phoenix. But this was a full-sized affair; not Mission burrito big but enough to make a meal out of. \n\nNot knowing that, I also ordered a couple of tacos. The carne asada wasn't as flavorful as the best I've had, the old original America's Taco Shop on 7th. The barbacoa was lovely. \n\nTheir chips reminded me of Fritos but the red hot sauce and little cup of frijoles a la charra were outstanding. So was the guacamole that accompanied my tacos. \n\nNext time I come here, I'm going to get the 1/4 chicken like just about everyone else in the place was eating.",1
"This place is much like any place you'll walk in all through Mexico and Central America - I need places like this whenever I get sick with wanderlust.\n\nOrder the whole chicken and some carne asada tacos.  The food is amazing, their salsa is top notch, and they REALLY know how to cook up some carne asada.  You'll be coming back for more!",1
Straight up best Mexican food I've ever had. amazing food. I got the Diced Steak signature plate thing....Comes with 6 small taco shells. It's so friggin good. Just do it.,1
The security guard at night called me a racist name. I was a long term guest at this place waiting for my house to finish and the management there seemed racist and judgmental towards young pretty single females. I would never recommend anyone to rent from here because of the current manager in charge and the racist security guard that totally disrespected me. I spent a lot of money to stay here and I was disgusted by the treatment I received in return.,0

"On a recommendation from a friend, I parked my car here for 3 days during a short trip.  I parked in the covered parking area thinking I'd protect my car.  However, it rained while I was gone and when I returned my car had water spots all over it.....so much for covered parking.\n\nThe good news is that it was only $11 per day and I signed up for their frequent parking card that will allow me to earn a free day for every 5 days I park....cool.\n\nThe shuttle to/from the airport is very convenient and the drivers are friendly and helpful.  They will pick you up at your car and drop you off at your car when you return.....that's pretty good service.  I like this place even though my car wasn't really covered.\n\nReturn Factor - 97%",1
"Remembered that I liked PreFlight, but had a bad experience this time.  We pulled in, parked in a covered spot, waited for the shuttle, then watched a shuttle driver make eye contact with us, then drive away!  We wandered up to the entrance kiosk, and was met by another driver who claimed that he was the one who was supposed to pick us up... well, then why did I have to go over there to pick him up?  Anyway, I'm going back to BlueSky next time.  Closer to Tucson, and they actually pick you up from your car!",0
I recommend this place without reservation. The only place we park when we travel.\nFriendly employees.,1
"They really make travel easy.  Not only is it cheaper to park at Pre-Flight than to park at the airport, it is also more convenient.  When you arrive, they give you a section to park in.  Within a matter of minutes a van picks you up from you car and a friendly drive loads your luggage into the van.  When you arrive at the airport, the same friendly driver take care of your bags again.  Upon returning, you go to the designated curb and a van is never more than 10 minutes away.  They take you right to your car and will even load your luggage into your trunk.\n\nExcellent service!",1
"When I travel and need to leave my car parked somewhere, I choose to use PreFlight.  Since my last review over 2 yrs ago, I've continued to use this service.  It's located a short distance from the airport, but it's significantly cheaper than parking at the airport, so you can save some money.  They also have coupons available which add to the savings.\n\nI'm glad a friend referred me to this place early on.  Since then, I've recommended it to many friends and associates.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",1
"I agree with the other reviews. This place is cheaper than all the others. But I think that reflects on their customer service. \nI had made a reservation online about a month in advance. And when I arrived to park, they told me that there were no spots available, and could they valet my car. Fine. As long as I don't pay extra and I can park my car. \n\nHowever when I returned to town and was given my keys, I noticed that my car was unlocked. I was a little worried.. I tried to start my car. No luck. I tried to lock my car. Nothing. \nAnd on top of that, I noticed that I know have little scratches on my drivers side door. \n\nI noticed that an employee had moved my car (since it had to be valeted even though I didn't order that), and that they had left the dome light on, thus killing the battery, the car alarm, and my keys. It was upsetting. Thank goodness I had a battery operated jump starter since no one was around to help me sort this out. \n\nAfter my trip, I received an email asking how the service was. I let them know what happened, but no on responded to my complaints. I am appalled by the lack of respect for the customer. \n\nI will never park there again. I will not recommend this place. \nI would rather pay extra to ensure that my car will be taken care of properly.",0
"My favorite place to park as they have great rates, fast pick up and free bottled water. They offer covered parking and car washes as well which I have not utilized.",1
"We have been using PreFlight for several years now for both business and personal trips. Their customer service is top notch. They are always there to pick us up in a heartbeat, handle all our luggage and are very pleasant. Last night we flew in after a 4+ hour flight and my car battery was dead. The driver called for help right away and within 3 minutes we were on our way! The gal that brought the jumpers even brought us each a bottle of water. The trip before that I had completely misplaced my ticket to get out. I showed them my rental car receipt and told them what time I arrived and there were no hassles whatsoever! Also nice that you can either prebook and pay online before your trip (very nice when you are on vacation to know this is already paid for when you get home) or print coupons (which are consistent) to use on your way out. A+ PreFlight! You are the best!",1
"You get what you pay for.  If you park here make sure you talk to the person at the front window.  We came in and pushed the button and got our little ticket and then went and parked.  After waiting for a few minutes in the 105 degree Arizona sun at noon we just started walking towards the front.  A driver saw us and picked us up.  Didn't offer to take our bags or apologize for the fact we were walking.  Just told us next time to talk to the girl at the window (who we assumed was there just to take money for the people leaving.  \n\nThe driver didn't ask which airline we were flying nor did he grab out bags on the way in or out.  No biggie for me, but he should at least get out of his chair and offer to get my girlfriends bag.\n\nYou get what you pay for.  I guess I'll go back to the slightly more expensive covered lot down the road a bit :/",0
"An absolute LIFESAVER!   SONNY THE MANAGER ON DUTY......A plus customer service!  I made the mistake of choosing the lowest cost offsite parking on the Howard Johnson property...MISTAKE!  I will be lucky if my car is there when I return.  The shuttle wasn't coming for another 25 minutes and I'm gonna miss my flight.  Im sure the HJ manager meant well but he tells me if I walk across the street and through a parking lot I can catch the train.....mistake #2.  I'm sweating my butt off fast walking now down 44th st with luggage.  The manager Sonny at preflight brings me an ice cold bottle of water and grabs one of his drivers and gets me to the airport......he says \""""park with us next time\""""  \nThank you Sonny and I absolutely will.  That was very very nice what you did.",1
"This was a great service for my wife and I when going to Hawaii for a week.  We live on the west side, so we thought we would schedule a shuttle.  After researching it, pre-flight was a couple of dollars cheaper and we maintained the convenience of our own car.  They got us in quickly, picked us up at our car quickly, and delivered us to the airport quickly.  Our return was just as smooth if not smoother.  I had misplaced the email I needed to get out of the parking lot, but they went in and found my reservation for me and we were on our way home.  Would recommend to anyone!!!",1
Great location and cost effective. The drivers are professional.  It's so much cheaper and faster than parking in the economy lot and riding the tram!,1
"I always use PreFlight for my airport parking.  They are fast and reliable with safe facilities - in the shade or not, your choice.",1
"I have parked exclusively at Preflight for more than 8 years, nearly every week.  the stays have normally been 3 to 4 days, but as long as 2 weeks.  there's a speed pass option to avoid the pay window on exit, and auto-pay, allng eigh a great frequent parker program.   Juan, Steve, Julio and Eddie are favorites, but every one if them have been fast, friendly and professional.   thanks @preflightphx",1
"I just stopped by Hap's to pick up some ribs and chicken for the first NFL game of the year. I have eaten here once before and forgot the great smoked taste that all of their meats have. \n\nI would compare it to something like a Shane's Barbecue, not really a hole in the wall type barbecue spot but definitely small and very clean. I think the meat has a much better taste than Shane's, more of a smoked taste rather than relying on the sauce for the taste. \n\nI would say this is more of a pick-up type place and for sure a place to get some family sized meals for a small party or during a game.",1
"Went here for lunch with a co-worker.  We both had the combo sandwiches (half pulled pork, half pulled chicken)  I like the potato salad as the spices in it were good.  My co-worker enjoyed the broccoli casserole.  Good portions at a fair price.",1
"I stopped in here for lunch, and I have to say, I don't know what the fuss is about.\n\nFirst of all, it's fast food, so to say this is better than Famous Dave's or  Joe's is a little absurd.  It is a fast food restaurant, and the food is fast food quality.  Some of the other reviews unfortunately led me to believe this would be on a par with some of the other great BBQ joints around.\n\nI had the pulled pork sandwich, with mashed potatoes and garlic toast on the side.  The sandwich itself was fine, although as one other reviewer mentioned, it was a little bland.  The meat was also not piled particularly high, as evidenced by its failure to fall out of the sandwich and onto the foil wrapper.\n\nThe garlic toast was not really garlic toast.  It was more like a toasted sandwich bun with butter and a little bit of garlic salt.  There was not fresh garlic on it, nor did it even taste like garlic.  Very disappointing.\n\nThe mashed potatoes were even worse.  I ate less than half; there was no flavor (maybe throw a little garlic in there?), and the texture was more pasty than soft and fluffy.  After the first bite, I took a few more out of obligation, and set it aside.\n\nI did like to see the lamb on the menu.  I will definitely be back to give it a try.  But the most spectacular part of my meal was the bottled root beer, and that should never happen when you go to eat BBQ.  It seems like they just generally have an inexplicable fear of garlic.  Maybe they're vampires?\n\n2.5 stars.  At least it's better than Honey Bear's.",0
"I've tried several of the bbq joints in the valley and Haps by far is a cut above the others. Had the sampler the other day and it was awesome! Brisket was nice and tender, the ribs peeled right off the bone, the pulled pork melted in my mouth, the chicken was delicious, and the lamb left me wanting more. And, I don't even like lamb all that much. I chose baked beans for the side and they didn't disapoint. I will definitely go back to Haps for an encore.",1
"Since my previous review last year, I've eaten at Haps quite a few more times.  After lunch today (a coworker insisted we go there), I think it's finally time to reduce this to one star.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, in short, it's because they cut every corner they can find.  I've already mentioned the terrible side dishes.  The flavorless mashed potatoes, the garlic-less garlic toast, etc.  The buns they use are terrible; it's dry, spongy, and completely flavorless.  The scoop of ice cream they put on top of the cobbler (which they charge you about $1.50 for) is that yellow garbage you get in those five gallon buckets labeled \""""frozen dairy dessert product.\""""\n\nAnd perhaps most indicative of their overall cheapness, they replaced the Henry Weinhard's root beer with that plastic bottled A&W crap some time last year.  Yes, I can tell the difference, and yes, that move alone cost them my business.\n\nFor the record, my lunch today (a pulled pork sandwich, a cup of cobbler with a scoop of ice cream, and a cup of water) cost me almost $12.  With a drink, that would have been $14.  For low quality food, those prices are unacceptable.\n\nI guess people in Arizona like this garbage.  If someone tells you this place has good food, you can rest assured they either have no taste buds or actually like bad food.",0
Potato salad not good at all. Beans not good at all. Ribs were really pink and when its pork I rather be safe than sorry. U ordered garlic bread and that was a joke ! How can u mess up garlic bread cmon guys ! Youll never see me there again but u can catch at honey bears tho !,0
"One star for their great service. Food was the worst BBQ ever, horrible, ribs were rare?  Yes pink stuck to the bone not done, threw them away.   Expensive and horrible food.",0
"When I first reviewed this place, I think I was at a loss for good southern BBQ.  Now that I've eaten at Haps a few times, I've noticed a few of the annoying things they do with their food. First, when you come to Haps, you never smell smoking meat, which makes me wonder if they smoke their own BBQ, or they buy it precooked from a distributor.  I've seen them use the microwave to heat their baked beans and their pulled pork, which makes me think they don't cook the BBQ in house.  Their food is certainly better than fast food, but maybe not as good as some other BBQ places in the Valley",0
Hap's is in an area of town that doesn't have that many healthy lunch options.  I get the 1/4 Chicken Only (No Sides) 2 Piece-White (Breast and Wing.) Sauce on the side.  The breast is a nice piece of smoked meat that they put on the grill for a minute to heat up when served.  Discard the skin and enjoy only the end chunk off the wing and you've got a pretty good high-protein lunch for under $4 for the paleo-diet oriented crowd.,1
"Every spring we spend two weeks in Phoenix for spring training.  Each year we go to Haps several times for a quick lunch.  We stick with the sandwiches - pulled pork, brisket, chicken, or ham.  They are all very good.  The sauce is excellent but they never give us enough so we order more.  My family loves the slaw (uhgg).  The other sides are OKayish but not on par with the BBQ. The best part is the hot peach cobbler for dessert.  The prices are adequate.  The location is near a lot of things or at least en-route.  The staff is efficient and friendly. \n\nAs for the BBQ:  The meat is smoked and cooked with a rub not in the sauce.  Some people like this but I prefer my BBQ to be cooked in or basted with the sauce.  The BBQ sauce is served more as a condiment/topping or dip.  The sauce is bold like a Texas BBQ with some hints of sweetness of KC style.\n\nIn short, we will go to Haps again and again.  We will and have recommended this eatery to family and close friends.",1
"I went to Hap's for the first time today.  I work down the street and everyone told me the BBQ was pretty good.  I believed them because it's not that hard to put a good rub on a piece of meat and let it smoke.  I went because I heard they actually serve smoked salmon (which I love).  So I ordered the smoked salmon wrap, a side of coleslaw and a drink.  Total $10!  I know BBQ is a craft and I understand the pricing but I was expecting some great pieces of smoke salmon in a wrap with some nice spinach, other veggies and maybe some kind of dressing.  What I got was a puree of something that resembled salmon mixed with mayonnaise and something else wrapped up in the tiniest flour tortilla.  It was a little bigger than a twinkie.  The coleslaw was a good size and texture but lacked flavor.  They might serve good BBQ but from what I saw, the portions were really small.  Based on my experience today I will not be going back to their restaurant.",0
"Absolutely average at best. Service is pretty slow and the pork sandwich I had was very greasy. Restaurant was clean except the gang banging graffiti in the restroom. \n\nPulled pork was ok, IMHO I believe no sauce should be put on your sandwich. Should always be on the side so we know you're not hiding anything with sauce, but as I said earlier, greasy. \n\nSingle rib was just ok too. Obviously they do not take the time to remove the membrane from the back side. Pretty important to me. No combustion ring either. I think they may be cheating some way. Ive never smoked ribs, or anything else for that matter, that didn't have a ring when done. \n\nPotato salad tasted old and a bit over peppered.",0
"First time at Hap's for lunch today. Arrived at 11:20 on a Wednesday and it was empty-a little auspicious. More came after I ordered, so I was relieved. \n\n Ordered a combo with pulled pork, hot link, cole slaw and choice of chips. It also came with a small side of BBQ sauce. \n\nThe pulled pork was good. Nice flavor but didn't get much smoke flavor-don't know what wood they use. The hot link was disappointing. No 'snap' at all and next to zero flavor. Too bad. The slaw was very forgettable. It was absolutely drenched in mayonnaise and I couldn't taste the cabbage at all. I will try potato salad next time. They offer Dirty Potato Chips brand chips, which is a good choice. I got the jalape\u00f1o chips. \n\nI will try Hap's again but will avoid the hot link and slaw.",1
"Terrible & WAY over priced!\n\nI had the pulled pork sandwich with slaw & garlic bread for a side.\n\nThe pork was ok by its self for smoked pork. As a pulled pork sandwich though, it was awful. The bbq sauce they put on it was store bought. The pork was dry & not well separated. The bun was SO bad. It was hard & tasted dry even with sauce. \n\nThe \""""garlic \""""\""""bread\""""\"""" was a cheap hamburger bun slathered in cheap garlic butter, then burned on one side which got soggy in the foil wrapper they serve it in. I would have got my money back on it, but I had a couple bites & just left. \n\nThe tables were dirty too.",0
"So.. Being a BBQ Chef and all around BBQ snob, I thought I would check this place out.  I can at least say I've tried it.  \n\nPulled pork: tasted like they just thawed it out after running to the grocery store and buying pre made.\n\nBrisket: smoke ring?? Nothing.  Very dry.\n\nRibs: now the ribs I can get behind.  Very juicy and tender.  They didn't fall off the bone when you looked at them but they also didn't have to be tugged on by your teeth.  \n\nTake it or leave it, but this is just my opinion.",0
"I had been looking forward to trying this place out for awhile.  However, I shouldn't have.  \n\nI ordered the brisket and pulled pork dinner and it came with a side, so I ordered mashed potatoes.  The meat was below average and didn't taste fresh.  The mashed potatoes were not good either.  The dinner roll that is used to put the meat on for the pulled pork was the only thing that was decent.  I did not care for the bbq sauce. I ordered the cherry cobbler but thew it out after one bite.\n\nI do NOT recommend this restaurant.  If you want good bbq, go to Little Miss BBQ!",0
The pulled pork is ok. The ribs are crap. The sauce is good but very sweet. The soda is watered down. But the biggest problem is that it is waaaaaayyyyyyy overpriced. With so many good BBQ options around the valley this is a place you should skip.,0
"I had the lamb special BBQ sandwich - it was good: moist - tasty. Just a perfect lunch sandwich.\n\nThe place is small but very clean, and looks well cared for.\n\nDefinitely will be back on my nxt phx trip.",1
"Beware after 5\n\nI have stopped by here on the way home several times.  Food always seems microwave heated.  It's ok but not great.  Stopped in today and ordered a cheese burger.  This sandwich had exactly meat, cheese (extra .80 cents) and bun.  No lettuce no tomato.  I did decline the mayo mustard and got a little BBQ sauce.  Overall the burger was tired - looking like an am/pm burger.  Not worth the time or money to pick it up at all.\n\nAnother time I ordered a beef brisket dinner and got home to find they had not included BBQ sauce - what BBQ place forgets the BBQ sauce?\n\nI've had lunch here and it was really good.  It seems like the problems are always after 5.",0
"Not was I was hoping for.  Tried the pulled pork sandwich,  rib tips,  and potato salad.  Everything was swimming  in an overly sweet sauce.  Pulled pork was soggy and I couldn't even tell if it had a smokey flavor because of the sauce. I won't comment too much on the rib tips because I'd never had rib  tips before,  so not much to compare it to. I will say that they were basically in sauce soup. Potato salad was tasty but nothing special  really  (not that it has to be). \n\nMy biggest qualm was the rudeness of the woman working the counter.  If you can manage a fake smile you shouldn't be in a customer service job. I literally sat at the counter and just started at her waiting for her to acknowledge me verbally, rather than just starting impatiently at me. The guy who ran the food was nice, but that lady is a nightmare of a person.",0
"I travel across the country on a weekly basis, and eating barbecue is what gets me through the days. I have eaten at every good barbecue spot from Kansas City to North Carolina and not once have I come close to the greatness that I experienced today in this joint and I live right here in Phoenix.\n\nI got the sampler and it was worth every penny!  I've never experienced a more flavorful, juicy, meaty rib in all of my travels! The pulled pork was so tender with just the right amount of smokiness....mmmmm. I've never had smoked lamb, but will dream about it from this day forward. They make a minty sweet sauce to go along with it and it is a real treat!\n\nI give this family five thumbs up for starting this place and serving the best 'que of all time!",1
"Arizona Science Center  deserves better.  The \"""" Cafe\"""" doesn't serve coffee or tea.  What a silly joke if it weren't so sad!

"The D\u00eda de los Muertos event at the Desert Botanical Garden (DBG) was fantastic this year; however, the food catered by this company was certainly not \""""fabulous.\"""" The food was average at best and certainly overpriced for the quality. \n\nThe catered menu for the DBG celebration consisted of a fairly limited menu of chips & salsa, and a choice of either Machaca Tacos (shredded beef) or Fish Tacos. There may have been one salad option, too. \n\nThe chips were fresh and the salsa was delicious, but seemed a little overpriced at $4.50 for a small serving. The Machaca Taco plate came with a side of rice and refried black beans for $13.95. The shredded beef was tender and had good flavor, but the rice was cold and the refried beans were dried out and lacking flavor. Also, the Horchata tasted like sweet milk and was seriously lacking in spice - who forgot the cinnamon?! \n\nBesides the lackluster food, I was also disappointed by the lack of professionalism and attitude of the catering crew. This was a cool event to cater, but they all looked bored. \n\nBased on this experience trying a meal catered by FF and interacting with their staff, I would not hire them in the future.",0
"After getting shuttled to the middle of nowhere at 9pm, I had to wait in line for another hour before I even got to talk to an \""""agent.\""""  There were not a lot of people waiting, it was just that 3 counter people were doing absolutely nothing.  Nobody told us anything, which would have helped, as we waited for another hour for some cars to get brought up.  Finally, I was jokingly offered a 12 passenger van because they did not have enough cars.  Since I was tired of waiting I decided to take it.  At the last minute they managed to find me a normal car.  When I got to the garage, there were dozens of cars available and four people just sitting around in a booth!?  I have no idea how this company has managed to stay in business with people like this working for them.  AVOID!",0
"It was strange, I had read a review with regards to Budget today.  I had the same experience with a pre-paid agreement through Hotwire.com.  I used Hotwire to bid and pay for the car in advance (approximately $130.00).  The agent turned around and recharged me the amount plus an upgrade fee of about $40.00.  I was pissed off.  Furthermore, they would not help me with the child's seat in the car.\n\nI did manage to contact me credit card company to have the charges reversed and was successful.  Budget did not relent.  They wanted to recharge me the car rental plus an upgrade.\n\nNever again!",0
"Nightmare! Rented from this facility through Priceline for a fair price...$136 for one week. When I realized my car would not be fixed within the specified time, I called a day later and told them....they said not a problem, keep it as long as necessary. I ended up at the end of a 18 day period with a $2,218.00 bill; which I am still disputing. Even though the agent TOLD me my daily rate was $23 a day for every day over, I did not READ the fine print stating it was actually $90; not what she SAID. Thank GOD, for American Express who is helping me fight this issue. No one in their right mind would pay $90 a day for a compact car. They are a shady car company who is loosing their ground to companies like Alamo and Hertz, so take advantage of consumers who don't bother to read the fine print when renting through Hotwire and Priceline. Completely fraudulant.",0
"Great experience overall.  I reserved the car through their website prior to my trip.  Once I arrived I rode the rental car shuttle to the large building with all other rental places.\n\nThe one downside was that I stood in line for 45 minutes to get my car.  They had 5 people working behind the counter and we moving as fast as they could.  If you use them make sure to sign up for Fast Break and you get to skip the line and go straight to your car.\n\nThe car was what I ordered. Simple to pick up. Friendly counter service.  Dropping off was painless and quick too.  I had no issues at all.  I choose my rentals mainly based on price, so I'm sure I'll use Budget again at some point, but I would not choose them over a cheaper competitor. They were good, but not anything above and beyond the expected.",1
The telephone agent offered a 25% discount and said we had to wait to get the credit upon return.  After waiting in the longest line ever to get a car the clerk told discount was told we only had the 5% AAA.  They said we could check with them upon return and maybe someone could do something.   Upon return they made us wait forever while the guy called someone who finally said they could do nothing and did not know anything about it.   Seems like we're not the only ones and that this might be a scam by some third party phone sales agents trying to meet a quota or something.  Budget as a national brand should be ashamed of putting a damper on what was a great Spring Training weekend.\n\nNever will do business with Budget again and will tell all my friends.,0
"Be very careful! Our trip package included a three day rental at Budget. We decided to opt for insurance as one person driving was not insured. Quoted $50/day for the insurance. Then we were \""""upgraded\"""" to a midsize car for \""""only $10 more.\"""" When I objected to the ugly old GPS they forced us to take since we already had a new GPS, I was told, \""""You HAVE to take it. It is included with the package.\"""" So you think, an extra $180 isn't great but doable. Then you get your credit card bill which is a whopping $320. \n\nWhen I called to complain, they said that there was a $45 charge for the GPS and $15 for roadside service and a completely insane (like 40%) tax rate. And that I should have declined it if I didn't want it. (Believe me, I tried--they just kept insisting it was included.)\n\nMy advice--decline everything when renting a car from this company. Or renting a car in Phoenix period.",0
"I rented a car for 10 days from Budget. My experience once I got TO the Budget desk was great, but the circus you have to go through to get your rental car is crazy!!! I spent more time at the airport and rental car complex than I did on my flight!! \n\nFirst you have to go catch a rental car shuttle which has you dodging cars zooming in and out of the pick-up area right outside of baggage claim. Then this shuttle takes you to the new multi-million dollar Rental Car \""""complex\"""" which is NOT located at the airport, but about 10 minutes outside of the airport. At first I thought \""""how absurd\"""", but now that I think about it, it's a great idea because it cuts WAY down on the traffic that goes in and out of Phoenix International Airport. \n\nBut...they DO pass this \""""Rental Car Complex\"""" cost on to you in the form of an additional \""""fee\"""" added to your rental car contract. Mine was $72. Not sure how much it is for shorter rentals, but everyone at EVERY rental car place HAS to pay it regardless. \n\nThe line at Budget was not too bad...about 5 of us. But it took 20 minutes for me to finally get up to an agent. They only had 2 agents working so maybe that is why. My agent was very nice but he kept trying to offer me a bunch of extras and upgrades. One of my favorites was the \""""If you get the bigger car the AC blows better! In the car you have now, the AC isn't as good\"""". I declined and did just fine with the AC in the small car. \n\nAfter I got my car I went over it with a fine toothed comb and documented all of the scratches, dents, repair marks, etc... Well, the elderly gentleman at the check-out booth was not thrilled with this as he had to fill out a form documenting it all. I apologized and told him it was nothing against him, it was just me being safe. He understood but told me not to worry about \""""every little ding\"""". \n\nCar rental return was EXCELLENT!! Fastest return I've ever had, ever!! You just pull up, the girl looks over it real fast, hands you your receipt, and you are on your way! Just head straight for the shuttle pick-up area. No returning back to the rental desk. \n\nNOTE: Make sure you get on the RIGHT shuttle bus for your airline terminal. A few people got on my bus for terminal 4 when they thought they could also get to the other terminals. They had to ride the shuttle all the way back to the rental car complex to get on the right shuttle for their terminal.",1
"Budget is the KING of HIDDEN FEES!!!\n\nI initially made my reservation over the phone, asking the Budget \""""nationwide sales\"""" call center how much it costs to rent an \""""Economy\"""" car for 7 days.  The lady quoted around $240 or $245.  I then told her that their Budget listing on the Southwest Airlines Web site showed a smaller daily fee, and she lowered it to $217 for 7 days, which I agreed to.  Before I hung up, I asked several times if this \""""$217\"""" was the total that would be billed to my credit card or if taxes and various other fees would be added on.  The lady at the Budget call center said that was the total, with taxes everything included.\n\nWhen I actually showed up at the Phoenix Sky Harbor rental window for Budget and gave them my reservation confirmation number, the printout showed a total of $271.   My first thought was \""""WTF!!??!?!\""""   I told the tight-lipped guy at the Budget rental counter that I was quoted $217, but then all he did was to point out on the printout all of the this-and-that fees added on.  I had declined all other rental options such as other insurance, fuel service, GPS, etc, etc.  After griping at the guy and crying \""""Foul\"""" for 15 minutes, I ended up renting the car... it was 11:40PM and I was too tired to go shopping at the other car rental companies. \n\nSeven days later, I fueled up the rental car in the early afternoon, drove around Scottsdale to run some errands and returned the car later in the afternoon.  The fuel gauge was still about near the full mark.  But when I turned the car in, the guy turned on the ignition, and added about $34 to my $271 bill for a total of $305.  This was for an Economy car that was originally reserved for $217!!!   The Budget idiot said that the gas tank was not totally full and billed me extra at the rate of $8 per gallon, or adding on another 4 gallons to my bill.  With that small rental car, there was NO WAY that I drove 100+ miles during the few hours that I had the car in Scottsdale!!!!\n\nBUDGET IS A BUNCH OF BAIT-AND-SWITCH CROOKS!!!!!!!\n\nOn the Budget Web site http://www.budget.com/budgetWeb/html/en/customer/commonquestions/index.html  , they give the alibi to justify a $8/gallon fuel charge of:\n\nWhy do you charge so much to refuel the car? \nAnswer:  Unless a customer has chosen the Fuel Service Option, which is competitive with local gas prices, we prefer that renters stop at a local station and refuel the car before returning it. If the customer chooses not to do so, we charge a premium for providing this refueling service to them. That charge takes into account both direct and indirect costs of having to refuel and maintain our refueling infrastructure for customers who prefer this service. The charge also is intended to strongly motivate customers to save by refueling the car themselves. \n\n\nBut that BS is just a veil to prevent Budget from getting sued even more.    Budget has a long history of infractions and penalties imposed by the Federal Trade Commission:\n\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/opa/2007/11/budget.shtm\n\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/0623042/index.shtm\n\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/opa/1996/03/budget.shtm\n\nAnd Budget has been very unethical with their sneaky handling of fuel charges, imposing damage fees, and sneaking other fees to screw their customers as much as possible. \n\nI did not uncover all of this Budget shit until my $217 rental experience turned into $305.  But I guess that I learned my lesson to NEVER RENT FROM BUDGET AGAIN.  Maybe misery loves company, but there are other accounts from people who had their Budget bill inflate from $300 to more than $600.\n\nAnd if you complain about the bill, either to Budget personnel on the phone or to the car inspector or rental counter person at Sky Harbor, they are all assholes who treat you like shit once they know that they have your credit card number tied up with a rental.",0
"This review probably speaks more to the gouging of tourist in the Phoenix area than anything else. First things first the budget staff were helpful and got me my cars pretty quickly. Firstly, getting to and from the facility is an ordeal. Best bet it is 15 minutes each way to get to the rental facility for this place. At worst I waited 10 minutes for the bus then 30 minutes to get to the terminal on the bus (traffic for some reason) and almost missed my flight. Most of the airports I go to are under 5 minutes to the facility or on site. Since budget doesn't run the buses they can't really help the situation but they signed on to this project. Also the buses come way less frequently off hours and there's 2 places to line up so if you're in a hurry you have to have your head on a swivel for where to go. \n\nThe other issue with renting a car in Phoenix is all the taxes and fees. After a four day rental my taxes and fees were roughly $90. Which came to an effective tax rate of 57% on my rental car for four days. I do not know any other industry where this would be remotely acceptable. Clearly this is done to gouge tourists and business people visiting the area and get them on the way out so they cannot complain more about this non-sense. If you can go to Phoenix and not rent a car, do it. Otherwise you'll have to grin and bear it.",0
"I booked a rental through Costco Travel.....\n\nthe line was extremely long( like waiting for a ride at Six Flags).\n\nIf you prefer to use a debit card, they will slap $200 dollars more on hold in your account and run a credit check.

A slip was given to me on where my rental is parked, and I had to get to it on my own; without any personal interaction if i had any questions about the vehicle.

I didn't like a cherry red car.\n\nOther companies gave you options and are more personal. Some even pull the car up for you, and help you put your luggage in the trunk.\n\nI like to be treated like a princess.\n\nTheir insurance is also pretty expensive.

"Is it possible to give zero stars?

Our flat tire light also went on midway through our trip.\n\nThe \""""manager\"""" was completely unapologetic, blamed us for everything, and told us we had to specify a car with a working outlet.  Seriously?  Isn't a cigarette lighter standard on, oh, EVERY CAR EVER? \n\nIt seems dangerous to me, not to have a GPS or phone charger outlet in a car in the desert.  Call me crazy, but that's something I'd guess even the employees of Budget would appreciate.\n\nI wanted a discount or a refund of some sort for all the troubles we encountered, and they told us we should have brought the car back for an exchange.  (When, in the middle of our vacation, while we were 3 hours away at the Grand Canyon, or maybe during the two hours it took standing in line to get our reserved car?)  The manager actually hung up on me once, and had me shaking I was so mad!  A week later, we received two $25.00 vouchers for Budget Rent a Car in Scottsdale.  AS IF.  I wouldn't put my worst enemy through that.  Budget, I truthfully doubt you have anyone with a soul working in upper management, middle management, or customer service, but if you do- please, see my review and others reviews, then look at the reviews for other car rental companies and take this feedback to heart.\n\nNEVER use Budget.\n\nNEVER use Budget.  Never.  Never never never ever.  \n\nNO.  Just move on to any other car rental company.  Better yet, buy and sell a used car while you're in Phoenix.  It would take less time than the shuttle and rental counter.  \nIt doesn't matter that you used orbitz.  It doesn't matter that you have a coupon.  Go somewhere else.  Your time and mental health are more precious.\n\nSTOP- turn around and go somewhere else!   Never.  Just, no. Don't.  I would rather have a simultaneous Brazilian wax and root canal than go back to this Budget. \n\nAlso available: \nThrifty\nDollar\nEnterprise\nAlamo\n(But check reviews before renting from any of these!)",0

"I rented a car for seven days from Budget Rentals at Minneapolis airport on the 29th January.  The service I received was friendly and efficient and I was even talked into upgrading  to a Blk Mazda CX-9 FWD for an extra $35 for the week.  After an enjoyable weeks holiday, I returned the car back to Budget at Minneapolis airport, On delivering the car to Budgets car park in the multi-storey car park, I had not even got out of the car when I was presented with a bill for $126.55. On enquiring what the bill was for at the rental desk, I was informed that  the tank was only 5/8th full of petrol, and they had billed me for the remaining 3/8th of petrol, a total of $126.55.  They had charged me for 9 gallons of petrol at \u00a39,299 per gallon plus additional charges.\nThis exhorbitant charge is not made aware to you when hiring the car and indeed is hidden away in the very small print  when you are provided with the agreement form, even then it clear states on the form that \"""" Please return the vehicle with the same fuel level  as you received it, if you do not, additional fuel  fees MAY apply.  It is quite clear that this is a deliberate ploy by Budget  to make a substantial income from this and other hidden charges and is clearly quite literally nothing short of highway robbery,\nTHEREFORE, I WOULD LIKE TO BRING THIS TO EVERYBODY'S ATTENTION WHO HIRES A VEHICLE FROM BUDGET.  Most other rental company's DO NOT  employ these shoddy and arrogant charges, and can only suggest that people think twice about renting a vehicle from this company, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.",0

"Arrived tonight just after our scheduled time and found ourselves grabbing a number like at the dmv. I've come here once before a few years ago and this was not the case. Waited for 45 minutes before getting helped (which for us was 17 tickets being called), and was given a measly response as to why they were the only car rental company in the place with a line like that (we have more cars than everyone else, it's spring training).\n\nOne woman's job appeared to be shouting out the next number and being rude to the people who couldn't get the ticket thing to work (it stopped working twice while we were waiting and both times she didn't say a word to the very nice people who approached her and said they couldn't grab a number). I went up to ask her a question when they turned off the \""""cars available\"""" sign and she made me feel super great with her initial slow blink and one word responses. Great choice for customer service!\n\nWe were assigned a car after the standard up-sell attempts and walked down to the lot to find no car in our spot. Two people in the lot were extremely nice and helpful and got us another car right away but it was done so hastily and without checking with anyone that I wondered if that's what happened to our car in the first place. \n\nAfter being told we would have a full tank of gas and agreed to bringing it back that way, the car was at a solid 3/4 tank.\n\nIt was bad enough I don't plan on using Budget ever again.",0
"BEWARE OF BUDGET CAR RENTALS:  I reserved a Budget rental in Germany and the ONLY option I requested was a navigation system.

I contacted Budget and they explained to me that the refueling option did not work the way it was described to me and they refused to refund the money the money to me.\n\nTHIS WAS A MISLEADING OPTION AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE YOU AVOID USING BUDGET ALTOGETHER.  I gave them three opportunities to make it right and they refused.!!!  Shame on you Budget!!!  Remember, there are many car rental choices available.",0
I'm giving Budget one star already. After reading bad reviews about other car companies I went with Budget. Don't rent from here if you don't have lots of time to sit in the airport. Every other company I could have walked up and rented a car. Here I'm number 27 - they are on 13 - and I've been sitting here for 20 minutes.,0

"Don't go there, they trick you!\n\nI prebooked and paid my car a couple of weeks up front. I was looking for a mid size car (5 People, 4 Lagguage) to have enough space for two persons without having stuff out of the trunk. I always try to book unlimited miles and a full covered insurance packeage. That`s what I booked here as well. \n\nMy voucher stated as a car type \""""standard / intermediate\"""" similar to a Dodge Avenger. \nI don\u00b4t knew this type of car, but the key facts were right. I needed this car to drive from Phoenix to Sedona (1.5 hours) and just a bit around to discover the area.\n\nWaiting time was super, just 3 numbers in front of me. \n\nThe guy behind the counter was very nice, but now I know he was it just to trick me!\n\nHe tried as usually to sell me an additional insurance, but I told him to look at my booking which covers everything. He confirmed friendly \""""Oh, yes, your are right. What I am talking about\"""".\n\nHe asked me what car I want. He has an Impala and a Malibu?\nBecause I didn't know the cars I said to him that I don' t care, as long as the car has enough room. \n\nHe told me the Malibu would be nicer because it has a 6 cylinder engine and this would be better for my drive to Sedona.\n\nAt this point I was still impressed how kind and service orientated he was.\n\nWe went to the paperwork and he explained me everything what will popup on the touchscreen which I had to sign. Of course (unfortunately)  I was not reading every line in this contract.\n\nFinally he gave me the papers and explained where the car was located. So far so good. I found the car and had a good time with it. I told my wife about the nice guy and the service.\n\n4 days later, when I came back I did the checkout. The guy who scanned the bar code gave me a paper strip with the words:\"""" Everything is ok, there is nothing exept your upgrade\""""\n\nUpgrade??? I have never booked an upgrade!!!!\n\nI went again to the counter (lukely I had enought time before my flight) and spoke to an employee. She asked me to bring the original contract, which I gave to her. I explained that I have never upgraded and neither asked to do it. \n\nI have booked a car for $155  and now I should pay additional $179 for an upgrade. Who books a car for $155 and afterwards more than that again for an upgrade?\n\nShe told me that she has to asked the manager. My feeling was now that this situation and complain was nothing new to her.\n\nThe manager came and explained me that I have signed everything. I told him that if I would forced to read every line in a rental car agreement it would proably take hours. Nobody would do that. Customers have to trust the companies and the employees.\n\nHe explained me that he would read everything before he would signed it. He then said something to his employee and left without any further word to me. She started to enter something into the computer, without telling me. \n\nShe handed me a new printout.  I asekd her if everything has been credited now so that there is a zero balance. \n\nShe took the paper back, looked at it and confirmed \""""yes\"""".\n\nI looked at the paper and in deed the last line showed \""""Your total due: $0.00\""""\n\nI thanked her and went to the airport to get my flight. I was lucky and hoped that the employee would have to explain it to his manager with some consequences.\n\nAt home I checked my account and saw that I have still paid  $115.56 for the upgrade. They tricked me twice!!!\n\nSo be aware of what you sign there. If you read all the reviews you will see there is a red line. That\u00b4s their way to get your money. Don\u00b4t belive what someone tells you. Take your time to read every line and number on your contract.\n\nBut much better and easier: AVOID such companies!!!\nThere are several other out there and your total will be much less at the end!\n\nNever ever Budget!",0
"I would have given no stars if I was able to.  I was completely tricked and mislead! \nI rented a car through air miles for a vehicle from Budget Sky Harbour Phoenix.  I was told that the only charge on my credit card was going to be the taxes.  When my son & I arrived we waited about an hour and when we got to the counter the woman said we are giving you an upgrade and I said \""""oh, how nice!\""""  After giving my credit card and being asked about insurance I was asked to sign the signature pad so I did.  After arriving home my Visa was charged an extra almost $400.  We called airmiles and they looked into this for us.  She said the reason we were charged is because we agreed to a 3 level upgrade and rental of a Satellite radio system.  There was not one mention of any price increase or satellite radio, we never agreed to either of these charges.  We were going through airmiles to save some money.  When I signed the signature pad there was nothing for me to read I just signed my name having faith that Budget was not ripping me off!  When they sent me a copy of the contract there was not even initials beside these supposed upgrades that I agreed to.  It did have my signature under some small print (that I never saw on the signature pad) saying I had agreed to these 2 charges so they completely mislead me.  Not one word about paying anything extra!  Having gone back and forth with Budget, they are not budging at all on giving me my money back.  I was completely tricked and will never use Budget again.  This is the first time I have ever written a negative review.  Budget most definitely deserves this review so just be aware before signing.  After having done some research I see that this is common practice with Budget, shame they can get away with this.",0
"So yeah.  Zero stars for this place.  I went for spring break with my fiance.  I get that part of this has to do with the fact I am there in a high tourist season, however our hotel at a decent place was less that what it cost us to rent a Kia Soul.    We were not allowed to change our car even though we had no desire to be driving that.  We were basically harrassed about insurance for ten min.  They told us that we had to top off the fuel within a five mi radius and bring in a receipt with this information, as that failure to do this would incur a penalty.\n\nTo put another driver on the vehicle was more than twenty per day.  In some cities in a non tourist season you can get an economy car for that price.\n\nThe USB connection ports didnt work so charging iPods ect wasnt going to happen.\n\nThe major complaint happened at check in.  We were in a rush and I left some items in the vehicle.  I noticed that I left them when I was in the line for Southwest (that was a horror show as well), I called three times from the airport, once from the plane and once from our layover.  Then I called from St Louis where we landed.  Each time leaving messages.  I got a call a day later.  A majority of the items werent found.\n\nThe woman in the lost and found was nice, however couldnt explain what happend.  I spoke with her manager who told me that she would look in to it and call me the next day.  That was three months and five left messages by myself ago.  All she needed to do was say that they looked at the video tape.  Thats it.  I heard story after story from the Lost and Found woman about what they did, however it really never made sense.  Why some and not all of the items were recovered doesnt make sense until this day.\n\nSo while I understand that I didnt have to go to spring training and then it was my fault that I lost things, this was a rip off with a serious lack of courtesy to the end user.",0

"BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!  RUDE AND PUSHY!  DO NOT GO HERE.  TOO MANY OTHER CHOICES.  I reserved ahead and prepaid for a economy car (Ford Focus or similar).  Since the reservation was in my name and paid with my credit card, I approached the desk by myself, while my husband and 24 yr old son waited elsewhere.  The guy at the desk tried to upsell me but I had spent too much time researching the best deal so I was not going to spend any more money. (Sky Harbor is already bad enough with the fees.)  Then he decided to tell me that the only car they had was a Volkswagon Beetle!  For 3 adults!  I continued to tell him no and then he got rude.  Not sure if this is directed at all women travelers but he was over the top ignorant!  Then we started with the additional coverages and/or gas fill up.  Finally he figured out that I wasn't falling for any of it.  We finished the paperwork and he handed me the paperwork without saying a word.  He just wanted me to go away.  When we went down to pick up the car, no Beetle was in site and the car was a Ford Focus with 4 drs!   He didn't even tell me that they had found a more appropriate car.  \nCar was fine, return was fine.  \nI complained when they sent me a survey to complete and someone sent me an email about the \""""mistakes\"""" that were made!  They were not mistakes!  They must train these people to treat customers that way.   NEVER AGAIN!",0
"Just returned a vehicle which I rented on Thursday September 11th. I trusted the rep heard my requests and didn't fully read the print out. I advised her that I had my personal insurance and declined theirs. Unfortunately she added the charge and it was placed on my bill bringing my weekend rental to a total of 344.77. That is the same amount as my car note. When I noticed the additional fee, I spoke to the counter.... their response is \""""I've worked with Christina before and she doesn't typically make those mistakes.\"""" Guess there is a first for everyone. I even suggested they pull the video tape so they can see the hand gesture I made to say I didn't want the insurance. Of course that option was also declined. Seems like budget rental cars doesn't believe in human error. I actually like budget rental cars but I think I'll switch to something a little more supportive of regular customers. I probably would understand if this were my first rental but I rent cars regularly. I even declined the insurance on line! So with my story being told, I'll take this one on the chin. It is my fault for trusting a company that has a generally positive reputation with the details of my business. Trust that from now on I will second guess every step of the way.",0
"Budget sucks.\n\nI bought a combined reservation through Orbitz (hotel, flight, car) and paid before I got there (including for insurance)\n\nI show up to the counter and without telling me there was a new charge, they offered me a new Ford Fusion. Gullible me was like \""""Oh, that's cool, sure\"""". She then tries to run my card for what I think its to place a hold in case anything happens, and she says \""""Sorry, your card isn't going through\"""". \""""For a hold? How much is the hold\"""" \""""$300\"""". \n\nWHAT.\n\nShe wanted to charge me for an upgrade and the highest insurance without even letting me know. If I had had a card limit over $300 I would have been charged without even knowing it.\n\nWhen I told her I want the cheapest card, she said I'd still have to pay insurance. I mentioned I had bought insurance through my reservation and she basically null and voided the insurance that was previously purchased, saying \""""Yeah, it doesn't really do much\"""". Well, cool. I just wasted 50 bucks I could have spent elsewhere. So I purchased the cheapest insurance possible and it was still $175 for 3 days for the cheapest car you could get. \n\nThe only positive thing I can say is even the cheapest car was a Kia Soul which I loved driving.\n\nLooking back, I probably could have avoided buying insurance all together if I would have brought my proof of insurance with me for my own vehicle. These people tried to take advantage of me because I look young and was alone. I will never ever ever use Budget again in any location due to this experience.",0
"Quite curt, if not rude, employees. Rep at the desk clearly didn't care that my reservation quoted a price a few dollars cheaper than I was billed. Tried to upsell me since I reserved the smallest car, though of course they didn't have any of the smallest so I got a bigger one no charge. Rep at the car return couldn't be bothered to hand me my receipt, just tossed it in the trunk and mumbled something as he walked away. \n\nTotally not worth the extra frequent flyer miles you get with Southwest for using Budget.",0
I am sitting here right now APPALLED at the 30 minute wait to get my rental call. I wish I'd checked YELP before I booked. This is not worth the few pennies I saved. I WILL NEVER RENT FROM BUDGET AGAIN!!!!!\nPicked up the car got in line to exit and the nonsense continues. Only one of three gates open. It's not like they don't know how many cars are coming ...  7 cars ahead of us and we all had to back up because car number one had the wrong vehicle. Car number 2 rammed the gate before it opened and punctured the tire. Unbelievable.  WE ARE JUST NOW LEAVING THE GATE. 2 hours after arriving at PHX.,0

Talking about stains. Believe me, there was no stains! There was some crumbs on the seat and some dirt on the floors but nothing a vacuum couldn't handle.

Honestly, it was N&D that turned me on to Cazwell. Some times the restaurant and movie reviews aren't painful. Otherwise, there is no worthwhile content in this paper.

Now, there really isn't that much gotta-read-it urgency anymore. Pick it up on Friday, on a Saturday, or a Sunday, and it's as \""""meh\"""" as it gets.",0

"I am a huge seafood fan. I grew up going to places similar to this. Nothing fancy. The difference to me is the prices here are high for what you get and the Shrimp was awful. Their breading is unusually thick (about half the shrimp piece was breading). I did like the fish and the service was good. I also was expecting hushpuppies and grits for the price. Will I go back. Maybe, but I will only order the fish. It's too bad, because Phoenix could use a GOOD cheap Seafood place.",0
"Um, hello, this place has been open for over 60 years.  On that fact  alone they receive 5 stars from me.\n\nDo they have some magic type of fryers that no one else in the world has? I think so because I honestly couldn't tell my meal was fried at all. \n\nI had the fish, shrimp, and chips combo and every item was crispy, light, and as ungreasy as fried food can get.  \n\nThe interior is old and outdated for sure and it's totally in the \""""hood\"""" but who cares.  Darn good fish and chips IMHO.  \n\n---PS, they have one of those pump thingies of ranch on their condiment bar so even if you don't like your meal just cover it in good old American ranch dressing.     Ranch makes everything better!",1
"I drive by this place every day on the way home from work.  So after reading good reviews I decided to try it.  After a dinner of fried everything I think I will need a cardiac exam.  I had fried fish and shrimp and fries.  My daughter had popcorn shrimp.  My dad had fried okra and fried zucchini.  We all shared.  The zucchini was good, I like their batter, but I would have preferred thicker slices of zucchini.  I'm not afraid of having an actual vegatable.  The fish was ok but  I had better at Gordon Biersch.  Sorry, I usually prefer the local guy just on general principle, but this one isn't it.  The fries were not great the shrimp was so heavily breaded that I couldn't taste the shrimp and the popcorn shrimp were all bread.  We did get a side of coleslaw that was as good as any I've had from the Safeway deli.",0
"Have known this place has been around for quite some time and have always said that we needed to try.  Well, finally had a chance to do so and I must say I was pleased.  Now I'm thinking what took so long?\n\nOrdered the 2 pc fish with chips.  The fish, nice sized pieces of cod, with a nice and crunchy coating was delicious.  My friend's son, who's 13 and just released from hospital wanted to go to lunch, got the 2 pc fish, 2 pc shrimp and chips.  The shrimp were large sized and he enjoyed it tremendously.  I was surprised he ate almost everything.  \n\nThough we live in Goodyear, will definitely be going back for more.",1
"Had the 2 pc. fish & chips. Fish was very fresh. Batter was good and crunchy. Fries we ok because they were fresh, but underwhelming. The cole slaw was pretty much like what you buy at the deli counter. My friend had the fish and chicken tenders. Skip the chicken. Overall I was expecting a bit more from most of the reviews.",0
"For the past 15 years or so, I have been a satisfied and happy customer of KKL.  I absolutely love everything about Knock Kneed.  The fish is among the best that you will find in the Phoenix area.  I am also a big fan of the okra.  \n\nThe ambiance here is also quite enjoyable.  There is plenty of seating inside the restaurant and the nautical themed decorations make it one of a kind.\n\nYou can't go wrong here!",1
"Love their fried fish with fries and the endless supply of ranch. Oh sooo good! The price is right, the service is ok. There's room for improvement. Call in your orders during rush hours.",1
"After months of passing this place and wanting to try their food, we finally made it to KKL.  What we weren't expecting from this place was the very pricey menu for fish, shrimp and chips (french fries from a bag, I'm sure)!  The shrimp was different and tastey, I had 4 pieces with chips and also a side of mushrooms.  Chris had clams, chips and a side of cole slaw and of course we ordered the hushpuppies which everyone raves about.  This meal was close to $30 dollars!   Some people may feel that isn't bad for lunch at a seafood place, however for the area the food, which isn't like just from the ocean, it's from a bag - it's way too much money and your gut will feel like a grease pit after eating here!\n\nMy advice, skip this place if you can!",0
"I haven't eaten here for many years (decades).  Was looking for a place simiilar to Skipper's Fish & Chips (NW - Seattle) chain.  Was hoping that I could find the fish similar; it is the breading is very simlar to what I remembered; since I used to work there in the 70's; early 80's...Tried the seafood platter, Clam strips were good, coleslaw was fresh and not overly sweet; fries were fresh and didn't taste fishy; but the fish, the fish is what will bring me back again & again.\nREVISED - Okay, this is becoming a staple in my diet.  Have been there probably once a week for the past 5-6 weeks!!!",1
I can not give my opinion on the fish cause I only get the shrimp cocktail and hush puppies. I just can't get passed it. I have to order them. If my view on the menu is limited then so be it. As far as the shrimp cocktail and hush puppies are concerned. I love this place.,1
"Do I really have to give them even one star? \n\nIn the area so i dropped in for a quick lunch.  Had the shrimp plate with fries. Here goes:\n1.  The prices are outrageously high considering location, restaurant decor and quality of food. You cannot have lunch here for less than $11 unless you order one shrimp.  Any local chinese buffet will give you shrimp for a lot less than that.\n2. My shrimp looked like long barrels rather than a shrimp shape. This is due to the fact that they cut the shrimp in the middle and almost split it to make it look longer.\n3.  The shrimp had too much batter.  At one point the \""""shrimp\""""( what was left of it after I took a bite), came out and the \""""barrel of fried batter\"""" was left\n4.  The french fries were from a bag --frozen.\nBeing from the East Coast, I know what fresh seafood tastes like. This is NOT it folks.  This place makes Long John Silver seem like a 5 star restaurant and it's a lot cheaper too.  \nIt is an outrage as a \""""restaurant\"""".  All they do is fry up every piece of seafood that YOU can buy frozen at CostCo or Sam's.\nDon't do this to yourself.  When you are in the area and hungry, go to the Jack in the Box across the street or some other fast food place. You'll be better off. \n\nand.... I cannot believe that the people who gave this place 4  and 5 stars are for real. They have to be the relatives of the owners.  There is no other explanation.",0
we try to come here whenever we are in the area as hubby use to work by here and use to come once a month or so.\nthe fish is awesome and so is the french fries!!\ni did need to reorder a piece of fish as some meat in it but they took good care of us!!\nthere were 3 of us and the bill was $30-little pricy but we cant find a fish fry that tastes as good as this.\natmosphere is older but the food is good!!\ntry it you just might like it!! :)\nsandy :),1
"Fish and chips was very bland. I like to have a little bit of flavor aside from the sauce that I put on but this fish didn't have it. It seemed fresh, just lacking. The fries were disappointing too. Probably won't be back.",0
"If you want good fish and chips this is the place. hand filleted  very light batter on the fish, fries are old fashioned not processed and frozen elsewhere. The only place that compares is Spud Fish and Chips in Seattle WA on Greenlake.\n\nThese are the best fish and chips in the World!",1
"Where is the negative 2 stars button?  \n\nThey take cheap fish, we assume they thaw it before throwing it on the floor for the flavor, and into the grease (which smells lovely by the way).\n\nThen, they serve this bland, unseasoned \""""food\"""" to you and laugh all the way to the bank.\n\nNo taste buds?  This is the place for you!  The last time I entered was was cuz purely by accident.  The next time will be duck hookers and bullets....  Never again on purpose.  There's not even any cats near their dumpster.  Animals have keen 7th senses.\n\nThey owe me $12 and 40 mins of my life back!  And ppl thought Pete's was bad?",0
These people where not very nice . I don't normally waist time writing bad reviews on things I don't like. Something should be said .  This place was horrible !!!! Don't waist you're time or money.,0
"My grand parents came here back when it was called \""""lazy Lew's\"""" back in the 50's. The place is a total dive but it's fitting and its in an industrial part of phoenix. However the food is great and so is their home made hot sauce",1
We had a family lunch today. The staff allowed us to reserve (without advance notice) the back room. We all had a great lunch. It was everyone's first time (except the wife and me). Everyone really enjoyed what they ordered.  There was 17 of us (10 adults and 7 grand children).  I wish the whole family could have been there..\nI had not in my 20 + years ordered or seen the hamburgers they serve there. They are huge!  A couple of us don't care for fish. Anyway they said the burgers were great.\n\nThank you Knock Kneed Lobster for a great lunch and for the great service and friendly atmosphere. You helped make a good memory.,1
"Crappy food, servers seem like drug addicts. Crab legs are over priced, precut and frozen. Go elsewhere for seafood.",0
Great shrimp that has a wonderful crust.  Always the large gulf shrimp you love.  Just added fish tacos which are decent but the shrimp is really why you come; and the fish is great too.,1
We saw the yelp reviews and decided to try it \nWOW it was great!\nThe crab legs are worth it and so is the cajun talapia\nThe garlic mashed side was great and the grilled shrimp was delicious\nDefinitely a local dive restaurant with good food on plastic plates... Give it a try,1
"There are some things that must be experienced in life to truly appreciate: your first kiss, your first fine dining experience, your first swap meet. \n\nPark 'n Swap didn't pop my swap meet cherry, but it did impress me enough to forget about my real first time in Tucson. PnS, situated near the greyhound park, is a sprawling mecca of bargains galore, tchotchkes, crazy crap and some pretty useless garbage. My BFF and I have a method: We case each aisle after we get a beer or two or 5, working our way to the back of the lot. About half way through, we usually stop for wings and fries from Long Wong's, get another beer, then finish off cruising the merchants. \n\nOn a side note, I'm hoping to return very soon to scout out a DVD copy of \""""Teen Witch\"""" so I can have a Top That event. \n\nMore than the good-to-great deals, the highlight of your visit to the PnS is people watching. Yes, Indoor Swap Meet used to have the Phony Pony Sisters (bah, where have they gone?), but PnS has such a plethora of Jerry Springer wannabes that it's worth twice--no, thrice!--the cost of admission. \n\nWith the light rail station right in front of PnS, it's going to be hard for me to find excuses as to why I cannot get my entertainment and morning drink on in one place. It's my Saturday and Sunday morning therapy.",1
"this only gets two stars because it was pure entertainment and I got in for free. \nI saw people leaving with bags full of stuff and after walking the entire park all I could think was \""""what in the WORLD could they have seriously bought?!\"""" \n\nIt was a bunch of the most random junk.

Only good on Fridays. The other days it's just venders. Friday actually has real people selling their own stuff.,0
"This is a wonderful alternative to going on vacation at a fancy resort. The options are limitless and the attractions are many. There truly is something for everyone here. \n\nThey have a kids area with rides from your elementary school carnival.

There is a petting zoo, and you can even feed and ride miniature livestock!\n\nYou can buy a bird here, and even get a brazillian wax for $45 from a toothless woman. Dining options include pork rinds, funnel cakes, and snow cones.\n\nIn all seriousness, it's only $2, the people watching is decent, they have beer, and you might find something cool. I didn't think the prices were spectacular, but maybe I have unrealistic expectations.",0
"I had a bid done and after a couple weeks I called back to have the work done, and the person that did the bid wasn't there any more. (should have been a red flag). So I was told to call another person. I called and left a message, I hear back from him a week later... he told me they would honor the bid but would need a faxed copy of it, it being 2010 I asked if I could email him the original bid that was EMAILED TO ME? He said that he didn't have email so no, I would need to fax it like it was 1993. I did that and didn't hear back form him... and didn't hear back from him... finally I called and left a message again, and I didn't hear back from him. FINALLY, after calling twice I cot a hold of him... He said, he would have the installation people give me a call. They did and set an appointment. The day before the appointment, I got a call from a Baker secretary asking for my credit card information... ? I asked why and she explained that they were going to need to have it to pay for the insulation, i asked if we would pay when the work was done? She said, no it works better if they take my credit card... So i agreed BUT stressed the fact that I did not what to be changed for work that was not done yet... as you can probably guess, they went a head a charged my card. I called and asked why they ran my card... she explained that it was company policy. I talked to another sales guy who said there was nothing he could do... I left a message for \""""Mr. Fax\"""" and still have not heard back.\n\nThe next day I get a call 3 hours before the appointment saying that they are at our house ready to do the insulation. I explain that the appointment is in 3 hours and that no one will be there until the allotted time, as it was a APPOINTMENT. He is a little miffed because he was about to get out early for the day but instead has to go and pick his nose for 3 hours...\n\nOver all Banker was a disaster... I would not recommend using them to put insulation in a dog house.",0
"Very professional. The quote they gave was very reasonable. My house stays warmer now in the colder weather, and is even cooler when it is hot. My utility bills have gone down because of the work they did on my home. I would recommend them.",1
"Recently, I had Banker Insulation upgrade the insulation in my attic and was extremely pleased with the positive results it has had on keeping the heat inside my home throughout the past colder months. These guys had a great eye for detail and completely treated my home as if they were working on their own. I will definitely recommend Banker Insulation to anyone who is looking for an established reputable company that stands behind the quality of their work!",1
"Banker came out to do a bid on some additional cellulose insulation in our attic.  Instead, based on recommendation by Grant Gosselin due to the allergy issues I have, as well, poor attic design (which had little/no insulation in spots) we did Spray Foam Insulation.  Let me tell you, amazing.\n\nThere was 2 step process, the first part went well and our whole home was slated the week after Memorial Day.  Due to some scheduling issues, there were delays which could have pushed the Foam for an entire week.  Grant stepped up and got 2 crews on a Saturday to complete the job.  As well, we had 2 additional visits to clean up some issues  While the issues were minor, Grant and Banker got everything taken care of with flying colors!\n\nNow our AC is running at a max 5-7hrs a day (compared to 24x7) during the heat.  The energy savings is amazing and I would highly recommend anyone in the valley to consider spray foam.  While it costs more up front (and there is some HVAC work to be done) the long term savings are incredible!",1
"I have been an advocate of Banker Insulation since 2007 when they did some insulation work for my Garage in Surprise. Did a great job and couldn't be happier. In 2011, they did it again to our home in Goodyear. Great job again. Decided to use them at our business location in Goodyear, why wouldn't we. The actual job of removing the old insulation and installing the new looks great. But prior to the insulation job, we had the epoxy floors done so keeping them nice was critical. The sales manager suggested some boots for the lift so that the lift didn't cause issues with the floor. Sounds great to me. After the job was done, the floors were scraped and scratched and it did not look like either of the lifts had any boots on them. I do not know how they got scraped up, whether is what the lifts supports, staples on the floors and turning on them, I really don't care what did it. I just wanted them to be exactly how they were. Come to find out, that boots/diapers are for the bottom of the lifts, not for the tires, so that the lifts do not leak oil on the floors. That was not made known until after we were trying to come to problem solving answer. My $10,000+ epoxy floors don't look like $10,000+ floors any longer. They would rather say that it was not their fault when no one else is in the shop while they are working then keep a continued customer happy. $750 out of a $6000+ invoice, It is really sad. Am I an advocate now? I can't. If they come back and offer to fix the floor, I would say that they did the right thing and would become an advocate for them again.",0
"I read some bad reviews about Papago Plating but thought I would give them a try anyway. I should have trusted my instinct and not allow them to chrome plate my bumpers on my 1950 Chevy that I am restoring. They did very lousy work, poor craftsmanship. You can see the weld marks, they use very little chrome and the bumpers are all chipped up when they return them back o you. They wrapped em in bubble wrap to try and cover up the flaws but once I got home and unwrapped them I was very disappointed in their work. I paid $600 bucks for two bumpers and it looks like only one light coat of chrome, I need to send them out to Tuscon to get them dipped right, I just threw away $600 bucks. Don't trust that old man at Papago, he might have been good at one time, but their work sucks right now.",0
"In the past I had tried another place to have some parts re-chromed. 6 weeks later, they hadn't even started the job, so I was willing to try Papago because of my horrible experience with the other spot. This was slightly better, but not by far. I am starting to realize that this type of business plays by it's own rules... Deadline is an unknown word, and on time is a foreign concept. Work was supposed to due on the 20th, and on the 2nd of the next month, I picked up the item the day they called and said it was ready. To boot, the item looked really crappy. The front office was filthy, like it hadn't been cleaned in... OK... Looked like it had never been cleaned. Ever. So, if anyone knows a place for re-chroming, that is reliable, on time, and does a good job, let me know. I'm not holding my breathe!",0
"I was excited when I bought my project car. Hey, it was in pretty good shape for its vintage and it's very rare. I did need to have the bumper chromed as they were off a late mid century Japanese car. These cars where not known for their sturdy materials, every knows that. \n\nWell, I decided to put all my faith in the folks over at Papago and it turned out to be a massive blunder. Well, they probably did their best. But, their best isn't good enough to restore your dream. Hey, if you need a tub faucet done, go to them. In addition to a filthy location, you'll get some rudeness, a lot of lateness (and a few \""""We'll have it tomorrow afternoons\"""") and then, when they botch the job, they'll tell you it was the material they had to work with? Really, the same material that I brought to you weeks before and asked you to make perfect? The material?\n\nSo, now I have to live with this substandard job and take it to a real restoration place, one that knows what they're working with and won't blame the material for their botched work. I gave them a 1 ranking, after all, they get me SOMETHING back. Nothing I want, but it is something. \n\nEmail me, I'll show you the kind of work they did for me.",0
"Went to Papago Plating because there were only a few places in town that could do the brass plating I needed. The project was simple, just needed to brass plating done on a name plate for a showcar. The first time I picked up the piece the brass plating was already flaking off. The edges were bare lacking any plating at all. And to make it worse they even DRILLED through one of the smallest pieces so they could plate it without contacting me to see if that was ok. I asked to have it redone and the older guy that works the counter just kept saying \""""Well it's not going to come out any better anyway.\"""" I asked them to redo the last tiny piece that they had drilled through, again the old man was very reluctant. Today, I tried to go pick up the piece hoping the nightmare was over but instead after waiting about 5 minutes in the office I was told to come back on Monday. I'm pretty sure they lost it. \n\nI'm definitely going to find a new place to get my projects plated and I suggest you do too.  \n\nSave your money and STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!\n\nTheir customer service is terrible, they are rude and never on time. The work is shoddy at best. As others mentioned too, the shop is dirty and unorganized, I have no idea how they keep their business.",0
"This review is for Terminal 2  - otherwise known as the 9th level of hell.  \r\n\r\nSky Harbor has several terminals and I have always passed through the main (America West) terminal in my travels to and from Phoenix.  It can get crowded, but hey, it's an airport.  Get used to it.\r\n\r\nTerminal 2 however, 'home' to Continental and United Express flights, is the most abysmal place I've seen in a long time.  The 'security' guard I had to pass in order to get to the metal detectors was more interested in her split ends than in looking at my photo ID or checking that it actually matched the name on the ticket.  The Express flight gates are all housed in a small separate building that one must walk through an outdoor area in order to reach.  The entire terminal smells vaguely of mildew and disuse.  And all but one of the eating establishments is either boarded up or roped off and the place that is open...ewww.  \r\n\r\nI ordered a pastrami and swiss from the less-than-friendly counter person and after discussing the appropriate change I should have received back for my $20 bill, I traveled down the smeared glass to pick up my to-go sandwich.  Which had morphed into ham.  I didn't order ham. Well the ticket says sandwich special and that's ham.  Excuse me, but your board says 'special Pastrami and Swiss or Ham and Swiss' and I did not order ham - I don't EAT ham.  Sandwich maker goes down the line to have discussion with counter-person.  I wait.  Impatiently.  I am exceedingly hungry as well as minorly hung-over and I just want my *&$%(#$&  food.  Finally, I get my pastrami and swiss on (grudgingly admitted) good rye bread.\r\n\r\nOne star for the friendly sky-cap who took my luggage (OUTSIDE the terminal) and one star for the good bread.  Otherwise, if you must travel through this airport, take America West.",0
"Stuck here for 3hrs on a layover.  What to do, what to do?  This airport is huge.  It seems to be the main hub for all flights in the southwest.  Stop off at the gift shop to scan the magazine racks.  OK, that keeps me busy for only 20 min.  What else to do?  Let's try to catch up on some reviews.  What's it gonna cost me to get online?  Hmmm...Sky Harbor Public WLAN?  Could it be?  YES!!!  FREE WI-FI!!!  Makes the layover that much more bearable.",1
Fly here a lot on TED.  The terminal sucks.  When you are hanging out layed over there is nothing to do or eat.  They did remodel but it is just as bad as before.  I am stuck flying into here everymonth.  One of the good things is there was a smoking room but that got demolished so now you can smoke post checkpoint outside.,0
"In 15 years or so when there is a line that connects the light rail to the airport, and there is a train that takes you to any terminal, to the econo parking and to the rental cars, this place will be a solid rocking 5 stars.  Right now, it's a weak 4.  \n\nThey have awesome signage on the roads leading in and out of the airport.  But if you don't know EXACTLY which one to take - you are kinda screwed because you could end up going to the other side of the airport before you can get out.  Once you know where you want to go, it's a breeze.  They've done quite a bit of work recently on the inside of the airport to make it more customer friendly.  And I have to say, pure location wise - I love that it's so close to city center. I know it has some disadvantages, but when you need to go, and fast, it's awesome.\n\nDecent food offerings and free wi-fi are great, though I think some of the stores could do a little updating but that might just be me...\n\nI haven't had to go through the new \""""see you naked\"""" screen - but I'm psyched to check it out, though I wish it was from the other side...",1
"Aaah, the familiar blast of air conditioning fans my face as we walked out of the gate from the plane... \n\nWhy is it that just one to two days before arriving in Arizona, it was 60 degrees?--the same degree of coolness as the bay, but when we touched Phoenix ground, it's all of a sudden 90 degrees??  And of course, when we leave next week, the temp will plummet back down (at least, according to the news).  The Gods have it in store for my fiance and I to somehow *enjoy* the heat as we visit friends and family twice a year in Mesa.\n\nAnyway, back to the airport..there was this lady parked on the loading zone for 15 minutes waiting for her party.  WTF??  In Oakland, they'll sic the security on you when you so as much touch the curb for 30 seconds without picking or dropping off someone.  I once nearly got into a car accident trying to avoid their palms from hitting my trunk..",0
"Overall it's a really good airport for a city the size of Phoenix.  If you check in and print out your boarding pass beforehand and don't check any bags - you should be fine here.  The waits at security aren't that bad for the most part.  One of the highlights here is the award-winning art collection - noted as one of the best in an airport nationwide.\n\nOne reason this airport doesn't get 5 stars is the lack of access between terminals (all they offer is bus service) and between the airport and public transportation - supposedly a link with the future light rail system will come in 5 years or so. \n\nThe difference is terminals has been noted already - but personally I prefer using Terminals 2 and 3 to avoid the zoo that is Terminal 4 - especially to avoid the Southwest (Greyhound of the Skies) crowd.  But if you do have to deal with Terminal 4 - it is large and modern with people movers, offering almost anything you could possibly need. \n\nI especially like Terminal 2 because it is smaller and less frantic.   Downside is there are less eateries.  An Arizona Republic article recently noted that Terminal 4 eateries (Starbucks, for example) charge significantly more than in other terminals - even for the same exact food and drink!",1
"FYI - if you plan to rent a car, allow extra time.  All of the car rental agencies are located in a separate terminal.  There's just one big bus to hop onto.  In light of the new TSA regs, they have little baggies for you to put your gels into [or lip glosses in my case].  Here's the interesting thing....At PHX they're drawstring... LAX has totally different bags....draw your own conclusions.....\n\n\nETA.  GGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH....I had to update this review.  The only reason it's not one star is because my bag showed up....EVENTUALLY.  I recently had to check a bag from Phoenix to Oakland, because it takes more than a quart size bag of liquids and gels to maintain the Rhubarb for a week.  Somehow, my bag and I did not end up on the same flight.  They found it within 24 hours of me getting home.  But it was a LONG 24 hours, and they just weren't very nice about the whole thing.  At one point this chick asked what was in my bag....um, I don't know.  I told her I did not make a list because I did  not anticipate the neanderthals at PHX would lose my beloved Samsonite wheeley.  When she asked me what type of bag it was, I said, do you want a serial number????  \n\nOK, end rant.  let's hope they do better the next time.",0
"Much like everything else in Arizona, this is very large and in charge and flat.  The decor inside is a southwestern motif of zig zags that gets pretty psychedelic.  The recent renovations to Terminal 4 have been pretty impressive, although I noticed the southwest motif is still alive and well.  The bad thing? If you ever connect in Phoenix, get ready to walk your ass off. Each \""""Satelite\"""" gate is so fricken far. you are always somehow late at some point.  The great thing about it? Free Wifi. So if you ever get stranded there, at least you can chat and surf the net or what not.  It's awesome.  Randomly this airport has no terminal 1, and terminal 2 was built in like 1950.  Terminal 3 is nice, and Terminal 4 is the \""""desert jewel\"""" of them all.  Anyway, another complaint I have about this place is that baggage takes 45 minutes to come out. Annoying. Probably because its so frickin far from the gates and its massive! But again, free wifi. Score!",1
"I hate taking buses between terminals.  I hate it.  Why do I have to go outside in the god awful heat and bus all over the damned place just to get to my appropriate terminal?  Why when I arrive, am I miles from the nearest cab stand?\nAnd why was that girl at the security check point such a miserable bitch?  Waves of hatred were just rolling off of her as I had to suffer through having my ID & ticket checked.\nDear sullen and grouchy TSA employees - \nI don't really want to be here either.  Please don't be all nasty to me just because my mere presence here supplies you with this job that you clearly hate.  When I travel, I tend to have things.  Bags, IDs, tickets and what have you.  So if you, in your incredibly trying job of sitting down wearing gloves and being unhappy, find it beneath you to open the clear plastic folder my ticket is in so you can mark it off while I hold out my ID; causing me to shuffle everything I'm holding again so I can open said clear plastic folder, remove my ticket for you since moving thin plastic is CLEARLY not in your job description, show you my ticket, then shuffle again to get my ID into appropriate viewing position - an ID which you just looked at, I might not be all sunshine and rainbows to your big dark raincloud self.  No reason to try to sear me with your occular hate rays and set jaw.  Just keep on being miserable, chewing your gum, and let me get myself out of your life as quickly as possible.\nThanks!\n- All my love, \nSunshine & Rainbows R.\n\nDear United Red Carpet Club - \nI understand that you cater to the business traveler and having 'Headline Prime\"""" on in the lounge makes good sense, but on 9/11/2007, it's probably not the best idea ever to be showing us the news programs focusing on all the terrorist activity on this terrible anniversary.  Caravan of martyrs?  Letters from Bin Laden?  Warning us for a good 30 seconds that if we have small children or are sensitive in personality, that we are BEGGED to change the channel to spare us the horror of your broadcast focused on mass murder and rape?  (Which by the way, our host has just asked the man he's interviewing if he can go into more detail about the rapes, without being \""""too graphic\"""" - uh, yeah.)\nYeah, I'm totally ready to hop on a plane now.  Good thinkin.\nOh, thanks for the snacks though.  The crudite was only slightly slimy and creepy.\nYours in white knuckles and free snacks - \nLooking on the Bright Side R.",0
"The airpot is splendid.  All the rental car locations are in one place, so you just need to find the one shuttle.\n\nBut what makes this airport better than others? They provide booties for you to wear when you take off your shoes, and ziplock bags in case you forgot to put your 3 oz. bottles of whatever liquids into ziplocks.  \n\nThe airpot does need some color though. From inside the terminals looking out, the entire airport looks sand-colored.",1
"This airport has the nice walkway that have the nice trendy monitors that enable you to display announcements.  You can now display the names of the individuals you are looking for in addition to paging them.  They also provide the 1 quart plastic bags for you if you should have any liquids in your carry-on that you forgot about.  They also supply the hospital like footies so that you didn't want to be walking around in your socks or barefoot you would have a covering.  This airport seems to have the money....  The pick up area is slightly confusing because there is a South Side, and I'm not sure which side that really is...  If you are looking at the sign does it mean that it's the area in front of or behind that is the South Side area?!  There are the inner lanes where people can pick you up, and the outside lanes are where the buses and shuttles are located   This is the opposite of O'Hare and Midway where the closer lanes are for limo and bus and taxi pick up.  My friend picked me up on that side and the parking police was honking at us.  At least we didn't get ticketed.  It's interesting how each terminal has an arrival and departure ramp, as opposed to separating the arrivals and departures.  I really like how the seats at the airport terminals do not have arm rests.  I notice these things now, should I happen to have a layover I can spread out and lay on a few seats for more comfort.  They have a decent amount of restaurants as well.  I'm not sure if all the gates have a simllar set up and variety of restaurant vendors, but was the case for Gate A.",1
"As I sit a the gate 3, Terminal 2, UA1507 PHX-SFO in the plane with a 90 minute \""""SFO Flow Control\"""" and \""""Mechanical problem of rivets missing on the engine cone?!\""""  delay, I write this review. \n\nSky Harbor used to be my home base for a couple of years. It is a remarkably good airport given the tremendous growth in the Valley of the Sun. \n\nThere are 3 terminals: \nTerminal 2, the smallest and oldest, (United, Continental, others)\nTerminal 3, next largest and oldest (Delta, Northwest and many others, including international flights)\nTerminal 4, newest and bigger than the others combined, dominated by SouthWest and US AIrways (formerly America West)\n\nFor locals, there are the West and East long term parking lots. You can park in the West and walk to Terminal 2; East is much larger with an annex and hi-rise, and closer to terminal 4, but you need to take the shuttles. To help you remember which is east and west, PHX names the shuttles Gecko, RoadRunner, and one other I can't remember! \n\nFor visitors, to get a round the sprawling valley, you need to rent a car. The recently added offsite Rental car Center is huge and well organized into 4 floors with different brands on each floor, and a lot of shuttle buses that are dedicated to each terminal. It is about 1 mile from the airport, but allow 10 minutes for shuttles and loading when you drop off your car. \n\nThey have recently upgraded Terminal 2, expanding the security area and remodeling the restaurant. Terminal 2 has little in the way of food and shops. Terminal 4, organized into 7 separate buildings of gates connected with long hallways and moving sidewalks, has more food and shopping choices, but not on the order of PDX, or DEN. Because of the sheer volume of flights, Term 4 can have a long security check-in line, so plan accordingly. \n\nIf you have questions, there are roaming information assistant volunteers, wearing blue sports coats and hats. Signage is decent and most monitors have been upgraded to flat screens. \n\nSky Harbor is located close to Tempe (ASU) and no too far from downtown PHX. The edge of Mesa and Scottsdale are about 5 miles away, but it is 20 or more miles from other parts of North Scottsdale, Deer Valley and North Phoenix. Overall, it is fairly well organized and a clean airport with a lot of flight options, especially on SouthWest or US Airways, who use it as a major hub. For other airlines with a smaller foothold, you have to often connect through LAX, DEN, SLC, ORD or SFO depending on your final destination.",1
"PHX is a big airport, but we always get through quickly.  It's designed like a bus stop -- just keep moving and the other door is straight ahead of you.  Baggage showed up on time.  They've moved car rentals off the property, though.  What a surprise!  \n\nTerminal 4 has nice shopping arcades and food courts on both sides of the security checkpoint.  That makes it a pleasant experience both for travelers and for people who are there to meet them.",1
"There are worse airports to be stuck in for 8 hours with a 102 degree fever and frequent bouts of  atomic diarrhea intermingled with seemingly eternal sessions of projectile vomiting (and this is only one quarter of the way through my travel itinerary) after a night of mostly the same and a day of trying to navigate the American Aviation system in the middle of the holiday rush. Perhaps some of you recall my last cross-country travel experience (3 days stuck at SFO waiting for a flight out...). This time was not much better. \n\nBut the airport staff at Phoenix made my excruciating delay that much better by providing me with tissues, sprite (for my tummy), tons of pillows, and enough blankets to warm my shivering, shaking, feverish body. Had I not convinced them I had food poisoning, they probably wouldn't have allowed me on the flight that I finally got on at 2 a.m. after boarding my first flight at 2 p.m. the day before and facing an additional 4 hour flight. Their assistance and support helped me get some much-needed sleep while awaiting my winged chariot and made the flight I finally got on much easier than my former flight had been.\n\nI might add that there were ample food and sundries stations in the terminal I was in and I easily found all the medication I cared to take and regurgitate. I have been in and out of this particular airport for various reasons over the years and always found it rather average until this past week. Thank you, Southwest employees and airport personnel for making yet another miserable travel experience so much easier to endure.",1
"I've been in and out of Sky Harbor quite a bit and it's wearing thin on me.  Here are the things that keep it from being a good airport:\n\n1)  The rental car center, accessed by lumbering buses, is too far away and is heinously slow for picking up a car.  If you are going to shunt your rental car center to some godforsaken corner of the valley, couldn't you at least arrange a dedicated skyway for the buses or a tram or monorail or train that whisks arriving passengers there?  This is one of the few things SFO has done well, while Cleveland Hopkins and Sky Harbor have done it poorly.\n\n2)  The food options are not all that great, and as one other reviewer noted, the best bits are outside security!  Who has the cool and collected psyche to sit there idling away over a meal while gigantic queues may be forming, unseen, at the security gate while you linger?  When I arrive at an airport, my goal is to get through security at the earliest possible moment to avoid any nasty, nerve-wracking surprise death marches.  Which brings us to....\n\n3) The security lines are WAY too understaffed for the size of this operation.  Narrow little chokepoints with TSA agents of the bellowing variety, and rarely more than two lines open to get into any concourse, unless you want to walk endlessly to see if the line is shorter at another entry.   Heinous!\n\n4)  Add in an unimaginative mix of vendors and drab, Houston Bush-esque brown decor and you've got a dreary experience whether it's your destination, your departure point, or a hub for transfers.",0
"All these positive reviews?  Huh.  Well, people give Southwest's cockroach-infested planes high marks, too, so it's all a matter of taste I suppose. No, this a not a place you want to find yourself after 9pm.  Nor before 9pm.  I'd heard bad things from friends who fly through here frequently, but I was still disappointed.\n\nMy flight arrives at 9:15 or so, and I'm already unhappy because a poor corporate travel agent didn't tell me that \""""direct\"""" flights are not always \""""non-stop\"""" flights and that while I had only one plane to SFO, I had to get off it at least once during the return. So I arrive and deplane so they can move the Airbus to another gate (?), and since there's a 90 minute layover, I go in search of food and drink. \n\nFirst, I sense the skeeviness. It couldn't have smelled like stale cigarettes in the terminal (no smoking!), yet somehow I felt it did.  Maybe it was the beige decor, straight out of 1974, and the dingy looking carpet. The design was like the old sections of O'Hare or Dulles--all narrow halls, low ceilings, and backlit Helvetica signage with (perhaps) dead bugs stuck between the light bulbs and the plastic lenses.  I approach the first small food court, and hear the rumble of closing gates.  Done for the night.  \n\nAh, the hot dog place is still open!   \n\n\""""Hi!\"""" \n\""""Sorry, we close at 9:30.\"""" \n\""""It's 9:15!\"""" \n\""""We close at 9:30.\""""\n*Rumble* *Slam!*\n\nLet's try the next terminal.  At the crossroads between A's and B's, I see moving walkways heading in two directions, but there's no airport map.  Call home.  Get advice. Check the internet. Ponder the consequences.  Head toward the A's, since that's where my plane will end up in an hour.  Take one walkway.  Take another walkway. A new concourse appears over the horizon.  \n\n*Rumble* *Rumble* *Slam!* \n\nCrap.\n\nThere's some activity at the end of the concourse, and I see some kind of Tequila-themed bar. Seating!  Non-chain Mexican food!  People!  I walk in, sit down, pick up a menu from a pile on the bar, look around for service.\n\n*Waitress approaches*\n\n\""""Hi! Can I have a...\""""\n\n*Waitress pulls menu out of my hands, returns it to the pile, straightens the pile with obvious annoyance*\n\n*With back turned* \""""No more food.  Drinks.\"""" \n\nI get up and walk out, and see a crowd forming at the California Pizza Kitchen.  Something!  An Ethiopian family is capitalizing on the food shortage and the pizzas are flying in and out of the faux-wood oven. Short wait. I order.\n\n\""""Four cheese, please. Thanks for staying open!\""""\n\n\""""Hey man, people keep paying, I keep making pizzas.\""""\n\nI get my pizza, take it to the food court, and eat while a crew cleans up around me, eventually putting a chair up on to the other end of the table I'm eating at.  Still a hour until my flight goes, and there were at least 3 or 4 flights leaving an hour or more after that.  Can we relax a bit?  The pizza guy keeps cranking 'em out, and the latest customers are just standing around shoveling slices directly from the box for lack of a place to sit.  A soda fountain, affiliated with some other fast food joint and clearly disgusted by the scene, makes a rude noise and spontaneously expels several gallons of water onto the floor. It runs down a slight slope to soak a large section of beige carpet. I'll bet that'll smell nice tomorrow.\n\nI leave the food area and walk toward my gate, looking forward to sitting on plastic and vinyl benches for the next 55 minutes.  As I walk past the Tequila place, the bartender bellows:\n\n\""""OK, people!  Time to head out.  You don't have to go home but you can't stay here!\""""\n\nReal clever.  Christ, we're barracaded inside a plasterboard-and-carpet box, hundreds or thousands of miles from home, locked in by low-paid contractors with guns anxious to perform some more Security Theatre, waiting for delayed and cancelled flights. Sorry we're inconveniencing you.\n\nWell, at least I got a whole row to myself on both legs of the flight. Maybe that's a benefit of flying through a shitty airport.",0
"This airport blows. Why?\n\n- The car rental place is too far away - and it's a complete shitshow. \n- There are no ATM machines once you get past security. \n- Security is insane. The lines are way too long, the workers are way too cranky. It reminded me of the security lines at Vegas - except  without the benefit of just coming from a weekend filled with gambling, drugs and hookers (well, for most people anyway, for me it was EXACTLY like coming back from a weekend in Vegas). \n\nThe not-too-bad parts?\n\n- Free Wi-Fi\n- If you're waiting to meet friends, there are decent eating/drinking choices outside of security",0
"It's a nice roomy place with a smelly carpet but the chairs are uncomfortable for sleeping if you get stuck there.  I stayed there for 2 weeks once in the winter when I couldn't get a flight out.   No hot water in toilets, which usually stink of sweaty perverts and farts.  Food is awful fast junk $$$, etc, & you are in the middle of nowhere unless you drove or have a uni-cycle in your pack.  \n\nYou have people sleeping in nooks & corners who got stuck there.  The con artist crooks on the prowl looking for dumb people who overpacked & are wearing an i-pod radio.  The snooty plastic people who came from Vegas, with the \""""look at me, I'm so rich\"""" attitude pulling their doofy luggage w/ a mini poodle tucked into a plastic bag.  The \""""yelling\"""" people who eventually broke down & couldn't take it anymore.  Yeah, this place is hell alright.\n\nYou fly into one terminal then have to hike 2 miles away to another terminal and your plane leaves in 15 mins.\n\nCustomer service is absent from everyone you encounter from ticket sales, to security, to janitors.  They walk around with a \""""fuck you\"""" look on their faces.\n\nYou drive around for hours because you can't turn around or stop because rent a security hollers at you to keep moving.  Of course, then there's the moronic homeland security, aka \""""morons without a clue\"""" who x-ray you, fondle you, and butt search you for 2 hours just to get thru the bloody gate.  It takes another 20 minutes just to put on each garment you had to remove, including your underpants.  Don't bother the dumb cops, they'll choke you to death for no reason.  They ride a bicycle inside, on the carpet, what jerks.  \n\nPlus, if you look like a foreigner you have to deal with the idiot Border Patrol.\n\nIf coming in from abroad, you'll stand about 4 hrs in line, then get the bored, rude idiot, who does nothing but stamp your passport and asks if you brought \""""weed\"""" in & tries to ask \""""trick questions\"""" like what high school you went to & who was president at the time.  Only Americans would know that.\n\nAfter all that's done, you can get on the small, smelly plane with a bunch of rude, inconsiderate jerks & get the last seat in the back by the clogged toilet.  But hey, at least you made it alive.  Look forward to the annoying \""""free drink time\"""" by the rejected models who are so stuck up & the turbulence out by Kansas.\n\nBeats the Los Angeles Airport or taking Greyhound just barely, tho.",0
"In the style of Ignatius J. Reilly \n\nThis city is famous for  its pablum strip mall culture, its tweaked city-vagrants, Antichrist shadeless palms, artificial tans, frauds with transfixed hairstyles, fetishists in stilettos, sodomites, drug addicts, exhibitionists, internet punchers, and litterbugs, all of whom are too reconciled by the lagniappe.  \n\nIf you have a moment, I shall endeavor to discuss the portion of this shambles that makes up for the dissident of its surroundings, Sky Harbor Airport which i bothered to scribe into my Big Chief Tablet during my last expedition to fairer country.\n\nIt is rather fine.  It is not only clean, but impeccable.  The staff is quite firm on the rules, which I was not made aware that a lute may pass through their customs, but not my British Honduran macaw or Belizian soy nuts.  Ho hum.  I had to insert them into the bowel of the plane, which is right where I told the wanded lady to stick her apparatus. \n\nI wandered up into Terminal Four, exceedingly the only port worth venturing from, with its hoards of awful fat inducing foods that I would never let my indulgences approach.  So, I had several plates of Chili Cheese Fries and four bloody marrys at Fox Sports Grill to block my urge from any of the other filth this corporate consortium of overfed Americana bestows on its citizens.  Filth!  Not me.  No way would I indulge here.  \n\nThough Terminal Four is quite a pleasant atmosphere, and allow myself to reiterate, the best port of exit, there is a severe mass of human activity.  If you are like myself, you won't enjoy the egregious offense against good reading at all of the newstands and boutique book shops around the mall area.  The \""""Somebody in Arizona Loves Me\"""" apparel is without shame entirely!\n\nStill, if I must leave my beautiful burg in the sun, I enjoy the comforts of this guttersnipe and bawb babble infested airport.  Its just slightly above ho hum.  But only a just little.",1
"Free Internet in the Southwest Terminal. Big comfy chairs and lots of them. CNN with the sound on. A Wendy's that sells Frosty's. But really, this airport is a 5 just for the free wireless.",1
"I can't say anything bad about Sky Harbor International Airport as I was only here as a stopover from Mexico to Detroit. I really wish I had known the TSA rule about checking Duty-free liquid purchases when making connecting flights.  I barely had room in my suitcase for the 980ml bottle of Kahlua I bought.  I sure as hell wasn't leaving that behind!\n\nAlso, upon my return I found a note in my bag that said I had randomly been selected by TSA for a baggage check.  They sliced open the bubble wrap around my Kahlua (also sliced the label).  Luckily, my contents were not soaked in the stuff...everything was ok except i believe my book I was reading on the beach that was in the front pocket of my suitcase fell out during their inspection.  Not a huge loss as my friend back home had a copy to lend me.\n\nIs Sky Harbor \""""America's Friendliest Airport\""""?  I can't answer that, but it is much better than most.\n\nOh yeah, I love the blue agave cacti that you can see out the window as you ride the people mover through the terminal.  Nice touch, AZ!",1
"I liked the old airport better.  I hate large, hard to navigate, walk forever to get to your gate airports.  My parents and I once didn't find each other till an hour after I landed because it was so big and confusing.  My parents always hated that there was ALWAYS construction going on there and it kept changing so you could never be sure the route you took one time would work the next time you went.  It was almost easier to just drive there from San Diego than to fly.",0
"I love how people review the airport... like you even have much of a choice if you want to come to Phoenix or leave here for somewhere too far to drive. \n\nAirports in general suck - they always have. Since you-know-when, they've definitely kicked up the suck to a spectacular degree. I mean, I look back to pre-you-know-when days of flying as the good-old-days. I wish you could still meet people at the gates without a ticket. Hell, I wish you could get in the fucking airport without having to remove your shoes. \n\nHonestly, I'm willing to risk the occasional plane hijack in exchange for being able to not feel personally violated just because I wanna travel. It seriously factors in to my decisions to travel - the flying... more specifically, the airport. If someone really wanted to - they could still easily take over a flight or kill people on a plane or even crash it into a building. It's probably easier to take over a plane today than it is to hijack a taxi cab or a bus or break into someone's house. And yet we agree to surrender our 4 ounces of shampoo and nail clippers - like I can fucking attack someone with nail clippers. Fuck you.\n\nSky Harbor is like any other airport. They have some decent bars and it can make for some interesting people watching. As many times as I've been to this airport to pick up or drop off, I still have anxiety about navigating around it - it's not that bad, but it still sucks. I'll say it's just slightly less obnoxious than waiting in line for Mr. Toad's Wild Ride at Disneyland. \n\nOne time I was picking someone up - had them on the cell phone. They had their suitcase and were ready to meet me outside - I asked which side they wanted to meet me on and they said South, so I pulled up to the curb to wait for them to walk right out. It wasn't busy at all either, mind you. I was there for not even two seconds when some old fuck tells me to keep moving. I pointed to the door and said the person was coming out and he yelled at me to move along and drive around. He even put his hands on my car to tell me again - I said \""""fuck, fine... \"""" and pulled forward. He comes to my door and says I tried to run him over and starts taking my license plate. What?! I wish I had run him over. \n\nAnyway - this airport is just as annoying as all airports are... unless you know of one where they don't give you a cavity search when you want to go to Hawaii. I am honestly not worried at all about terrorists. I feel no safer and no less safe now than I did in 2000. I would feel just as safe if they let us bring samurai swords and shotguns on board. I can rest just fine knowing the guy next to me might have 4 ounces of hair gel rather than 3. I'm more worried about what kinds of lice and shit live inside the pillows and blankets on the planes (they rarely clean them just so you know - only when the plane is serviced if at all).\n\nYou don't need to xray my bag or boot up my laptop. I'm not hiding a switchblade or a bomb in my shoe. I don't care if anyone else is. If I die, I die. That's the risk I take. It's a miracle enough the fucking things stay in the sky considering Airlines let these things fly when they're held together by duct tape. I've tried to duct tape a pair of shoes and they didn't even last for 2 hours of light walking.\n\nHey, the events of you-know-when were tragic... whether you believe it was an inside job or a straight up act of anti-American hate-fueled terrorism, I think we've suffered enough already. I say we lighten up on it. More people have probably died from second hand smoke they inhaled while on routine red-eye business class flights than have ever died from hijackings.",0
"Sky Harbor is as big as the Sky. There is nothing convenient about this airport, and if I actually have to go to Phoenix, I would rather drive there then have to fly there.\n\nThe gates are also far apart (read: just McCarran, because desert begs to be used). There are no rental cars anywhere close, which is amazing, because the airport is located in the middle of the city. The Enterprise rental car location is at least three miles away, which alone tells you how ill conceived this airport is.\n\nLast time I was there, the airport was on fire. Or maybe it was a few times back. And to add to the misery, I was usually flying American West through here.",0
Why do airports have to be SO fucked up? I mean just to pick someone up is like this huge undertaking.. you of course have all the stupid people driving 2 miles an hour to find their loved one.. then you have the selfish pricks who wont let you over.. so maybe I should be Yelping asshole Phoenix drivers rather then the airport but I wouldn't have dealt with them if the airport layout would have been more conducive for drop off and pick up. Its a real cluster fuck over there!,0
"I have to say, Yelpers. We have it pretty good in Phoenix!\n\nI fly a LOT. Over the last year, I've taken about  dozen business trips - a few of them multi-leg. In 2007 I took just over 20 trips. So, hardly a month goes by where I'm not flying. I spend a LOT of time at airports all over the country.\n\nWhen people talk about Sky Harbor, they mostly mean terminals 3 and 4. 2 is primarily international. \n\n4 is the newer of the terminals. 3 is older, but still not bad. Southwest and US Airways use Terminal 4, both of which are popular airlines in AZ.\n\nEither of them are pretty good compared to many other cities. Especially terminal 4 which is crowded but plush by airport standards.\n\nFree wifi. Plenty of AC power plugs for laptops and other devices. Lots of dining options - both behind and in front of the security checkpoint. Clean and plentiful bathrooms. \n\nSometimes the security line is long. Sometimes it isn't. It isn't the airports fault - they are all manned by the same idiot TSA employees, no matter the airport. The airport doesn't hire these mouth breathers, only the Federal Government is capable of hiring incompetents on such a massive scale. :) And they hire the false security guards for every airport. They'll give you and granny a body cavity search while the guy in the Osama bin Ladin t-shirt or whatever goes right through. Oh well!\n\nThe luggage pick up areas are easy to navigate. The airport is clean. There are lots of parking options. We have the largest car rental lot in the country. If you're waiting to pick someone up and you're early, look for the 'cell phone lot' signs, and hang there until your visitor shows up and calls. It's right next to the pick up area. \n\nI mean- compare it to other airports. JFK? JFK is a dirty shithole with a serious mouse problem. O'Hare is a running joke. San Diego - all best dining options are outside the security gate. WTF?",1
Least favorite airport in the U.S.\n\nPain in the ass to navigate.  And that's all that really matters. Everything else is the same anywhere.  \n\nBut PHX's crappiness doesn't really matter since you don't have a choice anyway. So what is the effing point in reviewing an airport?!  I'll tell you what the point is--I effing have insomnia and writing crappy reviews on Yelp while halfway awake is the only thing I can think of to do in the middle of the night. Cuz I'm tired of watching midgets selling real estate secrets and Joe Francis selling titty videos.\n\nP.S. I'd give PHX 1 star but it has a dog park and a Paradise Bakery.,0
"So I fly on average twice a month. I'll start off by saying that it's all about which Terminal you use. If you're travelling Southwest or US Airways, you will unfortunately have to use Terminal 4. While it is the new and largest Terminal, it is also the busiest....by FAR!!!!! I can never accurately predict how busy it will be. On any random Friday, I can expect a LONG, SLOW security line-especially when I'm running late. I still fail to understand how they will only man 2 of the 3 i.d check stations when the lines are long......and don't get me started on the security and x-ray stations. I got to experience the awesome new airport in Singapore and thinking about while in line at Terminal 4 at Sky Harbor almost makes me cry every time.\n\nWhere this terminal is the best is in the choice of food and drinks. This is where Terminal 4 shines. They close early though, so if you're leaving after 8:00pm, forget about a drink, Pizza Slut or Cinnabon.\nTerminal 2 is quite the opposite-fast and easy to check-in and get past security. It is a BREEZE and about as stress free as you can get in the U.S. The flip side is that there is ONE bar and it is lame. So there is absolutely nothing to do with the spare time you have, having anticipated that security was going to take forever after experiencing Terminal 4. \nSo to sum up, Terminal 4 has lots of bars and food venues that you WON'T be able to experience because it took so long to get through security. And as stressed as you are after security, it really sucks because you'll NEED a drink-but your flight's leaving in 6 minutes.\nYou will probably be relaxed with time to kill if you use Terminal 2, but HOW you kill that time is going to be problematic.",0
"It's a good airport with a cool name.  Sky Harbor.  I haven't actually sailed on out of there, as airport security is what it is. However, you've got Free Wi-Fi Internet.  Free Cell Phone parking lots.  Free Starbucks.  Ok, I'm kidding there.  But compared to Seattle, you're not going in circles, you're driving in ovals, so it's somehow less dizzying and clear.  In fact, it's relatively painless in terms of maneuvering, even with construction.  Compared to Detroit, the renovation work needed is not way overdue.  Also, did I mention it has a cool name?",1
"Not much to see here, really.  I only spent time in Terminal 3 as that's where Delta is.  OK, The Sopwith Camel was cool. Same thing with the plaster, Disneyesque fake rockface underneath it.  I appreciated the free Wi-Fi, even if you didn't have power outlets available. (Or if you did, I didn't see any in that nook next to Starbucks.)  But two huge negatives haunt me.  First, the entire having to go through security to reach your terminal thing sucks.  What I mean by that is, instead of going through a single TSA line and then having access to multiple options once you get past the checkpoint, you go through the line and then only have access to the options near your gate and only near your gate.  This is a major criterion on which I judge airports because if, say, you're flying a red-eye and every option in that particular terminal is closed, then you have to go through security multiple times.  I realize that there are other terminals, since it isn't obvious how to actually GET to the other terminals (unlike Atlanta's underground train), you're on an island.  Which leads me to my second complaint.\n\nEverything was freaking closed!  Yeah, I was taking a redeye, but at 10pm on a Friday, I expected at least ONE thing open.  (And not just the Starbucks.)  Maybe there are other terminals with options catering to a later crowd, but I fly Delta and, had I not packed a couple granola bars, the flight would've sucked more than normal.  So to people who decry Atlanta Hartsfield's gargantuan size, imagine the other option...an option where Wendy's and some random burrito place sit, darkened and mocking your hungry, hungry ass.\n\nTwo stars.",0

"I have always had comfortable and easy experiences at Sky Harbor in the past, but I must say I had the best experience at the PHX airport last week which really topped it all off!\n\nTraveling at Thanksgiving time is not for the faint of heart with long lines, pushy people, and lots of crying children everywhere. Not once did I see the staff at Sky Harbor even grimace. Everyone I encountered was so genuinely friendly and helpful, from the rental car shuttle driver, to the TSA agents, to the counter workers. I forgot to remove my liquids from my carry-on (gasp!) and the agent who inspected my bag did so quickly and sent me on my way with a \""""Happy Thanksgiving!\"""" I have had similar issues at airports in the past where a simple search may turn into an ordeal.

Two walking sidewalks apart just from the end of one to the start of the next one. I'm healthy enough to walk the distance without problem... but with luggage in tow it gets a bit old. Heaven forbid you have a quick connection. \n\nPhoenix is, however, a phenomenal shoppers paradise.

"As far as gluten-free eating, this airport is TERRIBLE!  We were \""""trapped\"""" in this airport for over 10 hours and searched it from end to end.  The best that I could do (to prevent starvation) was to attempt to eat at the Fox Sports Lounge.

"I like our airport, I think it is pretty nice. \n\nThis is about security which I guess is a part of the airport. \n\nIt is getting tiring. \n\nOld prune faced woman snarking at you, tiring. \n\nSay you have an artificial leg, you get the honor of being pulled aside. OK fine check the leg, but for God sake what is with this wiping the hands down and then the leg. I never see anyone else getting there hands wiped. If you do not find a bomb attached to the leg, leave the hands alone and lets just get on with it. \n\nReally gets tiring for a people who travel a lot.",0
"If you haven't travelled much, you'll definitely be impressed by this airport. Your experience will likely be heavily dependant on whether you are coming in or flying out. If you are coming in, the whole pick up situation can be pretty frustrating because there is no waiting area for your ride, so they will have to either park or continue to circle the airport until you are out. Baggage seems to take an incredibly long time here, and I don't quite understand why because they only have one claim. It's all going to the same place... anyways, if you are flying out you probably will think it's a great airport.",0
"Pluses: \n-Good central location, as opposed to some airports that are quite far away from the city they serve. \n-Easy to get out of if you are being picked up at the curb (although driving through the airport is a slow process)\n-Rental car facility is fairly new and quite spacious, but...\n\nMinuses: \n-Rental car parking facility is far far away. The shuttle bus to go from the rental facility to the terminal is 12-15 minutes, so plan accordingly for your outgoing flight.\n-Baggage check and Security lines can be quite long, especially at the SW terminal (C) in the morning. Here's a tip -- if the Gate C security line is very long, try the Gate D entrance. You will have to walk over to C but the reduced wait should make it worth it.",0

Super fast on the baggage claim pickup. Clean, nice, easy, fast, effective. All the things I would 'crave' in an airport if I ever really stopped to think about it (thanks Yelp!).\n\nSJC, take some hints.",1
A pain to get in and out of. I dread each trip I have to take to this place.,0
"granted there really isn't another good choice for flying into phoenix, but if there was, i'd take it!  truly flying in and out of sky harbor has been a trying experience at best- and my home airport is LUV, people... not great either.  my last trip i was hospitalized the week prior and i was being wheeled through security, bandages on my face, jammies bespotted with old blood, baggie of pills in my lap, complete with a doctor's note.  they took away my wheelchair and my PRESCRIPTION cream to keep my scars from drying out.  when one of my prescription bottles fell out of the baggie and rolled to their side of the table they wouldn't let me have it back- i said that i needed it and they told me they could do what they want, including having me arrested for arguing with them and they asked if i was on anything... uh, duh!  my mother was struggling with the bags and trying to keep me standing; other people in the line spoke up and said they were being ridiculous- they were told they didn't want to get involved or they could be detained.  then they lost interest with me.  i had to walk to my gate, which was, of course, as far away as possible, and this proves difficult when you are drugged up and now crying as much as drooling- the drooling wasn't their fault so much as the surgery, but we'll say it was:)\n\nall that aside, the rental car situation... while being away from the terminals is good for steering away traffic, the cars are so far away you really need to plan ahead.  and the shuttles are not as frequent as they could be. \n\n(other than that, i love phoenix!)",0
"Ok, let's try to kill two hours layover on PHX. It is dull and boring. You are hungry and want to find something healthy. I checked three terminals (!) for fresh fruits - nada. Only fast food, and even the chains (like Quiznos, etc) only have a limited selection. There is a bar/ diner with different theme in every terminal. Choice of 5 sandwiches - exactly the same in every single one. Errh. I settled with a fajita-bowl-whatever from a mexican joint, which was the single most disgusting fajita-anything I have ever had. Where is the second star coming from? Looks like they disinfect the bathrooms and they have a free public wireless network, which allows me to write this review live and outraged.

"This is just for the service at the US Airways ticket counter. I had to share.\nMy grandmother, bless her heart, wanted to buy my ticket with her flyer miles. On Friday night we arrived at the ticket counter and they appeared to be closed. Though I believe that we went to the wrong counter. We vowed to come back at six the next morning and by golly I was up at 5:22 a.m.\n\nI'm not a happy morning person so I'm quite asleep. My grandmother is awake and on a mission. We pay $4 for parking and walk up to the ticket counter, no line, no waiting. Things are looking pretty good.\n\nMy grandmother says she wants to buy a ticket for me using her flyer miles. The ticket lady looks at us and asks us if we had made a reservation.\n\""""What, we have to make a reservation to come to the airport and buy a ticket?\""""\nMy grandmother is irritated with the lady and it hasn't even been 2 minutes. She doesn't let this show, but I can feel it.\n\nI tell her I need a ticket from Phoenix to Dublin and I tell her Sept. 15.\n\""""Booked,\"""" she replies.\n\""""Well, try the sixteenth.\""""\n\""""Booked.\""""\n\""""The fourteenth?\""""\n\""""Booked.\""""\n\""""Try everything from the thirteenth to the twenty-first.\""""\n\""""Booked, booked, booked, booked, booked, booked, booked, booked, booked.\""""\n\""""Really?

I found round trip tickets from $768 and one-ways for $459.\""""\n\""""That's a really good deal you should probably go with that if you can get it.\""""\n\""""Well, how much is a one-way ticket for Aer Lingus on the 15th of Sept.?\""""\n\""""$2,000.\""""\n\nI was afraid that my grandmother was going to have a heart attack. She gasped and stood there with her mouth open. We walked upstairs and sat at a table to call the flight fund people that were supposed to make a reservation for us and magically bestow the flyer miles.\nAfter giving the guy on the phone her life story for computer input on his end he asks, \""""So where is your grand-daughter going?\""""\n\""""From Phoenix to Dublin.\""""\n\""""Ma'am I'm sorry this is US only. I'll have to transfer you to our international department.\""""\n\nI sit and stare at the people walking through the airport at this ungodly hour (for me anyway.)\nNow she is talking to a woman in the international sector for the miles.\nThe woman asks what my return date is and my grandmother tells her that the ticket is one-way. I am going for school for a year and have no idea when I will be back.\nThe woman kindly informs us that unless I am a citizen of the UK I can not get a one-way ticket to Ireland by using flyer miles. But I can get a round trip ticket and then just change the date for a fee of $275! And also to do that my grandmother is 20,000 miles short, she only has 30,000 miles which would have been enough for the one-way ticket.\n\nMy grandmother asks how much would it be to just buy the 20,000 miles and the woman on the other end tells her that it would probably cost as much, if not more, than buying a regular ticket.\n\""""Well how much is a regular round trip ticket?\""""\nMy grandmother turns white as a ghost. She is breathless as her mouth hangs wide open. I am afraid her heart actually did stop.\nShe looks at me as she writes the figure on the paper in front of her.\n$4,798.\n\nI tell her to hang up. We are going home and I'm going on the internet.\nI bought a one-way ticket from Phoenix to Dublin leaving on Sept. 15th for $530.\nFunnier yet, I actually got the ticket for the two airlines the ticket lady said was either booked or expensive... US Airways and Aer Lingus.\nThank you Priceline.com.",0
"I do fly frequently and I am not really a fan of PHX. Where do I start? Driving to the airport is easy. It is centrally located and I would rate it high in the convience department. After that, it's downhill. I don't park there -  I use a shuttle service such as the Parking Spot and get dropped off right out front. Much easier. Inside the terminals are good, most of the times the lines move, although why people cannot figure out how to use the self check kiosks, I don't know. It isn't rocket science. Security lines are rarely long and move quickly, but once inside you are stuck with limited services. Sure there are stores and Dick Clark's on the outside, but be prepared to fly hungry or wait in long lines on the inside. I fly Delta a lot and in terminal 3 you have a choice of Wendy's or the blue burrito...or vending machines...maybe pick up something at the newsstand...\n\nFor me the major issues are driving through the airport. The terminals are not user friendly. They are adequately marked 1-4 and have north side and south side. When picking up someone ask which door number they are coming out of - because you cannot stop long. Once the wheels on the bus stop going round and round security emerges as if by magic to instruct you to keep moving. Sit there and ignore them long enough and the ticket book appears - that's when it;s time to circle again (thanks, Bin Laden). Terminal three has one inconvenient turn while you are waiting for emerging traffic during your continual loop of the terminal - I have almost been t-boned a few times there. Another thing I don't like is their short term parking - it appears instantly and goes up a ramp. It is always in a spot I am not thinking it should be, so I miss it. Instead use the cell phone lot and wait for your party to call, circle around and take your chances with security.\n\nOn a positive note, the airport is a great place to people watch. I always follow the guideline of 2 hours early, so I get to sit and watch. People hanging in the bar getting drunk and forgetting they are flying when their name is paged, people late and OJ'ing it through the concourse, people wearing interesting outfits and being an international airport, you can see people from all over the world. Not to mention the occassional disruptions - is it a wonder SouthWest made a reality show about people in the airport? If you don't mind being hungry and bored, arrive early and watch the people. Some of them are worth the price of a ticket!",0
"Just flew out of the Phoenix airport... no really, I'm sitting on the plane, bored and Yelping.  I'll post this tomorrow...\n\nSky Harbor Int'l Airport is a nice lil big airport that has some friendly features that are nice for convenience.  First off, all the arrivals don't have to cluster around 1 passenger pick-up area.  Phoenix airport has a north, south, east and west curb for pick-up.  Next, their signs for passengers waiting for a ride are clearly marked so you know your terminal, area and curb while you wait.  Next, their security was a breeze... but maybe I just timed my trip right.  And finally... are you ready for this... I bought an nice cold bottled water for... wait for it... under 2$.  No, I'm not kidding.\n\nOnly minor irritation is that some of the bathroom latches don't latch well.  Grrr. (North Curb bathroom specifically)  LoL\n\nThis is one airport I don't mind so much.  According to Ron L. though, it seems like it's improved much over the years, so I'm glad to be visiting it now.\n\nSee ya there!",1
"I don't care for this airport. It's ugly (it's no YVR) and the food choices aren't great (it's no Narita - I'm partial to that Japanese food there), BUT it has FREE wi-fi, and for that I am always glad to connect through Phoenix. \n\nPlus it never seems to be crowded when I'm laying over there. I can roam around and find a seat with an outlet by it fairly easily. \n\nI don't know about the other parts of the airport, and again I don't care. The free wi-fi gets it a full five.",1
"I've never checked in at this airport, restricted entirely to layovers. What stands out, however, is how many fellow fliers I spend time with complain about the check-in service and security. I don't know what's going on from that side, but I hear it time and again.\n\nFrom my side, I can't help but notice that I have to change gates nearly every flight thru there. Since I'm usually sleeping, I've been lucky to wake up shortly before the announcement with time to make the gate-change. As has been noted in other reviews, the terminals are far apart and gate changes can be rather drastic.\n\nOne big positive is the lack of arm rests on the seats. This makes it real easy for a peep to catch up on some quality nappage. There are also a lot of places to eat or drink at, all with the standard airport mark-up but with at least some variety. This 'port makes for an acceptable layover, but I've so far been able to avoid checking in here and suggest the same.",0
"An airport in the US with free wifi is a rare find, so Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport definitely deserves 5 stars for this potentially life-saving service. At my terminal, there was a sports bar with college football on TV, a Starbucks and usable restrooms.\n\nAlthough my layover flight was delayed about 20 minutes, I was completely fine with it. My friend who got delayed at DFW Airport was less than lucky.",1
"Almost as bad as Oakland.  Constant gate changes (and the terminals are not anywhere close to each other).  We flew there headed to Puerto Vallarta and our gate changed twice - from B to A and then back to B.  Fortunately, there was a long layover.  On the way back it changed twice in B and then to A - we almost didn't make our flight.\n\nSecurity takes forever.  They pull over the single brown man to double check his bag.  They allow first class passengers to bypass the security line, holding everyone else up.  Then they allow people in wheelchairs to bypass the line (which is very understandable, but why do they only have two x-ray lines open?). \n\nThere are tons of grouchy older people there.  I like old people, but the grouch/entitlement level was comperable to Dulles.  People are freaking rude.\n\nIt is NOT the friendliest airport anywhere - unless you compare it to Oakland.  Compared to Oakland, it's not so bad, but I still won't be flying through Phoenix again.",0
"Be thankful Phoenixites, most US Airports don't have free wifi. PHX is a great little-big airport. I say \""""little-big\"""" because the airport has a small feel to me, which I like. It's not little at all, of course, it's just really easy to get in and out.\n\nSome gates are really dark, with only a few windows. It's a shame, too because this airport has great views of the mountain reserves surrounding Phoenix and Scottsdale. The trade off is a fair one: you won't be burning hot during the summer while you sit waiting to board that 1:00pm flight. At the end of each terminal (the last few gates) is large with windows all around. Excellent views.\n\nEvery time I visit it seems like they're under construction/adding on, but I can't complain since my home is Houston Intercontinental which has a similar growing problem (if you consider growth a problem!)",1
"Plus's  - Free WiFi, no arms on seats.\n\nMinus's - Long distance between terminals. Bus service between terminals slow. Have to go thru security again between terminals. Security checkpoints REALLY slow. Three columns for going thru security, regular coach, first class, parents w/children and wheelchairs. What this means is that for regular coach passengers it takes more than a half hour to get thru the damn security screening checkpoint so Good Luck if you're trying to catch a flight in another terminal.\n\n  Also, hardly any screens that show flight/gate information. If it's not on your boarding pass or if your boarding pass gate # is wrong, good luck finding what gate you're supposed to be on.",0
"After arriving it is a pain to get the rent a car because they are located off site, and you have cross a few lanes of traffic to get to the bus pick-up. Every time I have flown in there have been long lines for the bus. Ride is about 10 minutes and if you don't get GPS you have to drive past terminals to return -- complete pain in the a**.\n\nIt is also very confusing to get picked up due to door on each side of baggage claim.\n\nOn the return (outbound trip) security can be a pain when flying AA. They are in an old terminal (no Admirals Club) and there is no \""""premiere\"""" line. After cleaning security there is only 1 sandwich shop and 1 crappy little bar.\n\nThe gates themselves are old and run down.\n\nI do remember the SWA gates being nicer........",0
Yes they do have free wifi.\n\nThey also have wierd booze laws that require everyone to be carded but don't require booze prices on the menu. It's quite a shock when a Bud costs $8.50. WTF???\n\nThe food is pretty bad and is all shut down by 9pm. Goodnight sleepy PHX!,0
"For a really sunny place, this airport is very dark; the drop off point looks old and dark, the check in counters are dark (except for the lighting, of course). Is it to shield from the intense sun? It might be kinda nice to leverage the sun a little?\n\nAnyway. What really scared me were the BIRDS in the Southwest terminal. The staff seemed to think that it was funny to have a swarm of sparrows flittering around in the waiting area. Disgusting and Dirty. \n\nOtherwise, adequate airport, pretty fast lines and ok food choices",0
"Flew out to Phoenix for a company kickoff.\n\nWhat I liked:\n-pretty friendly staff at security\n-well-organized monitors for departures/arrivals and for baggage claim\n-free WI-FI, woohoo!\n-Cinnabon, TCBY, and Fox Sports Grill next to eachother; perfect grub for my 2 hrs in the terminal\n-great flora and cacti, always makes me think of this old-school Nickelodeon show:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6TFo5GukGk\n\nWhy no fifth star:\n-bit of a lengthy and confusing drive to drop off folks in DEPARTURES\n-watch out for the north,south, & east directions",1
"If not one of the ugliest airports in the US certainly one of the most  depressing. In desperate need of some renovations, especially the outcast terminal 2 home to united & continental.  Driving around and out of the terminals can be a bit tricky and you may end up doing a few laps if you miss your exit.  Also, getting a rental car offsite can test your patience.  However, the short and long term parking lots are convenient and fairly inexpensive.\n\nAnd if you are in need of 1,000+ new pieces of luggage or some free stuff swing by the baggage claim and help yourself.",0
"Big, sprawling, very crowded and disorderly. On the upside, I'll guess weather isn't a factor here.",0
"I fly - a lot - and I have to say that Sky Harbor is one of the better airports in the country. It's one of the highest volume airports yet it's reasonably well organized. I've heard that about 75% of the air traffic flows through Terminal 4 (that's where US Air and SouthWest fly out of). \n\nIf you've going to fly out of Phoenix very often my advice would be to start using US Air or SouthWest because a) it's a hub for both of them and b) you'll have much better flight choices and c) because of the competition, the prices tend to be better. The other terminals, by comparison, are nearly deserted. Terminals 2 and 3 have very limited food choices. Terminal 4 has improved a lot in that regard. \n\nThere is a lot of parking available, both on site and off site. The off site parking, naturally, is cheaper but you have to wait for the buses to bring you to the terminal. Compared to other airports of comparable size the on site parking is not that expensive. If it's a business trip and you are getting reimbursed for the parking, just park on site and save yourself the hassle. Honestly, the best way to get in and out of Sky Harbor is not to drive at all but to use a transportation service. I'm not talking about Stupper-Shuttle - don't get me started on them - but a real sedan service that will drop you at the curb and meet you at the security gate when you arrive back home. \n\nIf you can, print your boarding pass at home rather than waiting in line at the airport. The airline clubs, in my view, are a waste of money. As another reviewer pointed out, the wi-fi access is now free at Sky Harbor. I used to belong to the US Air club but let it lapse. The snacks are not that good, they were charging for drinks. Unless you are regularly connecting through Phoenix how much time are you really going to spend in the airport? Now if you're connecting and have a long layover then it might be worthwhile but otherwise I'd skip it. \n\nI got a laptop stolen here once so a word about security. If you have a laptop computer, put it through the x-ray machine last and don't take your eye off it for a moment. Particularly if it's very busy.",1
"This airport is a joke.\n\nSo there's one level for both departures and arrivals?  I can only imagine how cluttered this place becomes during peak-hours.  Once you're inside, you realize arrivals go upstairs and each terminal has their security checkpoint.  Why is this so complicated?  And the North Curb and South Curb?  Why?\n\nThe whole place, inside and out, appears to be very cluttered.  Maybe I'm just spoiled by spending many years at JFK and LGA.",0
"Been in this airport about 100 times and each time I have a good experience. Free WiFi with many places to plug in your laptop, quick security lines, and smooth baggage claim make this one of my favorite airports west of the Mississippi. \n\nA quick note: This airport is huge, so if you have some time to kill before your flight, you will have no problem entertaining yourself here.",1
"I think this airport is not my favorite at all.  I think it is because the service is not really good.  You pretty much have to take a shuttle for a rent a car which is not close which is 10 minutes away for the shuttle in boonie land. So make sure you arrive early.  Hmm the people that work there are rude and the luggage on the chart really is slow. Took them 30 minutes to actually get the lugguage out there and onto the carosel.  Also, the security is slow. I remember they had only one openng and it went by really slow.  Then 50 minutes later when the line was jammed back, they opened up another line, but when I got there it was alreay too late. I never ate the food there, but anyways not my favorite to go to.",0
"So much for \""""America's Friendliest Airport\"""".\n\nSo I admit, I reluctantly allowed myself to be shipped off to AZ post-immigration legislation fiasco, so I was not thrilled to be there at all, BUT whatever - it was for work, and well, it is what it is.\n\nI had to snicker just a tad when I read the logo at the airport - I guess when they meant that they're the \""""friendliest\"""", they surely could not have meant their Gestapo-like TSA agents at the security checkpoint or the chick at the airline counter who yelled at EVERY SINGLE PERSON who walked up to her before she called them over, \""""WAIT!!! I'M NOT DONE!!\"""" (I won't mention the airline, being that it's my airline of choice) -- so, yeah.  If the interaction with Security sucked, and so did the experience at the airline counter, not sure how many more chances you'd get to prove to the average traveler that this is in fact the \""""friendliest\"""" airport.  Give me a break.",0
"I will never fly through here again.\n\nBesides being a poorly designed airport where to make a connecting flight you have to leave the airport via zigzagging and try to catch a shuttle (20 rental shuttle buses to 1 airport shuttle) to the next terminal and face going through security all over again.\n\nSecurity only had 2 lines and if your bag needs to be checked, there is only 1 guy there to do the exam, and he does it slowly.\n\nWe barely made our flight after they called last call.\n\nWho cares about free wifi when you're desperately trying to run from one terminal to another??  There's next to no time to grab food or use the bathroom as you're struggling to throw on your shoes and stuff your liquids back in your bag in order to awkwardly run with your luggage to the plane huffing and puffing.",0
"When I used to travel a lot from Los Angeles to Ohio about 8-10 years, I often stopped at this airport because it was America West's hub and America West offered some pretty inexpensive flights.\n\nI have only connected in Phoenix.  I have never flown into or out of Phoenix.  During the day, the airport gets quite busy and that was the case on my recent visit.\n\nBecause of the good weather and the manageable planes arriving/departing, I have not experienced much delays here, which makes Phoenix a good option to connect to the East Coast.  Food (from what I saw on my short layover) is pretty standard airport food stuff.  I saw some reviews that mention free Wi-Fi, which is definitely a plus.\n\nI've been flying in and out of quite a few airport terminals recently and they are all starting to bleed together, but I think it was either this airport or SFO where the bathroom stalls have doors that go all the way to the bottom (providing a lot of privacy).  That would make George Costanza happy.\n\nIn the future, I would definitely not hesitate to connect through Phoenix to get to the East Coast.  Denver is also a good option (I would give Denver the slight edge because the terminal feels less packed and nicer than Phoenix).  O'Hare (Chicago) is probably least desirable because of the high possibility of delays.  I try to avoid Las Vegas as well because the slot machines always take at least $20 from me each time I connect through there.",1
"Okay. Disregard anything else previously said. Driving in and around this airport is a N-I-G-H-T-M-A-R-E. Strange ramps that lead you in circles, easily missed turns, etc. Trust me, I've been compared to a human version of Google Maps, and getting lost is a once in a blue moon experience for me, but this airport has continually duped me. Looking for Terminal 2? Good luck.",0
"The beach paradise of Ixtapa-Zihuatenejo awaited us....unfortunately, so did a connecting flight in ARIZONA of all places...\n\nLong story short....1/3 of our luggage did not arrive at our final destination, various articles of our clothing are still missing as well as my cell phone charger...not to mention security forcing us to open sealed containers of my son's baby food and milk for litmus tests...\n\nI looked on the bright side....at least we didn't get deported =)",0
"As far as Im concerned, the only airport better than PHX is ATL only because they have a smokers lounge for us lepers!  Clean, roomy, well-organized, with great restaurants.  Easy to get out and in with the centralized rental car pickup and drop-off building (free and frequent trips).",1
"The chick who emailed me to insult me in response to my previous review should be thrilled to know that I had to fly to PHX again yesterday and had a totally different experience - lines were short, security was cool and I was in and out in no time.  Turns out, not so bad at all.\n\nCoincidentally, I flew in on the same day you wrote me to call me a hippie!  So sorry I missed you.  Next time, I'll save up some welfare stamps and treat you to a government sponsored lunch.  It'll be great.\n\nSmooches!",1
"Efficient.\n\nAirports, in general, really suck.  They're crowded and smell like gas (or sometimes B.O.).  Everything is expensive and most people are grouchy, in a rush or both.\n\nWith that already in mind, PHX has got to be one of the best airports I've been in.  I used to be here every week, twice a week for two years when I flew for business.  Sure all of the above cons exist, but this place is easy to get around, whether you're trying to drive around it or walking through it.  Add in free wi-fi and atypically short lines at the security checkpoints, you have a heck of a great airport.  Now, if they would only make McCarran this efficient.",1
Great airport. One of my favorite airports to travel through.,1
"I'm a frequent traveler as well, and I must say - the layout and ease of Phoenix Sky Harbor is far better than most airports I've been to. At first, driving through the terminals were kind of confusing to me but then you get used to it and find out that it's just a big loop. Anyway, I've never had a problem going through security which is a big plus for me. Other airports I've been to (*cough, LAX) could give a rat's ass if people are taking too long or holding up the security line.\n\nThe food and entertainment chocies are kind of meh, but all in all - FREE WiFi! If anything, that should be enough to give this place at least 3 stars. Nothing worse than getting stuck at the airport with nothing to do! Sure, I could read a book...but that's not as fun as watching a cool movie on your laptop or phone and have people trying to peek over your shoulder...",1
It's an airport.  It sucks sometimes and it sucks less at other times.,1
"Being stuck in terminal 3 is an awful experience.  If it weren't for my notebook and the free WiFi, I'd be screwed.\n\nThere's only a Starbucks, a Wendy's, and Blue Burrito as eating options.  There's also a bar which is average at best for an airport bar.  There's a few more selections back before security, but I really don't have the desire to go through security again when I need to go back.  Especially since they had to test my TSA Approved bottle of contact lense solution.  The only other saving grace is the fact that I'm not stuck in terminal 2.\n\nWhen at Sky Harbor, try to fly an airline that goes through Terminal 4.",0
"Free Wifi deserves a full four stars.  \n\nThe layout, shops and restaurant choices are not world-class, it's mid-range level, architecture is plain, but I can't complain: free WiFI!\n\nFree WiFi alleviated the frustration when United Airlines delayed my flight back to SFO, not once, but twice.  I insist to fly United Airlines due to the Star Alliance partners:  Lufthansa and Turkish Airlines - so I suffer.\n\nThe airport staff is friendly, restaurant and establishment folks provide a hospitable service with a warm smile and genuine heart.  I'm really impressed by the Southwestern hospitality, I am so loving it.\n\nAlthough I wish I was stranded in a European or cosmopolitan airport hub, free WiFi sufficed to keep me busy and productive.\n\nIn addition to not being a world-class airport, less one star because of the crowd - male species - I hate it when I get these pickup lines and eager smiles from men (who I have nothing in common with) who even think I'd respond - yuk.  If I was in Europe, I'd smile back, or elsewhere international - oh please - leave me be to work - don't block my sun!\n\nBut free WiFi captivates this geek's heart!\n\nDid I say, free WiFi - you just made my Southwest Friday afternoon.",1
"I'm angry at this airport for only one important reason:\n\nUpon transferring from LAX to Phoenix to Raleigh-Durham, they lost my luggage. Yes, it was recovered a day later, but trust me, there's a lot of frustrating paperwork and issues associated with recovering lost luggage when you live 90+ miles from the airport...",0
Hard to give an airport a bunch of stars but sky harbor is alright in my book.  I always get through quick.  Can't wait for the renovations to finish and the new concessions policies to go in place.,1
"Wow.. talk about a mess.  I recently had the ...joy or something like that... to fly in, cart a number of friends around, and fly out of this airport.. \n\nWhen I landed the first thing I noticed was the fact that the airport looked like it hadn't been updated since about 1992.. I was waiting for someone to pull out a huge cell phone to make a call.. it was also about 85 degrees inside.. hello AC? \n\nMy next encounter with this lovely place was picking up my friends, as long as you fly United or Continental I've got no complaints, because they are located in Terminal 2 (where the hell is terminal 1?  it goes 2, 3, 4) but if you happen to fly into one of the other 2 getting to and from them is a mess.  \n\nOne day I had to drop a person off at 3, then go back to 2, and finally end at 4.  I think I looped the airport 18 times to try and find the correct route to do this.. \n\nThe only positives I've got about this place are the free Wi-Fi, a billion food options, and the ease of security.",0

"How many times have I been here? You can't even imagine. I think Sky Harbor is a great airport. The signage is easy, people are polite, and the airport is easy to figure out. I am an Arizona native and can still remember being able to go on top of the roof on what is now terminal 2 and watch planes take off and land. There is a lot of construction going on right now but the airport is still easy to navigate. You can go on top of the parking garages and watch the airplanes take off and land. The mountains surrounding the airport make for great backdrops as the planes make their ascents, and descents.",1
"Having to travel through Phoenix Sky Harbor is like having to kiss your Great-Aunt Beatrice at Thanksgiving dinner--It leaves you feeling dirty, tired, and a little confused, but you eventually just do it and dread the next time it happens.\n\nSimply flying into and out of the airport isn't as bad as connecting there. And for the initiated it's probably not too bad. But for someone who only flies here once or twice a year, it's a painful experience. It's precision maneuvering to get to the right curb, awkward layout of ticketing, and then a total disconnect in flow from the ticket counter to security.\n\nOnce at security, triple check your ticket to make sure you're at the right security gate. Whereas other airports are laid out to have only 1-3 security gates that pretty much lead to any gate, you best pay attention because each security station only serves a handful of gates. I know this isn't a hard thing to do, but it's just another nitpicky step that makes flying here a pain.\n\nConnections are the greatest downfall of this airport. If you're lucky, you may fly in to, say, gate A18 and then connect to gate A22. No big deal. A few months ago I flew into gate A30 and out of gate B20. Doesn't seem like a big deal? They're 47 miles apart. Okay, not really. But it was a loooong walk with only a couple of moving sidewalks thrown in. And don't even try to consider moving between terminal 2, 3, or 4. It would be faster to just walk to your destination city than navigate that mess.\n\nI'm not too picky about my food options, but PHX falls short here too. Yes, it's overpriced, yes it's lousy, but even here there are less options than normal.\n\nWhat I do like about Sky Harbor is the addition of free wifi. And it's pretty good wifi. Fast and easy to log in. Big plus in that category.\n\nNot sure what else they can do to make things better. Most of the problems are caused by the layout. I don't like to fly here, but sometimes you just have to suck it up and kiss Aunt Beatrice.",0
C concourse has no internet signal.  Anyone interested in a hot dog eating contest at Nathan's? No waiting.,0
"Big airport, lots of stores, eats and drinks. Airport isn't far from university town-Tempe, or Phoenix.",1
"Old, smells, and not enough signs. Not a fan.",0
Decent choice of eats and no line at security.,1
"I've already written up a review of Orbitz (CheapTickets), but my recent craptacular experience at the Phoenix Airport must also be documented...\n\nWhy on Earth would you make travelers exit the airport in order to enter a different terminal? Once you're in, you should be IN!\n\nI had the horrifying experience of rushing through the Phoenix airport last Saturday (don't ever travel around Thanksgiving, people, it's pure hell!) and to my dismay, found that I had to haul ass to a completely different terminal within the airport. Not a huge deal, right?\n\nWrong! I had to exit at baggage claim, wait around for a little shuttle bus to take me to the different terminal, get out and wait through another set of security lines. All over again. WHY?\n\nLame! Will avoid this as a connecting airport as much as possible!",0
"The airport BLOWS. Only in a state full of cheap ass old folks could you have such a POS excuse for an airport. Where to begin?\n\nA) 2 pathetic terminals that look like they were decorated in the 80's. ZERO signs that tell you where to go. The individual airlines have put in small flight monitors for their flights, but there are no monitors that show where flights connect airport wide. Wow. Thats fucking pathetic and sad.\n\nB) Transport between the terminals? Well, theres a shuttle bus, or you can walk. The walk is only about 200 yards. Except that you have to exit security, and walk OUTSIDE to get there. WTF? Really? You pathetic jackanapes couldn't pony up a few extra bucks, and build a proper sky bridge?\n\nC) Food/Drinks.....dear LORD. Heres the deal. You can forget Starbucks, or any other outside commercial food. This place is literally like an airport in a communist country. The food/drink contracts were sold off to the lowest bidder. So all the food service inside is from no-name restaurants and bars, likely all the same contractor.  And holy Jesus jello on a stick, do they suck donkey balls. Seriously. DO NOT order food in this place.\n\nCongrats Phoenix! You (joining LAX) have just made the list of 'Its better to chew your own arm off rather than fly through this wretched hole' airports.",0
"My poor review is based on the almost micro airport restaurant selection at the Continental/United terminal, the past two weeks of TSA confusion (last week took 20+ minutes for what could not have been more than 20 people), and my biggest pet peave, no fuel any where near the rental car terminal.  Ok, I am willing to accept that a gas station is a retail enterprise, but they always seem to build these rental terminals in the \""""depressed\"""" part of town, and if no fuel is near, there is never any guidance offered.  Wilco Tango Foxtrot!  Here we are rushing around the dodgy neighborhood with never a pump to be found.  Either you want the rental co to charge me $8/gallon, or the folks who conceived, designed, built, and project managed the terminal never travel.  Either way...BADTHINGS!\n\nOn the positive side, the Continental counter staff is first class, the Red Carpet club is small but nice and well staffed by professionals!",0
"although not my personal favorite i cannot think of one single complaint that could be garnered from this fine airport, they have always left me satisfied, except when i am touching down on my return flight.\nranked no. 5 in business insider magazines top ten airports in the us list, \nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/the-10-best-airports-in-america-2010-2#no-7-portland-or-international-pdx-4\n its always sunny in phoenix's own sky harbor airport is one landmark we phoenicians need to be proud of and not deride. thanks sky harbor, for all the magical flights you've sent me away to, promptly and without hassel....hoff.",1
"Phoenix (PHX) is my most dreaded lay-over airport.  It is the last airport I want to find myself when enduring a delayed flight, missed connection, or inexplicable airline misfortune.  The restaurant selections are limited.  The available stores are few and far between (especially, if you need to pick up a spare power cord or other electronic device).  Power outlets are a rarity.  Internet connection is sporadic and sparse.  There is simply no refuge when you just want to escape.  Let's hope this is the last.  Particularly since I hope to never fly US Airways again.  [Last Visit: December 17, 2010]",0
The airport is simply too big to deal with passengers effectively and efficiently. The waits for baggage are unacceptable. The parking is VERY unacceptable and now that the construction is going on to replace the shuttle buses from parking to the terminals plan on an extra half hour just to get from the airport to your car and vice versa. Also expect to pay thru the nose to park.\n\nThe only good thing about this airport is the mall level that provides a lot of stores and eateries to gobble up the long waits you'll have since you have to allow for so much time just to get here which is deep inside the metro area and prone to traffic snarls just to get to the airport.\n\nOh yeah... the free Wi-Fi? Forget about it! There are so many people on their network it crawls so slow you can't get anything done.\n\nSecurity? Better plan on a long wait there too. My worst time was 45 mins. This airport seems to be a guinea pig too many times for new TSA procedures and tests.,0
"Phoenix Sky Harbor is a bipolar little beyotch that just likes to F with you.  One day she is going to do everything in her power to try and keep you from making your flight, and the next day she is all like \""""I'm sorry about that time I made you run like an asshole through the airport to your gate.  Let me make it up to you and get you to your gate 2 hours early today\"""".  \n\nSky Harbor is #3 on my list of most hated airports, behind Newark and Philly.  Nuff said.",0
"Visiting my son in Scottsdale for the first time and I have to say the airport was clean, easy in and easy out. We flew Southwest so there was no nasty X-ray machine or anyone grabbing your goodies. :O)",1
"Not so much a fan of this airport.  Is it just me, or do you feel like you've landed in 1985 when you get off a plane here?  The furniture and d\u00e9cor need some serious updating.  And I'm not picky about my airport interior design, but it's just depressing here.  Everything seems so dim and dingy and worn-out.\n\nAnd despite free WiFi, there is a major dearth of outlets in this airport.  What outlets we could find were dead, too.  Awesome.\n\nAnd sure, the layout *makes sense,* but does everything have to be so spread out?  You'll be excited to fly into A12 and hear your connecting flight is leaving from A22 only to discover you have to walk a mile to get there.  \n\nThere are some good food options, I'll give them that.  I had an excellent burrito at 10 am Phoenix-time, because I was on Eastern-time and starving for lunch, which made people stare at me like I had three heads.  And on the way back through, a bagel breakfast sammie I enjoyed.  You know you're a Yelper when you remember airports by meal.",0
"I was reading a bunch of yelp reviews for this airport before my business trip to \""""prepare for the worst and hope for the best\"""" (after all it's always good to know what to expect) but it wasn't the case for me.  I came from the Mineta San Jose International Airport to the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (as a connecting airport) and thankfully my flying arrangements worked out.  I was coming from one US Airways flight and was on my way to another US Airways flight.  I recommend trying to have the same airlines when connecting flights.\n\nI arrived at gate A6? (I forgot the gate but close enough) and had to catch my other flight at gate A27.  They were on opposite ends of Terminal 4 (where US Airways is) so I had to walk all the way there which took awhile.  It's not bad if you're not in a rush but I was almost in a rush.  I had enough time to buy something at Burger King (I wanted something for dinner before going on a long flight), eat/drink super quick, and board my next flight.  If that was already a \""""close call\"""", then I don't want to know what happens if I didn't have the same airlines.  I wouldn't be surprised if it would be similar to other Yelpers' reviews about this place and not a good one.\n\nThat's pretty much it.  Make sure you have the same airlines for connecting flights; otherwise, you might miss your flight.\n\nOh and they sold hair gel at one of the stores; however, the hold of the gel was weak for my needs. Lol it was still better than no hair gel.",1
"Phoenix airport (Sky Harbor) is one of the better airports to fly through.  Mainly because there's quite a few selections for bars / restaurants, as well as the weather there (hot / dry) means less chance of weather related lay overs.  = awesome.  Plus the \""""people-movers\"""" are fantastic.",1
"Always a quick in / quick out airport. Never had to wait longer than 10 minutes for a security line, most of the time it is less than 5 minute wait. Lots of places to shop and eat, and there are multiple Starbucks.\n\nFree wifi but... I always have a difficult time with the connection. Perhaps to many people are \""""in the cloud.\""""",1
There was a wendys. Thats it in my terminal worth mentioning.  Bathroom doors don't lock.,0
"The following is a few reasons why I dig Sky Harbor Airport. \n\n-Security moves pretty quickly.\n-There are quite a few restaurant options. \n-Everything is carpeted and very clean. \n- They have free transportation that will take you from one terminal to another. \n-Clean restrooms\n-Free Wifi \n- It might just be a Phoenix thing, but even the TSA agents were hot.\n\nI'm sure there are some cons as well, but all in all my experiences have always been pleasant flying in or out of here.",1
"You want good food? You'd be better off smuggling goat cheese in your boot and risking an anal cavity search for doing so than eating at this airport.\n\nYou want scenery? Try desert.\n\n\nYou want a comfortable seat to wait for your delayed flight?  Well you are in the desert so you'd probably better off finding a cactus and straddling it face first.\n\nYou want a relatively close connection for your flight? Well tough shit.  Oh yeah, they've got people movers but somehow they have this magical ability to disengage people's legs.  Yeah I know it sounds crazy but as soon as people step on to these things their legs stop moving and they plant their fat ass right in the middle of the walk way.  Whats wrong with your legs you mammoth!?",0
"Sky Harbor Airport is one of the most modern looking airports.  On top of it, it has to be one of the easiest airports to get around.  You can either enter the airport off the 143 highway or you can go straight on 44th St going south.  Sky Harbor gives plenty of chances and warnings of which terminals to go to.  There is basically 2 different departure terminals and two different arrival terminals.  The arrival portion can be a bit confusing, so you need to coordinate with your ride to the airport.  Once you get out of the gate, you have an option of going to the South Side or North Side.\n\nI have to say that this airport never seems to get too busy.  I have come here during major holidays, and the traffic is never bad.  I am not sure if it is because of the structure or if there are not as many passengers going in and out of Phoenix.  \n\nI never really get airport food, but this airport has all sorts of varieties.  They have a few good bars near the terminals to relax and chill before a flight.",1
"Hate getting stuck here when I need to eat. There aren't very many choices and after you go through security the choices get even slimmer.  Bluck.  \n\nHowever, getting through security generally is better other airports, but that's primarily due to their size.  \n\nOff site car rental is a drag and adds a lot of extra time.  Always seem to be just missing a bus when I return the car and have to wait.",0
"Not the worst airport and not the best.  I flew in on US Airways which they tend to cater to so it is also their largest terminal.  As luck would have it, I had a connecting flight that landed at the end of terminal B and my connecting flight was at the very end of terminal A.  To top it off, most of the people mover sidewalks were down.  Thankfully, I didn't mind the exercise and I had an hour in between connections.  Had my plane been late or the connection shorter, I would have been pissed at all of the maintenance.  The airport can use some updates and isn't the cleanest but, they at least have plenty of eatery choices.",0
I just love going to the airport and sitting at the bar to people watch. It is a great place to meet new people. although I got bumped off of my flight it was a good time.,1
"PHX bills it self as \""""America's friendiest airport\"""".  SO NOT TRUE.  America's friendliest airport took 3 of 4 moving sidewalks out of service instead of one at a time.  This is area is half of the concourse connector bewtween low A and low B (N2 and N3) in Terminal 4 north.\n\nSignage: poor to non existent.  If it's there, it's not placed well.\nYears and years of poor planning.\n\nPHX Sky Harbor management would do well to tour other airports to see what ideas they might be able to borrow.  For instance, ditch all the carpet and go with tile.",0
"The surliness and thievery committed by the Phoenix based TSA employees really ruin PHX Sky Harbor from being a traveler Friendly Airport. This is also the same airport that kills drunk housewives! I use this airport weekly and have had numerous gear stolen by TSA employees at checkpoint C... Stolen items include portable hard drives, laptop batteries, USB drives and an LCD Projector.",0
"Only was here for a couple of hours on a stopover...\n\nLots of people on a Thursday morning.\nPlace looked new and clean with lots of eateries and shops available.\nLooked way better, cleaner and newer than our San Diego location.",1
Leave lots of time if you are using a rental car!  The rental car center is quite far from the airport and you have to wait for the shuttle.  No tram or alternate routes means at least 20 minute process.,0
I have never been to a more ridiculous airport. DFW seems sane when compared to this place. Don't ever get a connection flight here that switches airlines because I did and found out that all the terminals are separated and can only be reached by leaving the security zone and riding a bus. Now most modern airports would respond to this with a train or moving walkway between terminals so that passengers don't have to leave the secure zone but not here. \n\n I will avoid flying here in the future. The one saving grace this place has is that the view of the mountains around is breath taking and even more amazing from the air.,0
"If I ever wanted to feel like I was in a movie I'd rob a bank for the thrill or date a 15 year-old. \n\nEvery time I've made a connection here I've sprinted, shoved my way and slid feet first to the next gate (TERMINAL). Whether I'm on time, late or early. Rieffendiculous! Who the hell is in charge of coordinating the connections?\n\nI suspect someone is on Colored Time and it pisses me off. \n\nAlso, I 'd like to speak to the architect who designed this airport 'cause this cumulative time consumption is busting my balls. Thanks Shek S.",0
"You are so clean, Sky Harbor. \nI don't mind flying out of this airport. The flight attendants are nice.\n\nSecurity is fast and thorough. I really dislike one lady that works in security, because she was rude to me for no reason. It probably wouldn't have bugged me so much if it weren't for the fact that it was 11:45 PM, I had just worked a double, and I was being forced to fly to Ohio....where it was cold and still had snow on the ground.. Oh not to mention on my Spring Break. \n\nAnyway, the stores are nice and have a good amount of nice items to buy for your flight to keep you occupied. \n\nFlights are on time the majority of the time, and when they aren't they at least warn you.. *cough cough* Cleveland Hopkins International *cough cough*.\n\nI suppose it could use some remodeling.",1
"Having to leave security and board a bus to get from one terminal to another = complete design failure.\n\nHaving all the food outside of said security = extremely inconvenient.\n\nAfter having to play roulette with the length of the security line while wolfing down food on a short layover, there is no way to win.  Sky Harbor, you lose. Go to the back of the line. Do not pass go. Do not collect $200. No cookie for you. One star for you.\n\nThe (considerable) amount of ill will I can summon for Sky Harbor feels completely inadequate (over a year later).",0
"Yes, I'm spoiled.  I grew up in Denver and enjoyed DIA--the most pristine airport you will ever visit--for the majority of my life.  In comparison, Sky Harbor is just another run-of-the-mill airport.  \n\nThe food sucks.  One time before a flight I had a teriyaki chicken bowl at one of the generic restaurants (I decided this would be one of the most healthy options aside from Quiznos--too many delicious dipping sauces...).  I must not have been thinking about the effects of eating a dish with an astronomical amount of sodium, because my feet swelled so much that I had to remove my shoes during the flight.  Lovely.  \n\nParking is a nightmare.  There is no logic the parking garage.  It corkscrews you up and you're suddenly on level 6, without a hint as to the location of the terminal's entrance.  When I flew back home from my trip, I went out to the parking garage to find my car, only to realize that I was in the wrong terminal.  If you're flying on different airlines in and out of Sky Harbor, make note of the terminal where your car is parked!  \n\nOne must take a shuttle between terminals to get between them.  Never fun after a day of traveling.\n\nI thought it would be relatively painless to simply pick someone up or drop them off here.  What a nightmare.  Especially when you have to reach terminal 2.  \n\nBeware: terminal 2 has no clearly marked signs for passenger drop off.  I had to circle around and almost ended up back on the 202, all while dodging the rude taxi and shuttle drivers that LOVE to cut me off.  Disastrous when your precious cargo is about to miss their flight.    \n\nThe signs to get back on the 202 aren't very clear either.  I need arrows.  I need signs that say \""""left lane 202 E\""""  or \""""right lane 202 W\"""" (disclaimer:  I have no clue if the right or left lane take you east or west).  How in the world they twist you around each side of every terminal and loop you through to the highway, I have no clue.  \n\nObviously, I don't enjoy coming here.  But the hope of enjoying my destination city keeps me coming back.  Plus, I have no other choice.  Unless I buy my own jet.  Even then I will probably still have to deal with the crazy taxi drivers.",0
"ATMOSPHERE: Clean facilities but nothing spectacular. \nAIRPORT: To get around the airport you have all these silver buses that take you from terminal to terminal which there are 4 terminals and also you have moving walk ways.

"Upon further review, I have to update my review of Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport....I must have been lucky the first few times I went through here....either that or this place went downhill fast.  Here's some of my frustrations with this place:\n\n- The FREE WiFi sucks.....the past 4 times I've been through this airport, I have been unsuccessful in connecting to their WiFi.  I can get the connection on my laptop, but it won't load up any pages.....don't know what the problem is, when I land in Vegas or San Diego, it works just fine there.\n\n\n- Car Rental return lanes through the airport is confusing.  I am willing to bet that 9 out of 10 people who try to find the car rental return lane have to attempt it at least 2 or 3 times to figure it out.....the directions and route is crazy confusing.  The rental center itself is convenient, and the process of returning your car is efficient, but driving there is a disaster.\n\n- Food options are limited once you go past security.  Not much going on there.\n\n- Gates have insufficient seating.  I don't get it....there's not enough seats at most of the gates.....it's very crowded and people are cramped all over the place.\n\nHopefully, they can upgrade it soon....it needs it.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%, but not by choice.",0
Not very busy and easy to get through security.,1
"Phoenix, phoenix, phoenix. \n\nYou sure worked hard to make me dislike you.\n\nLet me pre-face this by saying I am a frequent traveler. I've flown through many airports from the East Coast to the W Coast to international destinations. I am no stranger to TSA (and their ever-changing rules) and to all the insanity that accompanies traveling (old people, kids, etc). \n\nLanding in Phoenix wasn't so bad and I was happy to see that they offered free wifi. \n\nBut flying OUT of Phoenix. Oh boy.\n\nI'm glad I gave myself buffer time as you will definitely need it in this airport. Why, you ask?\n\nOLD People. \n\nNow before I'm called an age-ist; let's just be honest. Elderly people move slower, get confused easier and tend to not give a f*ck.\n\nCombine all those things with TSA people and what do you get?\n\nEvery person in Phoenix apparently didn't know that there was a liquid rule. So people were rolling into check-point with bottles of water in their bags. And TSA, of course, was not being nice about it. \n\nTSA in Phoenix also decided I was apparently a terrorist as they swabbed me for explosive material. In all my trips to different destinations, I've never had that happen. \n\nAZ was pretty - the sunshine was beautiful. BUT .. You better comply with the 2+ hour rule because you'll definitely need it. There's nothing worse than having the elderly person ask \""""Do I need to take my belt off? Or shoes?\""""\n\n\""""No sir. Please leave them on. I don't mind missing my flight or having to watch you go through the x-ray machine 3 times.\""""",0
"I have traveled through so many airports over the years, Denver, Chicago, Omaha, New York, Ontario, Amsterdam, Denpasar, Tokyo, Taipei, London, Munich, Kingston, Bangkok and the list goes on. Phoenix Sky Harbor ranks as the WORST airport of all time. Upon my flight arrival, exiting the tarmac ramp at the Frontier Airlines gate, I saw no electronic billboards, no tv screens and no information for connecting flights. No airport assistants or volunteers either! A TSA employee directed me to another security screening area. It turned out he gave me  the wrong directions. By the time I reached that wrong TSA check point a second TSA agent directed me to a MAZE of directions. Sheinformed me that I needed to go past the baggage pickup, out the door and far away. By that time, I had just minutes to make it to my flight back to Hawaii (home). I finally found an \""""assistance\"""" desk on my way past the luggage pickup. He told me to exit the building, go outside, walk 30 feet and wait for a bus that would take me to my gate(US Airways Terminal).  He also tells me I am going to miss my flight. As I'm running like crazy, I see another man getting directions from a TSA agent! Meanwhile, I'm standing OUTSIDE thinking \""""what the heck!\"""" Finally the bus came and it dropped me off at the US Air terminal. Then I ran up an escalator, across a path and finally to TSA security where I had to go through security once again. As if they couldn't see I was out of breath. I know they looked at my ticket and saw my flight time! The TSA agent held up my screening because I took my laptop out of it's case and laid it \""""on top\"""" of the thin, neoprene case. \""""I have to run this through again. You need to put the case in another bin and just leave the laptop in the bin all by itself.\"""" Wow! I haven't heard that one in ALL my travels!  I gave a grateful smile with an apology then ran like heck about 250+ feet to my gate. They were just closing the door!!!!!!  \nSky Harbor needs a closed airport layout. You should never have to leave and go outside to a connecting flight!  Thats just dangerous security-wise. Until Sky Harbor has a seamless airport (i.e. Denver)  they need workers out in the terminal gates assisting travelers. They need TV \nmonitors! Lots of them! Never again Sky Harbor! Never!",0
"Definitely not my favorite airport....\n\n*Horrible food options, no good bars.\n*Inefficient, long security lines nearly all the time\n*UGLY\n*no free wifi (Vegas has spoiled me!)\n*rental car place is FAR and takes awhile. You have to add an hour to your travel on either side to deal with the rental car pickup/return.\n\nI wish I could think of something remotely positive about this airport, but I can't !",0
I hate this place,0
"Sky Harbor International Airport is the best international airport in Arizona. Ha, kidding. Seriously though I've been to a lot of airports and Sky Harbor is clean, the staff is friendly, and it's easy to navigate. They have pretty good eateries as well. They are doing a major construction project on the airport to add a high speed tram that will allow travelers to more easily get from terminal to terminal, as well as their cars if parked in long term parking. Once finished it should be even easier to get to where you need to be. Without much in the way of choices for airports it's good to have one that is so centrally located, easy to navigate, is comfortable, and has friendly people working there.",1
Another reason that I love the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport is because I can always get through the security in record speed. I have never waited longer than 10 minutes and that is pretty amazing.,1
Sky Harbor Airport has the coolest dog walking area I have ever seen! It has a small doggie drinking fountain... its shaded... and it even has a FIRE HYDRANT! \n\nI think I will take it upon myself to visit every airport in the country and review the pet sanitary situation! :)\n\nI am sure there is a website idea in there somewhere.,1
"Get your walking shoes on this airport is pretty spread out without the aid of people movers. Also compared to newer updated airports, there are no power ports and the WiFi never connected on my laptop but worked on my iPhone.\nThe airport needs some good upgrading in the near future.\nBonus for not loosing my luggage and pick up and drop off locations are convenient and there are a ton of stores and eating places where you could easily have a 24 hr layover and never run out of food options.\nI noticed they had little museums scattered about the airport and it would have been fun to look at all of them if I had time.\nSecurity was quick and prompt and this is the first time I had the full body scan... I made sure to suck in my gut and flex.",0
"Terminal 2 is possibly the slowest security  I have ever been through, anywhere. Allow plenty of time especially in the morning.",0
"We flew with Southwest, which was running 2 hours late due to weather on the east coast, hardly Sky Harbor's fault.  So, we didn't get there until 8:30PM on a Sunday.  All I needed to make me happy was a frozen yogurt and an open book store.  I had finished Game of Thrones the night before, and was hoping to find the sequel, or even just a magazaine to keep me occupied.  I struck out in both regards.  And then, they managed to lose our luggage.  So, in all, Sky Harbor, you disappoint me!",0
"I despise this airport.\n\nI've breezed through check-in and security before, but enough times it's been the utter nightmare from hell so it forces you to arrive 2 hours early for a flight.\n\nRenting a car here is ridiculous.  It's the absolute longest ride on a shuttle to the \""""rental car center\"""" that I've ever seen.  I'm not joking.  Add another 15-20 minutes to that 2 hour lead time, folks.  And there are no gas stations around it, probably because if there were it would get robbed daily.\n\nThe fallout shelter design--the place is a concrete bunker, after all--while hardening the facility in the case of a direct nuclear strike, also prevents cell phone reception.  Don't count on being able to call people and say \""""i'm here, come get me.\"""" when you are in baggage claim.\n\nPhoenix has special place in US aviation.  Yes, it may be one of the only major hub airports that will shut down because it's too damn hot to fly.  Be warned.\n\nOn the plus side, the concessions are fairly decent (if somewhat forgettable), and it's pretty easy to get a non-stop flight to/from here from most places in the country.  Free wi-fi, but that's starting to become the norm rather than the exception.\n\nMeh.",0
"Really, the only redeeming quality of this garbage airport is the free wi-fi. It gets two stars for that, and that's it.\n\nThe place is huge and it doesn't have any sort of rapid transit to navigate the place. There are just tons of long hallways and those stupid flat escalator things (their name is escaping me, and I'm really tired/pissed at airports right now). We arrived at 9pm and every damn restaurant in the place was closed, so I had to settle for a crappy bag of peanuts for dinner. BLASPHEMY!\n\nThe entire time I was here (2 hours, maybe), I felt like I was in the coldest, most boring, deserted hallway where you could hear a pin drop from miles away; and the airport literally feels like it is miles long.",0
"\""""It's grey with green and white plaid,\"""" I tell the lady at the customer service desk. \""""The brand is Burton.\""""\n\nMy bag. It was up in the air somewhere after they checked it in at the gate, said there weren't any more spaces in the overhead bin. Of course, when I get to my seat, there's a vacuum of space, and the flight attendant didn't check to see when my flight was landing in Cabo. I had a four hour lay-over.\n\nThis gave me plenty of time to wander around Phoenix Sky Harbor. This airport is massive. Shaped like a giant rectangle with four gates connected by long corridors and automatic walkways, it's kind of amazing how much space there is. But take a peek outside the expanse of windows, through the sweltering 110+ degree midday glare you can see why--there's simply not a lot of stuff in Phoenix but desert, a few buildings, and a range of mountains.\n\nThe food here isn't much to write home about, a lot of repeat offenders like Starbucks, Burger King, Cinnabon, and a few local eateries. There's also a few really sad California Pizza Kitchen ASAP kiosks here that are so small they don't even serve pizza, they've got just enough room for a fridge packed with salad. Strange.\n\nSo I'm wandering around the baggage claim area, hoping they didn't lose my luggage. I look at my ticket my baggage re-routing order, \""""Grey with green and white plat.\"""" WTF. And later I find out that my bag was put on the next flight to Cabo, and got there three hours before I did. If there's anything like purgatory here on earth, this is it.",0
"Worst International Airport in the United States. And I've been traveling for three decades.\n\nWhat makes it horrible is anytime you have a connecting flight you must do two horrible, extremely inefficient things:\n\n1.) Walk half a mile (I'm not exaggerating) to get to the domestic main terminals - with very limited moving platforms. It's so complicated and looong that they have people in purple to guide you as you carry your luggage for 20 minutes while your back and hands are in pain. Other airports have trams and buses near the customs/terminal areas to make it simple and fast. \n\n2.) You have to go through the whole security checkpoint again, despite doing it at your previous destination / layovers. What airport does this? Ridiculous. \n\nThe only good side is the people are friendly (but part of that is because they have a ton of staff to guide you through your 1 hour journey from terminal to your next airline). \n\nIf you must, remember to bring a redbull and do some stretches. It'll be a looooong way for your connecting flight if you travel international to domestic. \n\nWorst airport in America for efficiency.",0
"Insanity!  Overcrowding!  Being on one side of the Southwest terminal and then to run your ass to the otherside to make your connecting flight in what seems like a mile away at the otherside of the terminal.  (It is set up like a giant U.  So it is quite the jog).\n\nThe food places in here stink, the bathrooms are cramped and there are not enough seats for everyone waiting for their flight.  \n\nIn short, this airport stinks.  The only saving grace is the quality customer service from the employees.",0
Hmmm...Phoenix Airport.\n\nLet's see what we have. The one thing a hub should not do is make it difficult to get from Flight A to Flight B. A mandatory walk across the airport is not good. I bought spinners so I could get around airports on transfers. That carpet will not let you roll yours easily. The bathrooms are minimal in size. Screens you have to squint at to view arrivals and departures are another underwhelming feature there.\n\n Oh well. Getting liquored up here at the many bars/restaurants is Ground Harbor's one redeeming feature. They do have some decent southwestern faire though.,0
"Is messy and gates are everywhere! If your gate changes they don't tell you unless you ask, that would have been nice to know considering the fact that i almost missed my flight cause I was NEVER told my gate changed, not only did it change but it was clear on the other side of the freakin airport!!! The food lines are rediculous and the food is WWAAYY over priced!! The cashiers at the shops are more interested in \""""airport\"""" drama than letting me buy my diet coke and peanuts",0
"Not much to say about C 3 gate except yuk and gross.  Old looking and outdated carpeting and seating.  You better have some good shoes and good wheels on your suitcase.  The carpet was ripped up in places and it doesn't allow for efforlless pushing.  You must pull your bag if you need to get around quickly. \n\nReally?  You put a food vendor right next to the men's bathroom??  It's already tight enought trying to get in/out of the bathroom as it is with those small doorways.  You have to wait and let the other person pass or your either bang into each other or your luggage will get all caught up.  Stop building trams and restaurants and build better/bigger bathrooms.  \n\nNow for the coup de grace:   DISGUSTING - especially since I saw a number of men who came out of the stall and didn't wash their hands.  When I came out of the bathroom, two of them were standing in line to get food at California Pizza Kitchen.  Really?? all I could think about was their germ/bacteria laden hands toucing napkins/utensils. Even the money that might have been used to give me change.   CPK?  you need the location/money that bad? \n\nThe seating areas (at least for this terminal) are few and cramped.  I've never seen such self righteous fliers who think their bag deserves a seat  when other people are standing or looking for seating.  Ugh.... SKY HARBOR - Epic #Fail!",0
"There is nothing simple about this airport. Security sucks. if you are connecting from one airline to another, you have to go through securtiy again. and they don't care how short a window is for  your connection. \nIf you have to go to another terminal to connect, there are no signs to tell you which airlines are in which terminal. Employees are not helpful. \n\nI hate this airport. I would rather have a root canal than to fly into/connect through sky harbor.",0
"This is just an okay airport - the layout is not great, although I do have to give props to them for easy car rental terminals.",0
Fuck this airport. TPA represent!,0
"We have concluded that anyone that has anything nice to say (Other than it's clean) about the employees/TSA/ or Airline employees (Especially U.S. Airways) has been paid by a social media company or employer  to Yelp good things. One in particularly, sounded as if it were written straight from HR...Good organization... LOL.  Anyway, believe all of the horror stories that you hear about airports and TSA. They are more than likely all true.  I'm looking for other options now but if it comes down to just staying put I'd rather do that, personally.  I'll never fly U.S. Airways again. They didn't even give my husband and I seats together. After more research I discovered that this is a trick that they do to pump more money out of couples.  \n\nThe days of \""""Thank you for flying with us\"""" or \""""Happy travels\"""" is a thing of the past. We all know why but the scary thing is that there are not any checks and balances In place for the TSA.  They have no fear of being as horrid as they wish. If you give them any offence they threaten with the police who are all but ready to go nuts on anybody. \n\nHowever, they were not as bad as the TSA and actually helped us a little.  Since there's a monopoly now with airlines they do not have any need to be pleasant and believe me U.S. Airways is the worst from the obnoxious and loud flight attendant, to the old nasty planes, to the pilot that says on loud speaker, \""""Keep it moving one bag on top and one on the bottom you are delaying the plane.\""""\n\n We had all just gotten on to board and it's as if the pilot was already blaming us for his enviable lateness.  \nNothing can compare to what TSA did and it's unbelievable. I actually spilled an ICEE  because some woman that jumped out at me and said we're doing extra screening today mam\""""... You know you'll have to throw that away before you get up there.\"""" She scanned me on my hand and right before I went up to the line I threw it away and missed.  \n\nI apologized to the lady sitting in front that saw me... Suddenly this mean old lady comes out and the girl just says there was a spill. This woman said, \""""Who did it\"""" so harshly that the girl wouldn't rat on me. I honestly think that if she had I would have gone to jail right then and there.  The woman says who did it!!! Like the Soup Nazi and I just said, I don't know but she had on a brown shirt and blue jeans you cannot let her get away with this. LOL.  I swear this TSA woman had a gun on her hip and said, that she couldn't handle it and left.  \n\n\nNeedless to say it was tough right at the get go but it just got worse and worse and yes I had to endure the famous pat down too. The second Soup Nazi was giving me orders and I honestly thought that she wanted me to lift my shirt so I did.  You should have watched this bitch put on a show like I had offended her deepest core of her soul.  I feared that she wouldn't recover from the shock and I'm telling you I'm cute. LOL.  I'm not that hard on the eyes.  She recovered enough to do the pat down as if that $60 million dollar x-ray, (that most likely killed my white blood cells) couldn't get everything on my person. \n\n\nThe story is longer and crazier and it ended up that we got on the plane and then we were called off of the plane and we just left. The only good thing that I can say is that U.S. Airways did refund our money and so did Expedia.  However, we missed our trip and lost $500.00  for a psychodrama workshop. Oh, one of the TSA agents asked me where I was going. I thought that saying Berkeley, CA would be  a good thing because it's one State over.... How likely am I to highjack a plane that's going two hours away? He grunted back to me...\""""Berkeley why do you want to go to Berkeley\"""" as though I had said Death Valley.  Once I answered the psychodrama workshop he had no response because he had no clue what it was. LOL. \n\n \nI have spoken with a friends of my mother's who was a child in France right before the Nazi's invaded. She said that America has that same eerie feeling right now that she cannot shake. I didn't really get it until Thursday but I agree now. I don't think that it's a color thing... I think that it's a new American Terrorist group called the TSA from Homeland Security and it's them or us.  We are seen as pesky insects that are trying to get them and they have to get us first. It's as if no one said to them look, most of these people are just business or vacation travelers so be pleasant and do your job.  \n\nThey definitely need checks and balances and someone there to handle their misconduct. They are completely out of control.  What happened in Afghanistan has nothing to do with this ongoing horror that has been unleashed on the American public. Perhaps, we are just getting ready for what is to become once the Chinese takes over. LOL. \n\nOh, and just because U.S. Airways claims that they allow carry-on pets every employee there treated us as if we had a patient with Leprosy with us from the ticket booth through TSA.",0
"This airport is old.  It feel weary, and wrinkly and sun beaten, much like those old women who look like gila monsters who stayed out in the sun too long during their youth.  The airport layout is confusing with the terminals all in a straight line and piers off those terminals at odd places.  \n\nIn order to get from terminal to terminal, you need to walk.  They do have moving walkways, but people refuse to walk on them.  I hate these people.  Or worse, they don't walk, preferring to amble or perambulate their slow ass down the rubber highway.  I have a limited connection time usually and I don't want to get stuck here, so please move faster.  \n\nI fly US Airways, and this is their sorriest hub.  Inherited from the merge with America West, it doesn't even feel like a hub.  There are no flat screen monitors for flights waiting you when you deplane.  Instead there are a few monochromatic CRT displays that look like they went with my 386 computer back in the day, running DOS.  SimCity what???\n\nSo I don't like it here.  I'm not sure what they can do to make me like it, but a better way to connect terminals would be a start.",0
"I would like you to know this was a HORRIBLE experience & me and my family will NOT be returning.So we were in a lay over coming from Cancun then to SFO everything was fine until after we picked up our luggage to recheck it in.We noticed the two families from our flight going into the same area but before that we have to show our card with our family members name on it well the two families before us were able to go ahead but this man told us we have to go to the side to have a man re look through all our bags which made NO sense because we literally just picked them up and the families ahead of us were able to go so I brushed it off as if whatever but in the back of my head wondered why this man let those families go through with no problem?So we got to the last station were we believe the workers name was Perea?but we heard another man call him Alvin by the first name,talk about RUDE! He asked if we had food I said one piece of a hamburger left maybe like 2 inches and he yells \""""IS IT PORK?!\""""and I proceeded to say ,\""""no I believe it is meat,you can take it if you'd like\"""" and he yells back at me, \""""UH NO THIS IS NOT TRASH CAN\"""" & let me inform you this is in front of my family my mother,little sister,& grandmother so we just look at each other like OK?so he informs us to put our suitcases on the machine to have them go trough so we start out with my 70 year old grandmother who's bag weighs about 26 pounds this man yells at her!Saying\""""DON'T THROW IT ON THERE\""""now tell me how is my 70 year old grandmother going to throw a 26 pound bag?!so we proceeded to put ours and once again yells at us to not throw it,I'm not sure if this man needs a nap or a raise but he was scum and deff needs to be talked to. So that experience sucked so finally got our baggage re checked for our next flight now to head to the security/TSA department now let me say something really quick I am NOT racist I am Hispanic & most of my friends are Caucasian but how I was treated in the TSA department was HORRID! We got our Passports checked and were told to go through the security as is everyone else, well we were on one side,there was a group of Indian decent men in front of us,a Caucasian family behind us & in the booth next to us only Caucasian people.So we put our stuff through the machine next to a TSA machine & also a metal detector.I'd like to know  how come the Caucasian woman working sent the Caucasian group of people next to us all through the regular metal detector but had my whole family and the Indian men in front of us go through the TSA machine but as soon as I'm waiting for my turn in the TSA this woman let the cacusian people behind me just go through the metal detector!!!!!! I'd like to say that's some bullshit especially because all I was wearing was a tank top shorts and flip flops NO JEWELRY! What could it had hurt if I went through the regular detector!!!!This makes no sense to me and as soon as I walk out the TSA machine ANOTHER woman working there stops me and rechecks me with a hand metal detector!!!! are you shitting me?! My family just standing there looking at me like are you serious?! So this makes no sense to me and is just pushing me to make even a bigger uproar.So when she was done I proceeded to get my belongings and walk out but the flapping door wouldn't push open so I had to pull it towards me to get out and the woman YELLS,\""""NO it's the other way PUSH IT!\""""seriously if it worked the other way I would have I'm not an idiot it says PUSH but it wasn't exactly even on the sides so it wouldn't. Finally we had gotten out that area and proceeded to our Terminal where all the seats were taken up and 6 were taken up by a Caucasian man who felt the need to sleep across all the chairs we tried to wake him to move but nope nothing so we proceeded to tell the  woman working can you please have him move but did she do anything??oh OF COURSE NOT so we were left to sit on the ground!! Thank you! I have to say we were so disappointing we heard Arizona was disliked for some of their racial issues and also are being attacked by LULZSEC and the hacking of Arizona police but DAMN REALLY?No wonder it's so hott it is HELL.\np.s. They say they have free WIFI but it didn't work on my Iphone or Laptop.\n\n\n\nand for a update they called me to apologize & said it had nothing to do with my race,that maybe I WAS HAVING AN OFF DAY?!wow....I appreciate them actually calling back but the least they could of offered me a Starbucks gift card comeeeeeeeeeeeeee on.",0
"My recommendation: Stay close to your gate because their loudspeakers aren't very...loud\n\nThey have Free WiFi!\n\nI've been to a lot of airports and PHX is definitely not one of my favorite.  Food, drink, and amenities at this airport are seriously lacking.  These are all important factors to consider when you have a delay or layover and want something decent to eat.

"99% of people traveling the SAN-SJC/SFO route go directly or through LAX. I decided to be a bit adventurous and span my reach out into the desert to explore PHX, to which I have never been before. Sure it cost me 3 extra hours, but it also solidified the notion in my mind that PHX is a piece of shit. During my 2 hour layover, this is what I discovered:\n\n- For some reason, one satellite of Terminal A is close to empty, while the other side is barely navigable. \n\n- There is absolutely no good food options. All you have to choose from is your typical Burger King-style fast food and other chains that seem like a normal option but turn out to be just as bad and tasteless.\n\n- Everything is just so plain and boring. The walls are a nasty sandy color. The people walking through all have this monotone \""""don't bother me\"""" look on their face, or maybe that's just what flying does to people these days. The carpets have no life in them, and neither do the employees. It's basically one big shithole.\n\n- Toilets are complete crap.

"I've flown out of this airport for quite a while now, since I have lived in Phoenix for several years, and I have to say, its quite a nice airport.  Sky Harbor has three Terminals, (terminal 2, 3 and 4) but it seems that most people fly out of Terminal 3 and 4...well, at least I have.  Plus, since I've had several family members and friends come in and out, I've had really positive experiences picking them up as well.\n\nMy most recent visit was to Terminal 3, and it was really fun and easy getting in and out of here. I was dropped off by a friend, went inside and checked my luggage.  Security was easy, and off to my flight I went.  Plenty of places to eat and hang out in here, plus you get free wifi at the airport!  I hate running down my battery, so I try to plug it in when and where I can.  More challanging to find a plug if the airports busy, but its big enough to find one if you really scour.\n\nI also like that theres plenty of places to eat in AND out of the security area.  Makes waiting for a flight much easier, because if I want a cup of coffee, bagel, or something more substantial, I don't have to go through security to get it.  I've taken a few friends to the airport, parked the car, and gone in and had a quick bite to eat with them before their flight takes off.  I've also helped my mom navigate this place as well for when she gets into town so she knows where shes going.  My dad? not so much.  He prefers to navigate his own way.  LOL.\n\nThere's also rental car counters in here as well, who will help you get into a vehicle when you arrive.  love it!\n\nBaggage claim here is quick.  I mean, its FAST.  Be prepared to get off your flight and go directly to get your bags, otherwise your gonna be late getting them!  Also, there's plenty of ground transportation here, so you can grab a taxi, super shuttle or what not to get a ride home in case you do not have one.  \n\nEven though I have never used it, there's also plenty of on and off site parking here as well.  Off site is obviously cheaper, and most of the spots have coupons along with regular shuttles to and from the lots to the terminals.  I also like how the light rail connects to Sky Harbor as well.\n\nLove you sky harbor, keep up the good work!",1

"VERY SLOW SECURITY CHECKPOINT\n\nThis airport has the worst baggage security checkpoint. Lines are inefficiently placed. X-ray watchers are overly cautious.

I did not take my computer off my bag since it does not have a magnetic drive. Computers without magnetic drive are supposed to be fine within bag since they don't affect X-Rays. However, security watcher was overly cautious so he called the police for \""""bag check\"""". Police guys didn't show up for 10 minutes. Then they finally show up and say I simply needed to take the computer out and run it again The security watcher person could tell me to take the computer out which he didn't have to and I wouldn't miss my flight, neither would other people need to wait.

"Terminal 2 is very basic and public wifi is a nofi. But I suppose it's not a major united hub, so I wouldn't expect their terminal to be top notch.

Not only is it way away from the terminals, it takes forever to get to when dropping the car off!",0
i don't know what this airport has such a low rating...  i've been to a variety of airports around the country and this has to be one of the cleanest and most organized ones!  the only downfall i see is they need a few more signs to direct people to the correct shuttle areas...  we had a hard time finding the rental car shuttle.,1

"Reading some of the reviews for this airport, mine is definitely different because I never have a good experience here, especially this past weekend. What erked me the most was that the bathrooms were dirty, felt like it hasn't been cleaned for days. And it wasn't just me, other travelers passed by the stalls and just left the bathroom, even trying to go to the other restrooms, it was the same thing. And I'm not sure what side of the airport it is, but there are no outlets to charge your phone or other electronic devices, which really was annoying. If you're laying over in Phoenix, just beware that you might have to hike to your other gate and when you walk through the other terminals, be sure to watch out for the carts that give rides to people, they might just run you over.\nThe rental car place is a separate building and it was nice because it was all in one facility, but the buses to transport travelers gets full pretty fast, especially if there are families, so just make sure to lineup.",0
You know - I made my plane but the services here are lame.  The obligatory magazines & snacks shop is here.  A crappy eatery here and there.  A fancy gift shop where you can buy a $400 Navajo made Bolo Tie.  Fortunately there's WiFi so you can spend your time at the terminal surfing the Internets.,0
"I've never really had an opinion about an airport, but Sky Harbor changed that.  I arrived at terminal 2, which had no signage about which airlines are in which terminals, like every other airport I've been in.  Having only 30 minutes to catch a connecting flight, I burned 5 minutes trying to figure out where to go!\n\nA TSA agent told me I needed to leave  the terminal, exit security, get on a shuttle to transfer to terminal 3. After getting to terminal 3, again no signage directing to gates.  I also had no boarding pass, so I'd have to find a check in window.  Another TSA agent directed me where to go.  Here's where it gets really fun.  After getting off the shuttle, you go in the door, go up the escalators to the second level, then go around the corner to find the elevators to go down one level to the ticket counters.  Yeah, I couldn't believe it either.\n\nNeedless to say with all that, I missed my flight.  \n\nGoing back through the security checkpoint was slow slow slow as well.  \n\nIn the future, I will either try to avoid this airport or make sure that the flights are within the same terminal.",0
"As a US Air guy with status I was expecting a lot more from this airport after not having visited for eight years.  It's not a dump but compared to the other US Air hub, Charlotte, it's a dump. \n\nThe food is meh, the terminal layout is meh.\n\nIt's easy to get to from downtown and Scottsdale which is a plus.\n\nThe rental car facility requires a bus transfer but it's pretty quick.\n\nMaybe there's magic in terminals one and two but three and four are horribly average with minimal places to plug in electronics and the bathrooms are straight from 1981.  bleh",0
"Bleh.  This isn't one of the better airports to fly into or depart from.  Not only is the interior in a serious need of a remodel, the eatery options are limited (with the exception of Terminal 4).  Couple that with the seasonal threat of thunderstorms and it adds up to an airport I try to avoid.  \n\nThe most craptastic feature of this airport is the \""""U\"""" shape of Terminal 4, with no direct connection between the A and D gates.  This isn't a big deal for people that connect on U.S. Air and Southwest since the airlines are clustered by carrier in the same or nearby gates, but if you have a multi-carrier trip (U.S. Air/Southwest combo for instance), have fun walking 20 minutes from the A to D gates.\n\nIf Phoenix is your destination, note that the off-site rental car counter takes 15-20 minutes to get to with the shuttle bus.",0
"Seeing that I fly out of PHL (Philadelphia International Airport) PHX is a dream.  This airport is huge, easy to get in and out of and has really nice TSA agents.  I really like how there are places to eat and shop prior to going through security so if you needed to wait and you're not flying, its very welcoming.",1
"In general Sky Harbor is lacking in almost every way.  It must be the most profitable major airport in the US because you can tell they don't spend any money making it a nice place.\n\nThis review has sections: Food, Terminal spaces quality, Security\n\nFood...\nSky Harbor really needs to step up the game making each terminal section have equal choice/quality of food. I'm not saying they all need 5 star places, just make them equal. This is a busy airport - get some decent places. Airports like Seattle, Denver, etc put Phoenix to shame\n\nOne gate area has only crappy hot dogs or burger king (barf king). I refuse to buy that swill.\n\nTerminals...\nAs Jasen F pointed out, the terminals are a dump. The ONLY exception is the Southwest spot in Terminal 4 which as been completely redone. Bravo to them... it is the only decent place in Sky Harbor.\n\nSecurity...\nThe one smart/good thing they did was put security at each terminal so there are more lanes overall and less bottlenecks. The bad thing is they use body scanners so this slows it down a ton... makes things 3 to 5 times longer per person.",0
"Don't fly through Phoenix. \n\nGetting from one gate to another required leaving the secure area, taking a bus, and going through security a second time, which in my case meant it took more than 45 minutes to get between connecting flights. Additionally, the planes here board 45 minutes before takeoff instead of 30 (the standard), so my 1.5 hour layover barely allowed me time to pee before boarding - nevermind finding anything to eat. \n\nThen we had a runway delay that meant sitting still for half an hour on what was supposed to be a 50 minute flight. To top it off, my bags didn't make it to my connecting flight, and are apparently still somewhere in Phoenix - a day later. \n\nBad, bad experience. Never routing through here, or with US Airways, again.",0
"Compared to the many airports I've visited, PHX is one of my favorites. \n\nThe main terminal before you go through security is super nice and filled with pretty mosaic decor, a Paradise Bakery, a full Starbucks, and many more enticing shops that will draw you in despite the lack of time you have to make it to your plane. But alas, another awesome win for those traveling here is the quick and painless, security checkpoint. Unless, of course, you are stuck behind a couple that has never flown before and have to keep getting turned around to walk back through the metal detector to take off the belt, oh, whoops you forgot to take out your wallet too? Oh and you need to now go back to remove your juicy track jacket AND take off your flip flops?! Silly, traveler, and yes, all of us are silently (but some not so silently) judging you. But, that's not really the airport's fault. Anyway, in the summer times I have seen complimentary paper booties for those to put on who wore flip flops\nand don't want to walk through barefoot, nice touch.\n\nAfter security it's a hit or miss on shops and/or restaurants depending what gate you have to go towards. Another one of the main bonuses of this airport is how clean it is and how well kept the bathrooms are! The staff working here are generally pretty happy and willing to help you out with any questions you might have. Oh, and Sky Harbor offers free wifi!",1
"Due to flight issues, I spent four hours in this airport, and thankfully this was a great airport to be stuck in!  It's actually a beautiful airport...super clean and beautiful artwork all around. \n\nIt's easy to navigate and has excellent food choices.  If you are in Terminal 4, you must eat at Paradise Bakery and Cafe! It is before you go through security.  Fresh muffins and lots of healthy sandwiches and salads.  There are also really cute shops and even an art gallery!  \n\nLuckily I kept myself busy and the 4 hours went by pretty quickly.",1
"This airport is fine. Gets the job done, but it is not an airport I would choose to spend an extended amount of time in.  There simply isn't much that is exciting to eat or buy here.  Most other good-sized airports that I have been in have much better dining and shopping options for those of us with layovers.",0
"We traveled through the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport this week for work and found the experience A-OK. Phoenix is a clean, modern airport with lots of shops and restaurants and easily navigated. There was no line at security and we had our shoes off and on in no time. No complaints or problems whatsoever.",1

"1. Who's idea was it to space out the terminals to point that there are only about 8 gates at each corner? which leads to...\n2. The food available at each corner is so limited and mundane that unless you have 2 hours to walk around, you're stuck eating at 1 of 3 options available. which leads to...\n3. I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE I AM!!! and...\n4. where are the seats? where are the outlets? where's the mofucking water fountain???\n\nYou'll be saying \""""Where\"""" a lot here.",0
"4-stars because it is really easy to get in and out of the airport without a lot of walking or long lines if you're a smoker and have some time between flights.\n\nI was really intrigued by the woman at the TSA checkpoint, who was reciting all sorts of travel tips in a TV Voice, but with no expression on her face.  She was really kind of amazing, and the contrast of her facial expression and her voice actually made me listen.\n\nNot many food choices, though...a couple more restaurants would be nice.",1
I don't mind the airport itself but the wait for baggage is ridiculous.  45 minute flight home from Vegas and 30+ minute wait on baggage. Insane!,0
"I've been through better but this one aint bad.  I love the smell of airports too.  It reminds me of going somewhere fun.  At least it does since I don't travel for work anymore.  Sky Harbor has the average food choices, has been decently upgraded, parking is OK.  I really don't have much to complain about.",1
"To hell with this airport and really, to hell with Arizona.\n\nThat hurts me to say, I met my wife while we both lived and worked at Grand Canyon, and I've spent a lot of time in mostly northern Arizona.  At one time I dreamed of retiring to a small ranch with lots of big dogs and Mount Humphreys looming in the distance.  No more, those days are long behind me.\n\nThe combination of my disgust with Phoenix - really just a hotter, dryer version of LA -  and the unseemly politics of people like Sheriff Joe Arpaio and Governor Brewer have  pretty much taken me to the point where I don't plan to set foot (or spend another dollar) in that state.\n\nThis airport blows.  It's huge, if you rented a car it succeeds in outdistancing even Providence in terms of how far you must travel to get your vehicle.  Plan on an extra half hour to take shuttle buses and then hunt for your car due to the extreme lack of effective signage and staff.\n\nAnd please tell me why the hell I'm paying for your football stadium.  Your team sucks, you have a (ridiculous) corporate sponsor for it,  so why are people who could not care less about the Arizona Cardinals paying a stadium surcharge?\n\nI'll continue to vote with my dollars, and none of them will be heading to Arizona.  As someone who flies a lot, all over the world, Sky Harbor is on my personal shit(hole) list.",0
"(1.75 stars) Continental uses Terminal 2 of PHX, which is smaller, older and a bit more worn than Terminals 3 or 4.  The dining spots are fewer, but TSA Security was a breeze on late afternoon Thursday; they were waiting for me.  Security here claims to not have all of the newest equipment, and as a result, they screen very carefully.  It has been at least two years since I've been asked to have the quart-sized ziplock bag of liquids removed from my carry-on bag.  Waiting areas are large and not well-lit.  Travel between terminals requires a shuttle bus, and they're somewhat slow.  This is one of the worst places to have connecting flights with mismatched airlines as the newer terminals are huge, and the older ones are poorly connected.  Car rental requires a shuttle bus to a central facility; allow at least 15 minutes.  All told, PHX is neither bad nor impressive.",0
"This airport is HUGE! It offers great restaurants, gift shops a lot of options for drinks and food. The restrooms are ok but usually crowded. The airport itself is well maintained clean and the staff are friendly. The most frustrating part of this airport is the baggage claim process. Numerous times I have waited close to 30 to 40 minutes for my baggage. Over the years I thought this would improve but it hasn't.",0
"Phoenix is not memorable and I've had some less desirable experiences here from what I do remember.  The food selections are limited (as others have stated), and the airport just looks so dated at the gates.  I hate hubs in general, and the fact that this is USAirways hub is even worse.  They even tried to stick me in some horror motel room because they oversold the flight...ugh.  The best part about the airport was leaving so I could enjoy my vacation at a Scottsdale resort.",0
"As a forewarning this review may be slightly biased because my home airport is SFO.\n\nI was there for an emergency flight so I needed internet access and a plug for my tablet. First off, the seating area for Continental Airlines is really small. To charge my tablet I had to go in a little tiny corner where I spotted a an outlet. There were other outlets on the floor, but they were all taken up. Even worse, there were other people standing around until it was available.\n\nOverall, the feel of the airport was outdated and definitely needed more outlets!",0
"It is so hard to come up for a rating for this airport because as a air traveler, it is really not that bad.  They have been making an effort in the last few years to make the place more comfortable.  Adding wi-fi, some better restaurants, etc.  And security lines are pretty short considering the volume of people they have going thru there on any given day.\n\nIt is the outside of the airport that is a big problem.  Picking up and dropping off people is a nightmare.  The cell phone lots have made this a little easier but they are so hard to find.  The access roads for this place are like a freakin' maze and the signage is not helpful at all.  Once you do pick up your friend/family member, trying to get out of the place is so frustrating.  Even though I have driven to this airport at least 50 times, I always seem to have trouble finding my way back to I-10 and usually end up coming out the west exit instead of the east one where I want to be.  It is insanely frustrating.  If you are not picking up/dropping off then you are in even worse shape.  The rental car facilities and long term offsite parking options are fantastic but most people from out of town simply can't find them and even if you've been there before it is a real challenge.\n\nI know it would be a major overhaul to improve the airport access but at least improve your road signs, please!",0
It's an airport......\n\nThe taxi guys were nice though.,0
"So this airport is known as the nicest.. that is pretty cool and the employees are definitely nice but that doesn't matter when its a huge pain to get from one terminal to the other.\n\nI happened to make the mistake of getting on the wrong bus from the rental car area..along with two other people. We ended up at the wrong terminal to find out that busses dont drive around to all of them. grrr..so we had to walk through the terminal to the other side and take another bus that takes you between terminals. This took quite a while... luckily I had the time, but one of the other people had to sprint to make his flight.\n\nThis is a bit surprising and annoying for what looks to be an airport with some newer renovations. They really should have some sort of terminal connect train.",0
"Arrving at Sky Harbor at 1AM was not the issue (it was empty), but my departure back home was almost a complete wreck.\n\nSo apparently this weekend, Nascar (among 1,000 other things) was in town.  I had a 12:40AM to ATL Monday morning.  Leaving Hohokam Park around 9PM (about 6-7 miles from SH), I didn't get to the f'n car rental center (a whole different story) until 10:30.  \n\nWho's genius idea was it to close the airport exit and re-direct traffic from a 4 lane to a one-lane bottleneck into the airport?  That could have been the dumbest, most inefficient thing I have seen since DC shut the interstate near RFK.  Traffic was unbelievable.  And I didn't realize it took another 15 minutes to get to the car rental \""""center\"""".\n\nAfter finally getting to the terminal, check in was slow, considering the amount of people they should have been expecting (they had red-eyes going to CHI, JFK, and ATL, amongst other places).  Getting to security was ridiculous- I would have rather gotten a handy from TSA then the circus they were running.  Apparently, waving my sunscreen in the air \""""who's is this?\""""  I should have told them it was my buttplug.   I told them, they said I could check it, but I couldn't let it go.  Cya, sunscreen.  \n\nAnother fascinating aspect was I had my cough syrup, hand sanitizer, and my lighter on me.  They could care less about the lighter.  The hand-gel - gone.  And my syrup, they made me take my stuff, and open it, they were testing it for God-only-knows. They didn't care about checking my ID to make sure the contents were mine though, just to make sure it wasn't on their list?  Is that not ass-backwards?\n\nFinally getting through, there wasn't shit open to eat or shop, a big no-no for people trying to get the hell home- I mean after taking 2 hours to go 6 miles that gets you hungry!\n\nThe actual airport itself was dated in some parts, but it was clean, its only saving grace.\n\nIMO, this place has a long ways to go to be a well oiled machine, which is a huge disappoinment being a gateway to the west.",0
"This is my regular stop coming from PHL to SFO/SJC. I wish I wouldn't stop here and either stop at O'Hare or Denver. However... from the time I have to leave, this is one of the cheaper flights available. \n\nWith a 2 hour layover there's not much to eat here in terms of good restaurants. There's a sports bar, couple sandwich places, CPK, and a burrito bar. The layout of terminal 4 is frustrating. To get from one side to the other without going back through security, you would have to take 6 walking escalators to get to the other shops and gates. Eg. Going form US Airways to Southwest Gates.\n\nThe whole airports needs an overhaul. With the brown looking carpets, and with the shops that are already closed for construction, it really does not feel modern. \n\nThe only good thing is that they have LCD monitors with Basketball/Sports playing waiting at the gates.",0
"I flew through PHX on my way to and from the West coast from Georgia. It has been a while since I've been at this airport.\n\nThis time I flew US Airways which pretty much dominates Terminal 4 - A & B Gates. The almost 60 gates are spread out into four wings connected by moving walkways.\n\nOn my way west, I arrived in the far A gate and my connecting flight was in the far B gate. I had an hour in between flights. This allowed me just enough time to casually walk the six or so moving walkways, use the restroom and grab a bottle of water. I must mention that I was also wearing heels, which slowed me down considerably since I haven't worn heels in a long time! So, if you are traveling with children, aren't fast on your feet or want time to grab some food, I would recommend booking flights that have a longer connection time.\n\nOn my way back, I had an hour again but was in comfortable shoes; so, I was able to quickly walk between the wings with time enough to grab a snack. The only issue I had was that my departing gate was in the end of the wing. The gates are closer together and the waiting area is smaller. Out of the four or five gates within view, at least three of them were attempting to board at the same time. This caused some confusion amongst the crowd. I think it would be smart to stagger departing flights or at least have the announcers say the flight number every time they make an announcement. That's more of a problem for US Airways, but I thought it would be helpful to warn people to be aware of other departing flight announcements.",1

"My experience here is not one that has a lot to cover. I was pretty much in and out here so I can't really give a glowing report. Usual fashion the better restaurants are in the main terminal and if you head out to security you end up on one of the satelites and then you have limited selections. I do wish that there were more connections ports for power as many people were wainting in line to power their various mobile devices. I have been in many a better airport than this, nothing overly negative, just nothing to write home about.",0
"This place used to be better, but lately, it's turning into a bus stop in the not so good section of town.\n\nI'm just referring to using PHX as a change planes location, not as a start/final destination.\n\nServices offered while waiting for your next flight?  Blah.  Nice that the seats don't have the arm rests on them, so if you can, there is the possibility of stretching out.  Don't do it if the gate is packed.\n\nSomeone needs to offer the local restaurants an incentive to open up in the airport here, there are lots of great places to eat in and around PHX....just none at the airport.",0
"This airport does not have many amenities, especially in terminal 2.  They have improve what is there but there is mostly just a bunch of wasted space because Alaska Airlines only has 6 or 7 flights per day in and out of here and if you have time to kill, bring a good book or a fully charged laptop so you will have something to occupy yourself with!!",0

Best airport I've been to in awhile, and I travel a lot!",1
As a frequent flier especially out of Phoenix i have to be honest that Sky Harbor is just a terrible Airport. Lately there has been a ton of construction that makes it impossible to get around and the signs for where the terminals are located just dont work. If your looking for which one of the 4 terminals your plane is leaving from you better know before you get there because your not going to find a sign that tells you. Luckily i know the airport well but its just a terrible system. THough they are now doing some construction to try and fix things (I hope).\n\nParking is a mess with the spiral parking garages and getting in. The one nice thing is the cell phone waiting lots that are actually really useful and pretty accommodating for a large airport. Parking cheap is just a good distance away on washington and is worth it if you have the time and AAA discounts. \n\nInside the airport needs updating but is still better than many of the other airport in the country. Overall the inside is one of the best part of the airport with a good amount of places to eat and drink and alright walking between the different gates. Overall Sky harbor is a low level to middle of the pack airport that is going through some hopefully necessary upgrades but a mess otherwise especially for out of town people.,0
"I have been to Phoenix airport 3 times, all from connecting flights so I have never been through their security, parking, transportation, etc.  This airport is very clean and easy to get around.

One star because zero isn't an option. I hate picking people up OR dropping them off here but far worse is having to FLY to or from here. Wheelchair service is a joke... It already is awful to need thus service they should make it easier and not make you feel like garbage for needing it. \n\nThen there's the restrooms. Both on the way out and on return they were worse than most gas stations I've visited. Gross. I would rather drive. At least as far as a better airport.,0
"Another great airport, quick, clean, and easy to get in and out. The only thing that sucks now is the long hual to the rental car place. But not that big of a deal!!",1
"I found the layout of this airport maddening, especially it's rental car pick-up and return.  The rental car area is miles from the actual airport and there was no express way for the buses to get in and out.  It is an extraordinarily inefficient mousetrap that adds on at least 20 minutes to your commute.  On top of that, the rental vehicles are expensive, and there isn't a gas station remotely near the rental car return center.  If you are local or a frequent traveler you probably figure all of this stuff out, but if you are a first timer, it is very frustrating.\n\nThis could have just been the day I was there, but the security lines were woefully understaffed.  They only had 2 of 6 lines running the day I was there.  Because of this, a bottleneck was being caused by the priority treatment that families, those in wheelchairs, and business class elite receive.  I am all for this preferential treatment, that wasn't the problem, but because the line moved so slow, there were periods of time where these were the only folks who were moving through at all.  The security folks were having a tough time simply keeping up with them.  It took 45 minutes to get through a line that was only 50% full.  I perish the thought of  what it would be like if they had a more substantial group of travelers.\n\nOn the plus side, I found the airport clean, but that is a base expectation for an airport.  There were good food options in the terminal, but not at the gate.  Because of the aforementioned security bottleneck, you would be crazy on eating anywhere but your gate for fear of missing your flight.\n\nIn the Terminal 4 section of Southwest, there was a bar and grill.  The food was expensive, and the menu very limited.  In spite of this massive airport, people were wedged in to small areas with virtually no room to move.  I felt like I was eating on child sized furniture.",0
"PHX:\n\nRight now, the Phoenix airport is more of a 2 star airport, but it is undergoing a lot of renovations so I applaud the effort.  Sky Harbor International has an incredibly long way to go before it can be considered in the same class as some of the nicer international airports, let alone inside the U.S.  The terminals feel drab and dingy.  The old Southwestern-patterned carpets don't help, though there are eye-pleasing murals decorating the walls of some concourses.  Relatively low ceilings and limited window views of the outside coupled with dense passenger traffic can make some sections of this airport feel downright claustrophobic.\n\nSeriously though, entering this airport feels like taking a step back in time.  Remember the retro Taco Time theme of brown and burnt orange?  That's what Sky Harbor feels like.  Speaking of food, the restaurant selection here is abysmal.  Fortunately, the aforementioned renovations include the addition of several new eateries including local concepts.  There's currently a lot of on-going construction.\n\nAt least the future is bright for Phoenicians.\n\nFree Wi-Fi.",0
"The more I travel, the more thankful I am for my home airport. It is a clean venue featuring interesting decor, tasty food and drink (local faves: Sauce, Press Coffee) and I have never had a terribly long wait at security.",1
"A very meh airport. I recently had to make two layovers here and I've got to say, it's not a great layover airport. Horrible food options and very few of them within reasonable walking distance so if you don't have alot of time, you're screwed. One of the most miserable things here was the lack of seating and overall cramped atmosphere in the gate areas. They cramp a dozen gates in a small area and it's a mess. Lines for different flights intertwining and the like. \n\nThe disorganization mixed with flight delays just made for a very stressful flight.",0
I like this airport due to the easily accessible lounges. If you don't have a lounge pass then this place can be a lame spot. Although there are plenty of food and beverage options - the airport is spread out and you need time to0 get from one terminal to the other - especially if you are crossing the country. The regional stuff usually stays in one terminal - for us  - the B terminal. The terminal lounge in B only stays open until 8 pm.,1
"After my fourth visit here I no longer can give this airport a pass for a bad day. \n\nIt's 7pm, not a shop or restaurant is open, this has been every trip. So much for eating on a layover. \n\nGates and airport in general are dingy and unkempt, dirty carpets, full trash cans, funny smell.",0

Seriously, the furniture, decor, and the monitors are completely from \""""Back to the Future.\"""" I couldn't believe my eyes, it is not 2012?  \"""" I'm not picky about my airport interior design, but it's just depressing here.\"""" -MacRae O. said it best  \n\nI didn't have a long layover so I can't comment on the phone options. There is WiFi and no hassle so that is why it gets two stars, but hopefully they will have more updates in the future.",0
"I can't think of a major airport I would give more than 4 stars to, so this one ranks pretty high for me. \nSky Harbor is HUGE! Do not book a connection for under one hour unless you thrive on stress and love spending time in airports.\nThis review is for Terminal 4 the USAirways terminal  There is a nice variety of food and shopping options past security. The gate areas are bright and open and the available seating is adequate. The corridors are usually easy to navigate although it can get quite crowded at times. Everything is well marked. Generally the staff, both airport and airline, are friendly and helpful. \nThere is free wifi. A big plus for me. A few more convenient outlets/charging stations would be nice. \nAll in all this is not a bad airport to have to spend time in between flights.",1
"Luckily, I didn't have to travel far to make my connecting flight. And for this, I thank you, Phoenix.\n\nMy brief layover was pleasant as the employees were kind and the flight was on time.  Hopefully, next time I can grace Phoenix with my presence for a little while longer.",1
"B/C I can get to this airport using public transportation ill give it 4 stars, b/c i got a ticket from picking up my luggage for 5 seconds because it came in late and i got a ticket -2 and i was about to get towed in less than 5 mins i hate this place lol!!",0
"I haven't been to many airports in my life, so of the few that I've been to, Sky Harbor is one of the better ones. And here's why: outlet stations. If you have any kind of electronic device that sometimes acts as an extra appendage, you can appreciate the sight of a row of outlets in an airport. I can't tell you how many times I've arrived at the airport, realized my cell battery was low and panicked at the thought of my phone dying before take off and not having any buffer to airplane small talk.\n\nSky Harbor is clean and efficient with helpful signage as airport signage should be. I think I've always flown out of B or C gate and the food options are pretty good-better than your standard airport cuisine. Of course the prices are airport-appropriate (see: highway robbery), but should you be stuck there for an extended period of time, the eats won't be limited to mystery meat from the golden arches. Pretty much every restaurant I saw had a bar which is great for those of us with air travel anxiety. \n\nI don't mind stopping through Sky Harbor and should I get stuck there, I think it's one of the better airports to get stuck in.",1
"This airport really sucks.  The layout for one is ridiculous.  I felt like we spent most of our two hour layover walking from one terminal to the next just to grab a quick meal.  The saving grace was Paradise Cafe.  It was the only high quality and decently priced place to get a meal that both my child and I would like.  If you're traveling alone I'm sure you can find other places but having a kid really limits the choices!  Also they have a complete lack of power outlets!  Most airports these days have a long row of nice leather chairs with outlets in the arm, but PHX is lacking this.  You just have to hope you can get a seat by one of the columns with an outlet in it, but then you get the death stare from ten other people when you plug in!",0
Its an air port\nEverything is over priced\nThe staff is under manned\nElectric outlets are few and inconveniently placed\n\nWhat ever it gets me from A to B by bicecting the gravitational forces of the flux capacitor. Fuck u science!,1
Not a fan of the airport being 10 miles away from car rental... Easy to get around but plan extra time for the shuttle ride.,0
"PHX is truly one of the worst airports out there. It's outdated, too small for the crowd, and amenities are definitely lacking. It just doesn't get much worse than this airport.\n\nAlso the security lines are just crazy abnormally long during odd hours of the days.... More so than other airports of similar size. So make sure you have enough time planned in advanced when getting through this airport.",0
"Rental car review.\n\n118 degrees.  Standing outside in the heat waiting for a bus.  10 minutes go by and I have seen 3 busses leave with out of service signs.  Another 10 minutes pass and no active duty busses.  Finally, a bus!  We have a packed bus and the driver is just standing outside.  5 minutes later he comes back on the bus and we drive 10 miles an hour the whole way to the terminal.\n\nPHX...pay attention.  Business travelers do not appreciate being left in the heat for 20 minutes watching out of service busses pass by.",0
"I've flown into and out of Phoenix airport several times in my life.  Well, not me, I've been inside a plane, but you already knew that.\n\nAnyway, the airport is clean, the people working there are nice, and it's one of the major hubs for US Airways.  The terminal we were in had a Starbucks, a Burger King, a Cinnibon and a Mexican spot.  There were a couple of gift shops with typical Arizona schwag (t-shirts, mugs, etc.).  They also had books for people who forgot to bring their own.\n\nWe were delayed for 5 hours due to weather on the East Coast which sucked, but wasn't their fault.  They fed us snacks for free and kept us updated every 15-30 minutes or so.  \n\nAnyway, this isn't one of those airports with armrests on their chairs so it was easy, albeit uncomfortable, to take a nap.  Travel well, my friends!",1
NEEDS BETTER FOOD!!! Even Oakland upgraded... get with it Phoenix!!!,0
"This has to be one of the worst airports ever!  If you get dropped off (or picked up), you get yelled at for taking too long. Then they have double \""""parking\"""" on drop off so you get yelled out for not being able to move. Huh?  Once inside you're kind of on your own...not a lot of signs to direct you to the right place. If you ask for help, you will more than likely be \""""greeted\"""" with an unfriendly \""""yeah\"""".  The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because they do have free wifi.",0
"I used to live in Arizona and have flown out of here, as well as flown through here as a layover so I have had the pleasure of experiencing each scenario of being a traveler in this airport.\n\nWhen flying out of here to go to Vegas, I parked pretty far away, and had a bus shuttle me into the airport. This was a fast and painless experience and only took about 10 minutes total. Once I got into the airport and got my boarding pass I went through security check within about 5 minutes. There were a lot of people there, however, the people from TSA were working fast and were still checking everything from what it seemed to me at least. So within 20 minutes of arriving to the airport I am already inside the airport and able to get to my terminal if I were in a hurry.\n\nSince I wasn't in a hurry because I give myself plenty of time to get to my destination when flying, I ended up getting something to eat at Round Table Pizza. This airport has a lot of shops and restaurants to choose from that will keep you occupied or get you what you want in a flash if you're in a hurry. I always find friendly people here that start up random conversations which I particularly enjoy doing while I travel, it makes the time fly by (pun intended).\n\nWhen I have flown through here from when I moved back to Buffalo, I was happy to be back to my favorite place I have ever lived in my life. I walked around in here until my flight was boarding just looking at the great looking landscape that is surrounding you outside. There are some hot spots in the airport that you can feel the heat beating through with the sun throwing down 110 degree heat, but it's a nice feeling of being back. The entire airport is obviously air conditioned, but it's nice to have Arizona throw me some nostalgic beams of heat to remind me what this great state does best, melt everything! hehe.\n\nOverall this is my favorite airport I've ever been to, and there's a reason it's called the Friendliest Airport....because everyone here is very nice, and helpful. I am surprised at the reviews here, but I guess you can't please everyone!",1
"Great restaurants here, but can they get a flight out on time?  Leaving PHX for SFO was almost an hour late and returning to HNL from PHX was 40 minutes late.\n\nGeez...at least I was able to get there and didn't have other connecting flights.",0
"NIce airport, decent amount of shops but could use more variety. Lately they've been revamping their restaurants and getting some way tastier options.",1
"Sky Harbor is one poor gateway to the city of Phoenix and the Valley of the Sun.  It is outdated, super crowded, it feels dirty and it is the home of US Airways, the biggest carrier in and out of this airport.\n\nTerminal 4 is configured rather poorly.  The terminal reminds me of a backwards E, like the second E in EMIN3M, except that there is another prong to the backwards E.  The concourses are not spacious at all, the seating limited, and consequently the crowds spill out into the walkway areas.\n.  \nTo go from one end of Terminal 4 to the other necessitates using really narrow moving walkways which are on the spine of the E.  It is really hard to maneuver if you want to pass the throngs given the limited space.  The distances are long, the bruises will be many, either to you but most likely given by you as you negotiate your way between flights.\n\nThe other thing that must be mentioned is that Sky Harbor is not a business person's airport but rather a tourist airport.  I think that contributes a lot to the chaos.  When an airport is full of amateurs, like Sky Harbor, there are bottlenecks of humanity in all the wrong places.  Further exacerbating the tourist nature of this airport are the snowbirds who flock here so that they can seek skin cancer in all months of the year, not just summer in their native habitats of the Upper Midwest.\n\nGet going on the remodel since it is long overdue and make sure you take in mind the tourists and the business traveler when updating this airport.",0
I expected more from Phoenix (I don't know why).  The terminals are SOOOOO far from each other and the skyshuttle isn't open yet so depending on the length of your layover you may get some exercise from running.  Flew on US Airways and didn't find many food options in a few terminals which was disappointing.  Not impressed.,0
"Had to stop here for connecting flight coming from cancun. After customs, u have to physically get ur luggage (the one u checked-in) from the carousel, then check it again for your connecting flight. The problem i encountered was going to security again to go to the gate for my connecting flight. The security specifically shouted to everybody that we need to take out all liquid we brought and place it on top of our bags as it entered into the scanner. This caused so much hassle because i didnt expect they demand such a thing. I fly a lot and this was the first time they demand such. Of course since i didnt know, the specific liquid (mouthwash) was at the bottom of my bag and i have to remove all my stuff out of the bag to get it..urgghhhh!!",0
"Short Answer: Meh.\n\nLong Answer: Old.  Smelly.  Terminals that are absurdly far from each other. Yup, just about what I expected from Phoenix.\n\nI can't really HATE on the place: my flight wasn't delayed for example.  The AC didn't seem to be working well, but it's hot outside and that happens.\n\nBut this is US Air's hub: I expected at least more than one restaurant every 200 ft.  The whole thing feels like it's slowly gotten bigger and bigger with no thought for central planning.  \n\nThe free WiFi is cool but a lot of airports have that now too.  It's ok, jut not anything exciting.",0
"Living in Yuma, AZ I pretty much fly out of Phoenix every time I travel.  The airport is huge.  If you are flying to or from Yuma put your running shoes on.  Connecting times in addition to delays will sometimes leave you with 10 minutes to get to the next gate that is like 1/4 mile away.  My suggestion is to flag down one of those speedy cart guys.  food options are decent.  there's a cool Tex-mex place in Terminal A.",0
"The free wifi rocks here. And like the other reviewers, not too crowded and a lot of charging stations in the southwest terminal!",1
"Terminal 3 doesn't have the most intuitive signs especially when you need to exit to change terminals.  However, the airport tram is being built right now and parts should be open in the next year or so.\n  Internet is spotty most likely due to number of users.  If you desperately need to get work done, don't count on getting a stable signal in parts of this airport.  However WiFi is Free",0
"Good food, easy to travel in and out of. I enjoy flying out of this airport.",1
"Waited at the gate on the plane for a half hour because we arrived early. What? One concourse, 8pm, 50 hungry people, one eatery, on a Friday evening makes a grumpy traveler-plus, I had to search around for a bit to find a screen to find where my connecting flight was. -Not my favorite airport.",0
"Clean and planes show up periodically, cool",1
"Unlike other airports I've been in where your options for food are your massive conglomerate chain restaurants like McDonald's and Burger King, Sky Harbor has a nice array of more local, higher quality restaurants for you to choose from (e.g., La Grande Orange, Olive and Ivy, Barrio Cafe), as well as some healthier choices compared to eating a greasy burger and fries (e.g., Paradise Bakery).  There are a lot of good parking options, whether you choose the airport's own parking lot or private lots that provide shuttle service.  I also appreciate the free wi-fi, it definitely helps whittle the time away while you are waiting for your flight!",1
"I don't mind this airport.  I'm here more often than other locations since it's a hub for the place I always travel back and forth to/from.\n\nI like this airport because it's always pretty dead, or at least it looks that way.  There are lots of food options and usually seating, (or at least there has been when I've been there).  \n\nMy only complaint is that the walk from terminal to terminal is SOOOOO long.  Literally every time I've gone through this airport, I've walked from one end to the other.  It's such a long trip, and if you're on a connecting flight with a short amount of time to make it there, it can be stressful.",1
"Airport is nice, but getting here from Sedona was not fun. Gps took us to some private airport and we missed our flight. Don.\""""t trust your GPS",1
"Dirty, grungy, 80s carpet with the matching smell. This airport is very old (or old looking) the food courts serve terrible food and the restaurant in there are not much better. I have seen better looking airports in develpoing countries",0
"This airport is easy to navigate however their gate system for us air SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!  I came in at the end of the concourse at a rotunda at gate B12. I only had to go a few gates over, to gate B17 I was like kewl I won't have to walk far.  NOPE!!!!  I had to walk all the way back up the concourse to gate B1, and take the HUGE walkway to the other concourse where the rest of the B gates are. WHAT A BAD DESIGN",0
"I flew into the Phoenix airport on a Southwest flight. I had a connecting flight in another terminal but it was so frustrating to get to in this weird airport. Don't get me wrong, it's modern and very beautiful. There are gorgeous views of the red rocks and mountains of Phoenix. But all that beauty is overshadowed by the poorly organized airport. All of the information boards only provided flight information for that terminal. Which is great if you're staying in one terminal but when you have a connecting flight or you're switching carriers then it's really frustrating. There should be more information available. \n\nAlso, there was no way for me to find a way to another terminal. There are no information booths and if there was then it was well hidden from me. I finally asked a TSA security guy if he could help me find my flight. He told me I'd have to take a shuttle to another terminal. I was surprised that in 2012 this airport that seems so modern did not have a train that connected all of the terminals. My surprise quickly turned to anger because if you are switching terminals then you must go through security again! I had purchased jam at the airport and presented my receipt showing that it was a purchase within the airport but it was still confiscated. Dumb.\n\nPhoenix, please embrace all parts of modernity and build a freaking tram between terminals.",0
"A confusing airport to drive in and out of, but flying in is pretty easy and the baggage claim is all in one spot. I had an easy time getting in as well to check in for my flight, but be prepared to walk from one side to another if you have to switch gates. I like the free wifi and that there are food options if you need a quick bite.",0
"I travel on a regular basis and have seen the best and the worst airports. I have not exactly seen it all, but enough, and Sky Harbor ranks in the top ten in my book. It is international yet has a small feel to it, meaning it is easy to get around in, and has quick security lines most all of the time in my experience. \n\nAfter reading some of the other reviews, I feel like I need to say that I have never had to connect here, so that is not a part of this review.",1
"If you are active or family of the military check out the new USO suite in Terminal 4. Also, I was most impressed with the ,\""""Lost and Found\"""" service I received last week. They literally got back to me in less than an hour. Nice job Sky Harbor! I can't wait until the Sky Train opens too.",1
If you fly US Airways be prepared for a huge line. This Airport/Airline combo doesn't learn or care to learn that they are broken. More machines and a couple more people would help make the baggage/ticket process less painful.,0
"While riding the moving walkway I wondered why Sky Harbor was built in such a way that it's always a far walk from gate to gate. Maybe there wasn't a lot of land to make longer rows of gates, or they couldn't use a curved or circular system instead of wing after wing after wing of gates.\n\nI landed in A Terminal and did the math in my head on board that there were maybe 10 gates between where I landed to where I was leaving from, but it turned out to be in a whole different wing which was probably 10 to 15 minutes away via two moving walkways and a pretty good walk down two corridors of gates.\n\nOnce you arrive at your gate there are few chairs and fewer outlets to recharge your phone or iPod.  Some of the gates are jammed together so it's hard to tell which gate is which and which flight is departing.  It's the usual set of shops with some newer food choices none of which have so far been outstanding.  Even the club closes relatively early.\n\nSo I always dread changing planes in Phoenix unless I check all my bags and have a very small carryon and have plenty of time to get from gate to gate and then my flight leaves almost right away.  My vision of hell is being loaded down with bags and trying to change planes in Phoenix with little time to spare and then once getting to the gate discovering my flight has been delayed... something to which anyone who has flown through Sky Harbor can certainly relate!",0
"Probably my least favorite major west coast Airport because of its lack of amenities, long waits on the runway, always using US Airways here and I feel like this place has the most planes being shut down with service problems than any other airport around. (I understand heat is an issue)",0
"This airport is one of the worst I've ever been to, in terms of layout. The only positive thing is that there are so many entry points into the four (FOUR) different terminals that the wait to get through TSA is decently short.\nDid I mention that the four terminals are not connected in any way? Means that, if you have a connecting flight with a different airline, be sure you have at least two hours between flights so you can get from terminal to terminal.",0
"On my way to Las Vegas my US Air flight 688 stopped at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport Gate A37 located in Terminal 4. The airport has three main terminals: Terminal 2, Terminal 3 and Terminal 4. My connecting flight 6 departed from Gate A3 so I had to walk from one section of Terminal 4 to the other section of Terminal 4. It took about 10 minutes to walk including a moving walkway from Gate A37 to A3.\n\nWhen I arrived to Gate A3 in time the boarding process was delayed due to the late arrival of the crew for my connecting flight to Vegas. What else is new? So many variables regarding flight arrival and departures. This is the norm.\n\nPHX is quite nice while I waited for my flight to board.\n\nIn the end my connecting flight was on time to Las Vegas, which is built into the flight schedules these days.",1
"Thanks YELP users.  We searched rental car agency in Scottsdale before choosing this one. Took the bus over from the terminal, the staff here was fast and friendly, we were in and out in minutes. We haven't rented a car in a very long time, but this was super easy, \n\nWhen driving out of the rental car lot, the oil light came on.  We continued on to our hotel and decided we would check the oil when we got there.  The next day, we called the Enterprise office and told them about the oil light.  The young man checked the records, said it had an oil change two days before.  No worries.  We never did check the oil until we arrived in Flagstaff, 175+ miles since picking it up.  Pulling off the interstate at Flagstaff, the motor began coughing.  We called the Flagstaff office and they brought over another car for us right away.  Were the same kind of friendly easy to work with folks we met in Scottsdale.  \n\nWe turned the second car in at the airport in Las Vegas.  We didn't have the same car as our paperwork, we had no paperwork for the second car.  We were afraid it would either be super easy or super intense once we turned the car in.  The assistant Manager, Nick, greeted us and thanked us, sent us on our way.  The easiest thing ever!",1
"Like most airports this place is congested with not enough seating or restrooms. So that is average.  I give it one star for the Rental Car Center.  It's the worst in the USA and maybe the world.  First off you have to wait in a long line outside in PHX heat, dust and car pollution.  After you catch one of the infrequent buses they drive you some place close to Tucson.  Dropping off is a bit better but you still have a long bus ride to the terminal.  Great way to cut back on traffic though as next time I will get a taxi.  Or maybe just take a taxi to the rental car center....",0
"So..yes I live in AZ...not my first choice.  I am a Cali girl through and through...but one of the best things about Phoenix (if you're a traveler) is the outstanding PHX airport.  No other airport can hold a candle to the ease, convenience, parking, cleanliness, even aesthetics of this airport.  Hardly any trouble ever going through TSA, parking is always a breeze...terminals have very nice amenities (my one exception is the Jet Blue terminal shops close way too early and so the midnight JFK flight one cannot purchase water, or anything).  And of course PHX is wonderfully located and offers tons of nonstops.  So although Arizona is a nice place to visit (or in my case plan conferences) and living here is a challenge..the ease of PHX is one huge plus.  Do you HEAR ME DFW????? Miami????",1
"A very good airport.  I've flown in and out of PHX and picked folks up from the airport.  In all instances customer service was good, parking was easy, and navigating around was a breeze.  Thumbs up, I am a fan.",1
"The efficiency with which the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport runs should be a template to other airports that are similarly large in size and traffic. The rental car facility--which is newly built-- isn't too far from the main terminal and there are always shuttles running between the two. The airport is clean and the dining options are above average for an airport, I mean they really have gone a bit above and beyond to make your experience different from the rest. Lots of shops and the flow and directional signage is top-notch.",1
One of the easier airports to access.   Fair selection of food.  Always seems pretty clean.  Easy security access.  Friendly gate agents.  I never mind flying through here.,1
This is a great airport. Easy to navigate and plenty of bars.,1
"Another poor experience at ole PHX.  New to me is that the car rental facility is not on airport property, it's about a 20 minute bus ride which I think is actually in New Mexico.  So in addition to my previous observations, you can add another hour to your day if you plan to rent a car.\n\nFor an international airport, they sure act like a small city airport...",0
Terminal 3 has got to be the worst terminal at Sky Harbor. Not 1 store was open and it was only 10:30pm. There is only 1 vending machine and it had no water!! We are in the desert right?  The staff was completely rude and not helpful! If I never come back to this airport it will be too soon. Stay away.,0
"Most confusing airport ever! I've been to quite a few airports and I've never seen an airport so difficult to navigate, that includes walking around inside and driving on the roads outside.  Just very poor signage.  Airport is nicely updated though...",0
"Woah...PHX is soooo much bigger than my hometown SMF! Nothing wrong with that; just different :)\n\nFlying in, we deplaned in Terminal C, which one could obviously tell was an old terminal...small, dated looking, hardly anywhere to sit or get something to eat. And of course a marathon walk to the baggage area where we met our ride. \n\nFlying out, we boarded in the lovely, remodeled, up-to-date, lots of refreshment options, airy, open, Terminal D. \n\nPretty much night and day between coming in thru a C gate and leaving thru a D gate!",1
"Not a horrible place, but certainly not good.\n\nI landed in one concourse of the A terminal and flew out of another within the same terminal.  I walked through the first and saw several food options which gave me hope for my options near my departure gate.  Unfortunately after my long walk to the other concourse I found there to be very limited options.  This I cannot understand.  Both concourses had a similar number of gates, yet one was loaded with options and the other completely lacked them.  Of course by the time i walked to my departure gate I did not have time to wander back to the other concourse, so I settled for a lesser option near my gate.\n\nJust hope you do not have to change terminals or rent a car.  Either requires a bus trip.  That is a big pet peeve of mine.  At least you do not have to take a train like in Atlanta or Denver.\n\nThe last issue I will cover in this review is the fact that Southwest and US Airways hold most of the spots at this airport.  That is enough reason not to fly here.",0
"You guys are too kind.  MacRae's review was on the mark but conceded one too many stars.\n\nThis is 1985.  Old, ugly, worn out, and dirty.  Time to replace the carpet and the furniture, y'all.\n\nIn 1985 no one had laptops, phones, kindles, and notebooks to charge.  In 2013 they do, and \""""Sky Harbor\"""" hasn't adapted. Does the general manager ever wonder why people are sitting on the floor by the wall outlets.  There was one charging station that I saw, but it didn't work.\n\nDid I mention that the waiting areas at the gates weren't large enough for the number of people on the flight?\n\nThere is free WiFi.  And unlike SD, there is more than one runway.",0
Beware! If you are flying on a Sunday make sure to get to this airport two hours early. I made the mistake of showing up an hour before my flight and I missed my flight back to Sacramento due to the long lines and the amount of people in the airport. It was a nightmare and I had to spend all day in airports due to this. Be prepared for a long wait!,0
"Can I give no stars? This airport needs to be torn down and rebuilt. It feels like it was designed by some kids on a beach somewhere. It's poorly marked, nothing was open, it was spring break for some but all the vending machines were about empty. Driving into Phoenix would be much better.",0
Es'cuse me Phoenix airport...I must thank you for having less expensive food options compared to Dallas Love Field. Dallas wanted to charge me $4.75 for a regular sized Gatorade- I'll wait. You Phoenix only charged me $2 for the same drink. You also have 24 hour restaurants!! My tummy thanks you!,1
"This is one of my favorite airports.....easy to get around, great places to eat and the best part is the fact that I never have delay issues here.",1
"TSA at Phoenix Airport (actually at most airports)\n\nLeaving Phoenix is hard enough, but when the lines to check your baggage seem endless and confusing - you just want to turn around and go back to the resort. \n\nFrom what I saw of this airport, it's typical - nothing really to write home about. Basic food and drinks - basic gifts and such, but then - you hit this incredible line. This time it was on the Southwest side!\n\nLuckily there was someone who knew the routine and guided me to the correct long line. Once to the kiosk, a quick scan of my boarding pass had things moving right along. However, the movement was slow once my bags were tagged, because they couldn't put them on the belt - I needed to take them to a holding area - 6 bags checked - 2 arrived in Buffalo.\n\nI have been told it was TSA's security conveyor belts that caused the problem - instead of 4 running they were down to 1. I'm not sure who's issue it was, but it became mine as soon as my bags on a nonstop flight didn't arrive at my destination with me.\n\nTSA stands for Transportation Security Administration, but I like to refer to it as Terrible Service A-holes! I'm not sure how one is selected to work for the TSA, but I don't think it takes much - at least not for some of the positions. \n\nDepending on what gate you are departing from - here are some tips:\n1) Starbucks is right after security - get it there\n2) Food - eat before you pass security as selections are slim after that\n3) Don't check your bags if you want them at your final destination with you\n4) Don't expect much from TSA\n5) Don't argue with anyone in the airport\n6) Drive whenever possible\n\nI really believe that the best picture for this airport would be a lot of TSA folks standing around doing nothing with huge lines behind them!",0
"Unimpressed.  This airport is carpeted which simply grosses me out.  In addition, there are not that many food options passed security.  I know we won't starve but there is nothing healthy and at 8 AM, very limited options for something more savory than breakfast.\n\nThe airport is also confusing.  There is no efficient way to navigate between major terminals.  To rent a car, you have to board a shuttle and ride for 20 minutes. It's obnoxious.  \n\nThe USAir check in was also a cluster with three different sections offering three different services which made it MORE confusing than it needed to be to simply check in with luggage.  Annoying.\n\nMy patience is never on point at an airport but in this case, they need to take some notes from IND.\n\nOn the upside, Wi-Fi is free (which is rare).",0
If I could give 0 stars I would but I cant. Yelp should change this feature. Worst customer service experience Ive ever had. Needed to catch a flight for a funeral. I show and the line is long which is understandable. After a half hour I go to enter my info and it says that its to late to check bags. Okay no problem. The lady says can you go talk to the agent. Sure \n\nWhen I get there 2 people are in line. Over the next hour I cant believe what takes place. They are talking to the 2 people ahead of me about world events etc. There is a time and place for that shit and its not at the airport. When I finally get up there they tell me that I will miss my flight. Im glad they pointed out he obvious and I say it wouldn't have happened if you didn't take an hour helping the other 2 people. Worst service ever I will plan on driving in the future.,0
I land in Terminal C and have to get to Terminal D.\nShouldn't be too hard...\n\n3 MILES LATER I FINALLY ARRIVE.\n\nWhy are the terminals so flipping far apart?! I have a 50 minute layover and I spent nearly 20 min dashing to my gate!\n\nBoo.,0
Love this airport!  Quick and easy!,1
"Stupid bitches made me miss my damn flight and I had to wait 3 hours for the next. Here's what happened.\n\n1) Take a flight out of Chicago and get to Phoenix at 7am, next flight leaves at 7:30 so the gate closes at 7:20 and people on the plane act like grabbing your shit and getting off is rocket science, so I have to wait 10 minutes\n\n2) Proceed to change gate TWICE within' that 20 minute window, and make sure they're on the opposite sides of the airport\n\n3) Get to gate as they're closing the gate.\n\n4) Bitchy US Airways attendant told me she couldn't let me on cause she gave my seat to someone on standby and told me she made last call for boarding, so I told her my plane didn't land until 7 in which she replied \""""oh\""""\n\n5) Same Bitchy ass US Airways broad working the front desk telling me I'm on an awards ticket so for the next flight so she has to see if I'm even \""""eligible\"""" to get on it. Prints my new ticket and tells me it's in 3 hours.\n\n6) Change the gate on my NEW ticket AGAIN...TWICE! (I learned my lesson previously so good thing I checked in)\n\n7) Ate a nasty ass salad for $8.99 and a $3 water, and waited for 3 hours.\n\n8) Got on next flight and left.\n\nFuck you, Phoenix International piece of shit. Never again.",0
"My recent experience at Phoenix wasn't the greatest.  I was connecting there and, as usual, we were behind schedule and they decided my connecting flight would be in another terminal WAY WAY WAY at the other end of the airport.  Gotta love these connecting itineraries.  Anyways, we were rushing and the one impression this airport left on me was that their moving walkways are way too small.\n\nThe moving walkways are literally the width of 1.5 people without luggage.  Add luggage and there is no utility to the \""""stand right, walk left\"""" display they always hang overhead.  People chose to stand on the walkway, talking on their cellphones while their luggage is taking up the whole space.  Obviously, running while on a moving walkway is a much faster way to make your connecting flight, but not if you are caught behind someone chatting up a storm on their \""""cool\"""" bluetooth headset, not listening to you huffing and puffing right behind them.  \n\nLuckily, we made our flight, and I have yet to check out the restaurants and shops here, but my impression so far is this is the last place I want to connect.  Unless I have a 4 hour layover and have ample time to walk a mile or two, while talking and looking cool and ignoring others.  This would be the perfect airport to do that.",0
"This really is America's Friendliest Airport! Always great service everywhere you turn here and very user friendly. I love it here and maybe I'm a bit biased now that I live here but I lived in Las Vegas for 24 years and I really don't care for that airport so maybe not biased?! Even before I lived here in Phoenix I always appreciated it here because once you're past the security checkpoint, EVERYTHING is connected. People complain about the long walkways but really I'd rather have a long, air conditioned connector with a moving walkway then have to leave security and comeback through just to have a shorter walk! I've never had to connect flights at this airport but I know how much of a pain that can be if you have to leave a secure area to get to another set of gates. \n\nThe roads in and out of the terminals are great and simple to understand with a cell phone lot on each end which I think is a big deal, makes things simpler. They also just finished the PHX Sky Train (see review) from Metro rail and parking so getting in and out of the airport core is now even simpler. Also has a future extension being built to T3 right now so just in case you do need to switch terminals, this will greatly simplify things for you as well. It really seems like in general they are always trying to improve Sky Harbor and that's what I love about it most. My biggest complaint is that things were becoming run down and old but even that they are changing quickly by remodeling restrooms, laying new carpet, replacing all old signs with new, easier to read, streamlined blue and silver signs. \n\nMyself I know that I can't wait for friends and family to fly in or me fly out just so I can use this great airport we have here. With all the new improvements there is little not to love here, especially once the Sky Train is complete and serves T3 and the Rental Car Center, all bus shuttles will be eliminated and T2 will eventually be closed and things will be simple, cool, and efficient at Sky Harbor. Until then they are always working to reach that pinnacle of big city airport perfection, and it really shows.",1
The car rental center is a joke!  Give yourself TONS of time.  Talk about a waste of fuel and added pollution,0
"I don't like this airport very much in particular the US Airways terminals. They need updating, more power outlets, renovated bathrooms, etc. Terminal B is just horrendous.\nI only gave them the two stars because of the Southwest terminals which are great or else it would only been the single star! If you travel through here try to avoid the US airways terminals if you can.",0
"I was really upset with US airways for flight delays and then refusing me entry to my flight 5 mins before departure. I was upset. The US airways customer service got me on the next flight quickly but could not offer me any other compensation. \n\nHowever the Phoenix airport itself was charming in an old way and had a decent selection of food choices. I tried modern burger and that was good. Some wait but worth it. And the few places beside it looked great too!\n\nThe best thing here!! Free wifi, unlimited! Very helpful for the girl who got stranded. \n\nAlso while I was rushing for my flight along with many other customers, a very kind employee who was driving those airport carts grabbed us on and got us to our gates in 5 minutes! Though that was not enough.... Btw, the carts are free and you're free to provide tips to show your gratitude. \n\nLastly, know that the Phoenix airport is HuGEEEEEE. There are walking escalators but you need probably 15 to 20 minutes to get to the ends of the airport.",1
"To me, this airport is way more complicated than it needs to be. Security sucks, they have it set up horribly with everyone shoved in a corner and the people are mean. I'm not a dumb traveller, i follow the rules and have everything opened and placed quickly so that I can go through security as fast as possible. They still, however, insist that I go through the full body scanner (\""""the violator\""""), and have even criticized my clothing choice (the zippers on the ankles of my skinny jeans should not cause alarm, seriously). \n\nThe way that the terminals are separated, with specific restaurants in different areas, makes it so you have to walk forever through a maze of people, employees etc. It's just ridiculous. The have advertisements of being \""""America's friendliest airport\""""... but compared to Portland, that's a bad joke. I'd much rather fly to Tucson, at least they have more space and the people are nicer.",0
"I hate this airport, friendliest my ASS! From security to gate agents to bus drivers to parking cashiers, this is one of the LEAST friendly airports I have ever subjected myself to. I've lived in many cities and currently have to endure the complete crap this airport is in every imaginable way. I'm so frustrated with it I will consider driving to LAX just to avoid using this shit hole. Yup, sitting here now after getting effed by United on a code share with Lufthansa. Umm, Lufthansa... why do you code share with this abomination of an airline? Maybe driving to Tucson is an option because I am not coming back to this place. PHX? BOO!",0
"Horribly designed airport.  I have never been to an airport where I have to pass through security again when making connections to another airline (except international destinations).  Can any of your readers give another airport that requires this?  Dark, dirty, crowded concourses.  I try to go through Denver instead, but not always possible.  I fly 35-40 times/year.  Not a friendly airport, regardless what the signs promote.",0
"I hate this foresaken place. To go from one terminal to the other you have to walk for two days and get blisters on the palms of your feet!!! It has the worst set up, no trams what so ever, the waiting areas are tiny tiny tiny; there is no where to sit, you see tons of people sitting on the floor. Not a lot of places to eat either and the restaurants all serve their beer in plastic cups, how classy is that for a $10 beer? I can't rate check in or security check thru's because I only experienced a connecting flight but my experience was a 0 star, nightmare!",0
"Average airport. The layout of the place is pretty odd. Its spread out pretty far and wide (lots of walking). On-site rentals would be nice, but not here. Taking a shuttle to the 3 different terminals is a bit of pain as well, especially when your airline is different then what is printed on your ticket.",0
"Most of this airport seems really nice. The security wasn't bad, but it was late afternoon, so I think we caught a good time.\n\nI, however, got stuck in the Delta terminal, and it was the worst airport experience of my life. First of all, there was a Starbucks that closed at six pm, y'all. SIX. There was this little burrito place that my friend and I decided to eat at because our only other options were Wendy's or a gift/convenience shop. That food was just.. no. It was not the worst I've ever had, but I wish I'd have gotten Wendy's. We were told it was the oldest wing of the airport.\n\nThe lady in the gift shop was really nice and told us our options, which was to go back out and then come back through security, or pick one of the two whole options inside. It was tiny, old, and definitely not built for the 21st century.",0
"This is truly one of the nicer airports. The staff are friendly & helpful. Even tho they took my shampoo, I wasn't made to feel like a criminal for having shampoo.  Going & coming was a good experience.",1
"I've never been a fan of Phoenix's Sky Harbor. Seems liek I always have to switch concourses or at least the wing of the concourse and my flights usually get delayed.\n\nNot sure what the reasons are, but it makes me want to take measures to avoid this airport and I fly ALOT!",0
"Beware there is little to no food on the US Airways concourse A!!! I have been flying all day an finally had a layover. I was so excited to get something to eat and sit down at a restaurant.... I got off the plane and started walking to find only two sandwich grab and go places on the terminal! I was sooo upset. There are plenty of signs stating that food and restaurants are coming soon, but that didn't help me tonight!",0
"So I'm leaving on a jet planeeeeee..\nDon't know when I'll be back againnn....\n\nWell I always get so excited everytime I go here. Its just the whole feeling of going on a trip or just picking up business clients or family or friends from the airport. As much traffic it was during the day, I still get that happy feelings everytime I drive here..",1
Once i stepped off the plane it smelled like puke.  WTF?,0
"Why does everyone rate this airport so low? I don't think it's fair to judge typical airport issues for one particular airport. That's traveling. Get there early and be patient! \n\nI love that this airport keeps improving. With the addition of many local Phoenix culinary favorites and free wifi, I'd never be bored or unhappy here! Also I rode the shiny new Sky Train the other day and it was cool. I know other airports have this too, no big deal, but I have watched it being built and it's nice to see all of their hard work finally completed. \n\nRestaurants to try: Chelsea's Kitchen, Barrio Cafe, La Grande Orange, Cowboy Ciao and Olive & Ivy if you want to experience a little Phoenix flavor without leaving the airport. \n\nAnother thing I love about this place is the art on display throughout the facility. Beautiful!",1
"What a cluster this airport is! It is dark and drab and the people who work here are not very friendly (unlike they claim to be). My boyfriend and I recently had a layover here. When we arrived, we were informed that our flight would have am hour and a half delay. We were ok with this as it gave us time to get a bite to eat. 20 min before our flight was supposed to leave, they made an announcment that our gate was changed TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE AIRPORT! \n\nAs we speed walked our way with the rest of the passengers on our 100% full flight, we realized that they changed two more flights to the section we were going to. Once we arrived, they announced that a flight was changed BACK to the original gate. The announcement was so unclear that many people on our flight started heading back when the airport personel finally clarified that it was one of the other flights that changed back.\n\nThese people need to get it together.",0
Way nicer than my LAX airport.,1
"Dave goes to New Mexico part 1.\n\nWell, I already reviewed my home airport - John Wayne, so I will say that I started my long travel day there after the quick drive from home. John Wayne was, as always, clean and pretty efficient.\n\nMy plane landed at Phoenix Sky Harbor at about 10:00.  I was meeting my boss who was coming in from Ontario.  We were heading to New Mexico.  We had about 90 minutes to kill in Phoenix.\n\nThe restaurants are pretty slim pickings inside security at Phoenix.  My boss needed a pair of sunglasses since she forgot hers.  There was no place to buy sunglasses inside security.  Neither of us wanted to leave the secure area because of the lines to get back to the gates.  We just decided to try to find some seats and wait out or layover.\n\nNot my favorite airport experience.",0
"Worst airport ever. I understand and am totally ok with being searched by another female as long as its a search that every women gets regardless of race. They are afraid to offend certain races. I wore a long dress and was searched but they certainly didn't search the woman wearing a head wrap and a long dress. They're employees were rude and bc our flight was a late one there wasn't any food inside the terminal. Don't fly in or out of here if you can avoid it,",0
"BLUH. Just...bluh. \n\nI had a layover in Phoenix when I was in the process of moving to ABQ and the airport was...gross. I really don't know how to describe it other than crusty and needing a massive scrub down. Then when it came to the overhead announcements, you couldn't understand what the staff were saying because the intercom kept going out and you'd catch particles of their message. That was pretty annoying since I had to SPRINT across the airport to reach my connecting flight and it wasn't displayed on the screens for some random reason. \n\nI'm just hoping I don't have to use them again any time soon as a connection point to visit family back in California!",0
"One of the worst airports ever, I have not been treated like this at LAX or ONT even in Sydney's airport they asked me not to remove my shoes cuz they are Converse the high top, I mean what could u possibly hide in you converse, not even a pack of gum, but in Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport the story is different, my bag had to go in twice, even though there is nothing there but bunch of underwear and an iPad .. and after that they had to swab it   and search it, and the lady was so rude saying, OMG underwear in carryon, and I kept quiet .. and went through the metal detector, and beeped OK but they had to pat me down and search my pockets, and the sad part they let some people walk through with out going through the metal detector and they were really on a very bad behavior talking about drugs and street fight while waiting on the line, All that based on the color of the passengers skin.\nSo when they were done searching, swabing and talking to each other, they left my bad open and the told me to take it of somewhere else to put it back cuz \""""I'm holding up the line\""""..\n\nZero star for the worst shit hole ever\n\nif u wanna be all good about security then you should do that with all the passengers not according to their skin color. \n\nFUCK U Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport  I will never fly thru u again and none of my friends will..",0
"Very confusing... North South 1,2,3 or 4 and where do I pick up the rent a car shttle.  I do like the close car waiting areas but pay attention or you'll be looping around alot.",0
Worst airport ever!!! Flight deck staff are so rude! Staff at the airport as well. So rude!!!  I live inflows Angeles and have never been treated so badly in my life!!!,0
"I love Sky Harbor. Whether I am traveling or just there for a pick up or drop off, it is the easiest airport to get around. Good signage and not too jam packed. I think I have used all terminals at one time or another and have never had an issue.",1
"I haven't flown in 5 or 6 years and wasn't really looking forward to experiencing the \""""joy\"""" that is an airport. I've always heard you have to be at the airport two hours in advance and with our flight being at 6:30am that means being there are 4:30am. Luckily, the traffic at this hour was minimal and getting in was a breeze. Additionally, the airport seemed pretty dead. Not too many other flyers going at this hour on a Friday morning. We were able to go through the full body scanners relatively quickly and then wait around for our plane. (We headed on over to La Grand Orange - see review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-grande-orange-phoenix#hrid:9E12RVBuQNPZY0ZGfq2Mog) Finding our gate was easy, but seemed to be the last gate for section C. There was plenty of seating and the wait wasn't too terrible. We boarded on time and took off. I would recommend getting a direct flight, as ours was not and the wait became an extended 3 hour stay. \n\nThe return flight was just as easy breezy. We landed on time, I was able to get out of the plane quickly, and then I easily made it to the baggage area to claim my luggage. My ride was waiting outside to pick me up, so we were on our way. Overall, it was a good experience.",1
"Love this airport. The airport itself is very nice, with friendly staff and volunteers (look for the people in purple before TSA) to help you get where you are going. Pre security is pretty nice. Good selection of restaurants. Also, this has to be one of the few large airports in the US to offer free and reasonably fast Wi-Fi. I personally enjoy the speed and efficiency of this airport.\nFor those of you who say that the airport is in need of some new carpet: I agree. Those of you who think the layout is stupid: you are wrong. Airports aren't supposed to be a work of art. If you were to know a single thing about architecture, airport planning, and industrial design, you would realize that the way the airport is laid out is really efficient. You can quickly get to your terminal, and the E shape is so that airplanes can park on either side of the extending structures. Pre security is pretty nice.\nFor those of you who gave the airport itself a bad review because of an experience that you had with an airline, your review belongs on that airline's respective page. It is really misguiding when you rate an airport poorly because of a bad experience with an airline. You are supposed to rate and review the airport itself.  If you think this airport is bad, it must be the only airport in the world where you have spent a long delay or layover. Spend an 8 hour delay at JFK's terminal 2 or at O'Hare, and then we will talk.",1
Overall I really like this airport.  Access to the airport from multiple roadways helps reduce the traffic coming in.  I usually fly United or US Airways (star alliance) here and security is always quite fast.  Once you are inside the concourses are laid out efficiently and there are plenty of people movers in between.  There is free wifi here that is actually quite fast 3.89Mbps download and 31.48Mbps upload(speedtest.net).  Pretty good selection of restuarants.  As far as airports go this one is highly recommended.,1
"If you're heading to Terminal 3, make sure to eat and get coffee BEFORE going through security. Food/shopping option in the terminal are terrible!",0
Crowded with overpriced food :(,0
